Near-record agricultural output and important policy measures, including the unification of most official exchange rates, led to an increase in private investment (for the first time in four years) and real GDP growth of over .5 percent. Intensified collection of tax arrears, together with the depreciation of the budget accounting exchange rate, partly offset the impact of the sharp decline in oil export prices (-37 percent) on the budget deficit, which widened to 4 percent of GDP from 2% percent in 1997. Declining import prices contributed to negative consumer price inflation (-0.4 percent). . The external current account surplus narrowed by 2% percent of GDP due to the drop in oil export prices. However, the capital account improved significantly as the sizable repayment of principal arrears to the World Bank in 1997 was not repeated, so that official reserves were built up to the equivalent of 7 months’ merchandise imports. Discussions with Germany and the Russian Federation on debt settlement, and formal negotiations toward an association agreement with the E.U. were continued in 1998-99. Prospects for 1999 and the Medium Term . Severe drought in 1999 will constrain growth to about 1 percent and reduce fiscal revenues. The fiscal deficit is expected to widen slightly to about 4% percent of GDP and the external current account will move into deficit of about 2 percent of GDP due mainly to lower cereals exports and imports associated with a new gas development project. . Under the current policy stance of gradual liberalization of the economy and tight expenditure control, the external position should not come under pressure over the medium term However, fiscal revenues should be enhanced to offset the loss of customs duties as free trade agreements are implemented, and to meet the higher debt-service payments as relations with creditors are norrnalized. In the absence of an accelerated reform process, private investment would remain below its potential and constrain annual GDP growth to a level that would be insufficient to provide full employment for the rapidly growing labor force. Views of the Authorities . The Syrian authorities recognize that measures are needed to stimulate private investment and reinvigorate growth. To this end, additional investment incentives and the unification of customs valuation rates will be introduced in 1999. They believe, however, that an acceleration of reforms would run the risk of engendering social unrest if prices of subsidized goods were raised sharply and employment in the public sector was reduced. Therefore, they prefer to continue with their approach of gradual liberalization. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- Staff Appraisal . The low level of inflation, stable free-market exchange rate, and the tight stance of financial policies provide an opportune moment to broaden and accelerate the pace of reforms in order to boost private sector investment, productivity growth, and employment creation. The two-stage approach that was recommended last year remains valid. The first stage measures should be implemented in 1999: moving the official exchange rate in discrete steps to the level of the free market exchange rate; eliminating the 25 percent surrender requirement on proceeds from manufactures exports; simplifying import restrictions to a single “negative list”; reducing the subsidy on fuel oil; and introducing a sales tax at the manufacturing and import level. . Second stage structural reforms, which would require significant preparatory work, include the relaxation of price controls and a streamlining of administrative procedures; a civil service reform and a review of the public investment program; the introduction of a general income tax and conversion of the sales tax into a value added tax; rationalization of the tariff system; establishing a system to target subsidies to protect vulnerable groups; freeing up the operations of public enterprises; and introducing competition into the financial system once prudential supervision capability in the central bank is established and the accounting and payment systems are upgraded. . The process of regularizing Syria’s debts to external creditors through bilateral negotiations should be accelerated. An agreement with Germany would permit access to sizable external financing resources from the E.U. . Although some progress has been made in reducing the shortcomings in the Syrian data system, important deficiencies remain, including lack of consistency between the fiscal, monetary, and balance of payments accounts. Greater efforts to address these issues and to improve the timeliness and quality of data for surveillance between consultations are required.

The 1999 Article IV consultation discussions with Syria took place in Damascus during April I-15, 1999.i The mission met with H.E. Mohammed Al-Imady, Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade, H.E. Khaled Al-Mahayni, Minister of Finance, and The Honorable Mohammad B. Kabbarah, Governor of the Central Bank of Syria, as well as with other senior government offtcials and with representatives of the private sector. 2. In concluding the 1998 Article IV consultation on June 15, 1998, Executive Directors underscored the need to introduce a comprehensive set of reforms in the financial, trade, and exchange systems in order to encourage private investment and exports, and restore a high rate of economic growth. Directors called for the early regularization of relations with external creditors to facilitate additional foreign financing and enhance private sector confidence. Directors also noted the pervasive weaknesses in the Syrian data system, and urged the authorities to give high priority to addressing them. Syria continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, and also maintains exchange measures that are subject to approval under Article VIII. 3. The consultation discussions took place against the backdrop of a severe drought in 1999 and uncertain regional prospects due to the decline in oil export revenue that has affected Syria and the GCC countries, as well as to the continued lack of progress in the Middle East peace process. However, with the outcome of the recent Israeli elections, a revival of the peace process is widely expected. The discussions focused on the policies needed to tap Syria’s strong economic potential and provide an enabling environment for its entrepreneurial private sector.’ II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS A. Background 4. In the first half of the 199Os, Syria undertook a series of economic reform measures, the most important of which were the opening of new areas of activity to the private sector, the provision of strong fiscal incentives to private investors (Investment Law No. 10 of 1991), the simplification of the exchange system and gradual depreciation of the remaining official rates, the relaxation of import controls, and the increase in agricultural procurement ‘The mission comprised Messrs. Jbili (Head), Alexander, Iradian, Krichene, and Fonteyne (all MED). Mr. Nashashibi (MED) attended the policy meetings. ‘Syria’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II, respectively.

The private sector responded favorably to these measures, raising its share of output to about 50 percent by 1995 (Box 1). Assisted also by higher oil production and sharply higher agricultural output, real GDP growth averaged 7 percent over 1991-95. Exports rose sharply, and foreign exchange reserves were built up to the equivalent of four months of merchandise imports by 1995 (Table 1). Box 1. The Public and Private Sectors . On average over 1992-97, the private sector accounted for 5 1 percent of GDP, 72 percent of total employment, 57 percent of gross capital formation, 69 percent of non-oil exports, and 58 percent of imports. However, its share in bank credit was small at about 26 percent compared with 57 percent for the public enterprises. . While the private sector is predominant in agricultural production, the marketing of cereals through the General Organization for Cereals Production and Trade, and the processing and marketing of cotton through the General Organization for Cotton Ginning and Marketing are reserved for the public sector. Other activities reserved for the public sector are cotton spinning (except that the private sector may conduct integrated spinning and weaving operations), mineral water production, and banking and insurance. . Oil and natural gas activities, including refining, are fully government-owned, but there are oil production-sharing arrangements with a number of foreign companies. Utilities were fully government owned until 1997 when the first privately-owned power plant was approved. In manufacturing, the public sector is predominant in large scale and in heavy industries such as textiles, cement, fertilizers, and electrical and household appliances. In the construction sector, public and private enterprises are equally important in terms of output and employment. In the services sector, the communications industry, the air transportation industry, and all financial institutions, including the single insurance company, are government owned. In the trade sector, many large public enterprises have a key role in the import and marketing of consumer goods. There are no plans to privatize public enterprises. . Notwithstanding the substantial progress in liberalising the economy during the 199Os, the private sector still faces major impediments in the form of a multiple exchange regime, a complicated trade system with two positive import lists (goods which may be financed from any source, and goods which must be financed from export proceeds), administrative rigidities, high corporate profit tax rates for projects not benefiting from investment incentives, limited acceaa to domestic credit, and a non-competitive and rudimentary banking system. 5. The initial favorable response was not sustained, however, reflecting both adverse exogenous factors-including a lack of progress in the Middle East peace process which undermined private sector confidence--as well as slow progress in removing the remaining Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- Table 1.

Nonetheless, fiscal and monetary policies remained tight, which helped to reduce inflation and further strengthen international reserves. B. Developments in 1998 6. In 1998, the authorities continued the gradual liberalization of the exchange and trade regimes. An important step was taken at the beginning of the year when virtually all official exchange rates were unified at LS 45.5 per US$l. In August, the official rate was depreciated to LS 46.5 per USSI, thereby reducing the gap with the free market exchange rate of LS 5 l-52 to about 10 percent (Table 2 and Chart 1). Work was initiated, with Fund technical assistance, on the introduction of the Harmonized System of Tariff Classification, the unification of customs valuation exchange rates, and the removal of anomalies in the tariff system.4 In addition, tariffs on imports from Arab countries were reduced by 10 percent in September, and all nontariff restrictions on imports from Arab countries were removed in accordance with the provisions of the Arab Free Trade Agreement (AFTA). 7. Other initiatives in 1998 included the refund of production taxes on agricultural products and their manufactures to exporters and the removal of the ceiling of the value of “suitcase” exports accompanying the traveler. Transfers between foreign exchange accounts at the Commercial Bank of Syria (COBS) were permitted, thereby establishing the conditions for the emergence of a foreign exchange market.’ Also, in an effort to encourage domestic ‘Syria continues to maintain, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, including the administrative allocation of foreign exchange. Syria also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII: (i) a prohibition against purchases by private parties of foreign exchange from the banking system for most current international transactions; (ii) multiple currency practices resulting from divergences between the official exchange rate and the rates applicable to debt service payments under bilateral payments agreements, and to transactions in the export proceeds market; and (iii) a 100 percent advance import deposit requirement for public sector imports. In addition, Syria is a net debtor under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with Fund members-the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Russian Federation, and Sri Lanka-each of which gives rise to an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval. 4There are three customs valuation rates in effect: LS 11.25,23.00, and 46.50 per US. dollar, applying, in principle, to raw materials, intermediate goods, and final use goods, respectively. 5There was little response to this measure, reflecting in part the uncertainty caused by the coexistence of Law No. 24 of 1984 which imposes severe penalties for the possession of foreign exchange.

Notwithstanding a 37 percent decline in oil export prices, the economy performed well in 1998 due to a strong rebound in agricultural production reflecting the return of good weather conditions. After three years of consecutive decline, private investment is estimated to have risen by about 16 percent in 1998, partly in response to the additional liberalization measures noted above. Real agricultural GDP rose by IO’/2 percent, and with a modest increase in public and private investment, real non-agricultural GDP increased by 3% percent, or by slightly more than in 1997 (Chart 2). Sectors showing faster growth included natural gas, manufacturing, utilities, and trade. Total real GDP is estimated to have increased by about 5 percent in 1998 compared with about 1 percent in 1997. 9. Consumer price inflation declined further to -0.4 percent in 1998 after slowing to 2 percent in 1997. The continued fall reflected lower import prices, excess supplies of liuits and vegetables and declining rental costs, as well as modest growth in domestic demand. Nonetheless, there remained some repression of inflation as administered prices of major food staples and strategic commodities (mainly bread, rice and sugar, and petroleum .products, fertilizers and building materials) have not been increased since 199495. 10. The fiscal position deteriorated in 1998. While the decline in oil-related revenue was offset by higher non-oil revenue, stemming from improved tax collection, total expenditure rose by 7 percent (Table 3 and Chart 3). Current expenditures rose modestly reflecting higher expenditure on wages and on goods and services, while subsidies and transfers declined. Development expenditures rose from 12.4 percent of GDP in 1997 to 12.8 percent as power plants and textile mills were upgraded. As a result, the overall deficit widened to almost 4 percent of GDP, with about two-thirds being financed by external borrowing and the remainder from domestic sources. 11. Domestic liquidity expanded by 9 percent in 1998 (slightly more than in 1997) reflecting the accumulation of net foreign assets by both the central bank and the COBS (Table 4). Domestic credit declined by 4 percent as net credit to the central government continued to contract sharply, and claims on public enterprises and the private sector rose only marginally (Chart 4).6 12. The external current account weakened significantly in 1998 due to the fall in international oil prices (Table 5 and Chart 5). Affected also by marginally lower oil production, oil export revenue declined by 5 percent of GDP. Although there was a pick up 6The fiscal and monetary accounts are broadly consistent with regard to the financing of the budget deficit if the Price Stabilization Fund is treated as a government agency financed by the banking system through loans to public enterprises. Nonetheless, a discrepancy still remains, which the authorities will attempt to reconcile.

However, there was a sizable improvement in the financial account in 1998 as the repayment of principal arrears to the World Bank (US$270 million) in 1997 was not repeated. An overall surplus of more than US$O.3 billion was recorded, which enabled the central bank to build up foreign exchange reserves by US$O.2 billion to US$l.9 billion (7 months of merchandise imports). 13. The free market exchange rate for the Syrian pound against the U.S. dollar remained stable in 1998 in the range of LS 50.8-52.8 per US$l. Since 1993, this rate has depreciated only slightly (Table 1). Although the real effective free market exchange rate- which is relevant for private sector external transactionsdepreciated by 2 percent in 1998, the cumulative appreciation over 1992-98 was 47 percent due to a higher rate of inflation in Syria than in trading partners (before 1997) and to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of Syria’s European trading partners (in 199698). This indicates some deterioration in the price competitiveness of the Syrian economy. Nonetheless, given that other countries in the region have also experienced appreciating real effective exchange rates since 1992, Syria has gained in price competitiveness vis-a-vis Lebanon, has maintained competitiveness in relation to Egypt, but has lost ground to Jordan and Turkey (Chart 1). 14. Syria’s officially acknowledged external debt at end-1998 was US$4.9 billion (30 percent of GDP).’ Of this amount, the staff estimates that about 65 percent is owed to bilateral creditors, especially Japan and Germany, 10 percent to multilateral institutions, and 25 percent (mostly short-term) to banks and suppliers. Converting ruble debt to the Russian Federation (RFtwhich is mostly in arrears-at the official exchange rate (US$J=SlJR 0.6) and applying the discount of 65 percent as agreed with the Paris Club for countries with a large military debt, would imply an additional debt of US$4.4 billion (27 percent of GDP). However, Syria has counter-claims against this debt and negotiations toward a settlement were continued in 1998-99. 15. Total external arrears outstanding are estimated by the staff at US$1.7 billion (excluding arrears to the RF), with the largest amounts owed to Germany, the United States, and Japan. Following the significant steps taken up to 1997 to reduce external arrears through bilateral negotiations, new agreements were reached with Hungary and Romania (in part) in 1998.’ Negotiations are continuing with the RF and Germany, but progress in the latter has ‘Officially acknowledged debt excludes ruble debt to the Russian Federation and probably excludes late interest obligations on debt to the Paris Club. The staff has been unable to obtain detailed information from the authorities because of an inadequate debt reporting system (which is being upgraded with assistance from the World Bank). The most recent information provided to the staff by the Paris Club was as of October 1994. s During 1991-97, debt settlements were reached with Belgium, Bulgaria (in part), Denmark, France, The Netherlands, France, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The lack of a settlement with Germany has, until recently, prevented the reactivation of lending by the European Investment Bank (EIB). However, in May 1999, the EIB approved a loan of c75 million out of e225 million in project loans that had been earmarked for Syria in the mid- 1990s. III. PROSPECTSFORI~~~ANDTHEMEDIUMTERM 16. Growth prospects in 1999 are clouded by a severe drought which will adversely affect a impact. P ‘cultural output, and a number of measures have been authorized to mitigate its The drought may also affect some non-agricultural sectors indirectly. Nonetheless, given the limited growth prospects for crude oil production, construction, and trade, the growth of total GDP may drop to about 1 percent. 17. The expected fiscal outturn reflects the broad outlines of the 1999 budget.” Oil- related revenues are projected to increase slightly due to the upturn in oil export prices. Non- oil-related revenues, however, are expected to decline by about two percentage points of GDP owing to the slowdown in economic activity, the absence of increases in administered prices of basic commodities and public services, unchanged customs receipts (the planned unification of customs valuation exchange rates will be revenue neutral), and a drop in other tax revenues as the intensified collection of tax arrears in 1998 could not be repeated. Expenditure on food-related subsidies would remain high, but total subsidies would decline because export subsidies on wheat would be eliminated due to the sharp decline in wheat output. Moreover, current and development expenditures would be limited to their 1998 level, implying a reduction in total expenditure by about one percentage point of GDP. On this basis, the overall fiscal deficit would widen slightly to about 4% percent of GDP. Also in 1997, an agreement was reached with the World Bank under which Syria paid US$270 million in principal arrears in September 1997 and has remained current in repaying interest arrears and principal falling due at the agreed rate of US$6.1 million per month. The World Bank may only provide nonlending services to Syria until arrears are cleared in 2002, but the IFC is considering equity investments in or loans to the Syrian private sector. ‘Imports of barley and animal feeds will be increased substantially, interest payments due by farmers will be cancelled and loan repayments rescheduled, and new loans will be provided. ‘OThe 1999 budget had not been finalized at the time of the mission, but its broad outlines were discussed with the authorities.

The external current account is expected to move to a small deficit reflecting lower cereals exports due to the drought, and sizable private sector imports associated with a new gas development project.” Oil exports would increase slightly as lower production would bc more than offset by higher prices. The gas-related imports would be financed by direct investment inflows resulting in a sizable surplus in the financial account, which would enable the overall balance to remain in small surplus. 19. With a smaller impetus to monetary expansion coming from the growth of net foreign assets than in 1998, but larger financing of the budget deficit required from the domestic banking system, the credit needs of the public enterprises and the private sector could be satisfied while limiting overall money growth to about 7 percent; this would exceed the projected growth of nominal GDP of 4% percent. With the small projected rise in import prices and higher food prices due to drought, consumer prices could increase by about 2% percent in 1999. 20. The outlook for the medium term will be affected by a number of factors. Growth will be constrained by declining oil production, water shortages which will limit the capacity to expand irrigated agriculture, and uncertain prospects for private investment in the absence of major policy changes. The development of natural gas reserves will improve the balance of payments position through exports of condensate and replacement of petroleum products imports, but will provide only limited employment opportunities. Under current policies, Syria could achieve a real GDP growth of about 4 percent per year on average, which would be insufficient to provide employment opportunities for the 150,00&200,000 new entrants to the labor force each year.‘* In the absence of new measures to mobilize domestic revenues, the fiscal deficit would stabilize at 3% percent of GDP due to continued containment of expenditures and the slow recovery of oil prices. The external current account deficit would widen to 3 percent of GDP in 2000 on account of gas project-related imports, but after the gas project comes fully on-stream in 2002, the deficit would be reduced to about 1% percent of GDP in succeeding years. These deficits could be financed without difficulty given recent “The project involves direct investment of US$430 million by Conoco and Elf Aquitane to recover gas now being flared for use in domestic industry (thereby releasing fuel oil for export), and to boost reservoir pressure to increase the production of condensate and LPG.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS 21. Main issues. In the light of the medium-term outlook noted above, the policy discussions centered on how to reinvigorate growth and achieve a long-run improvement in the living standards of a rapidly growing population. The mission stressed that while considerable progress had been achieved in recent years in providing an environment conducive to private sector investment, the reform effort had stalled and it was now time to move boldly ahead to achieve a critical mass of reforms that would remove the remaining impediments to private sector initiative and growth. Such a reform package would also permit Syria to maximize the potential benefits of its integration into the world economy through the AFTA, the free-trade agreement with Lebanon, the prospective association agreement with the European Union, and potential membership of the WTO by improving its competitiveness vis-a-vis countries in the region which have started earlier and proceeded further than Syria in deregulating their economies. The Syrian representatives recognized the need to boost private investment and restore a high rate of economic growth but held that a gradual and measured pace of reform was more consistent with the need to preserve social stability. 22. A two-phased approach to reform. As suggested during the 1998 Article IV consultation,‘4 discussions focused around a two-stage approach to reform that would also take into account the authorities concerns regarding social stability. The first stage, which could be implemented in 1999, would involve the removal of the remaining barriers to private investment and exports and further fiscal strengthening, while the second stage would focus on medium-term structural reforms that require significant technical preparation and consensus building (Box 2). The mission underscored that a rapid implementation of reforms under this two-stage approach would improve the long-run growth and employment prospects. A. Exchange Rate Reform 23. The mission noted that the unification of virtually all official exchange rates in 1998 and the depreciation of the unified rate closer to the market rate was a major step forward in “The detailed medium-term scenario which assumes the continuation of current policies is shown in Annex 1. I4 M/98/125 (6/2/98), paragraph 28. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- eliminating the distortive effects of the exchange regime. However, the appreciation of the real effective free-market exchange rate since 1992, together with other impediments to export development-lack of marketing expertise and quality control-could be indicative of a loss of competitiveness. Accordingly, the mission pointed out that the time was opportune to unify the exchange regime by depreciating the official rate to the market rate level in 1999. This could be implemented in one or more discrete steps, and would need to be supported by tight fiscal and monetary policies to prevent the depreciation of the free market rate. At a later stage, following the development of a foreign exchange market in Syria, the authorities could consider introducing more flexibility in exchange rate policy to enhance the competitiveness of Syria’s exports. The staff also called for the elimination of the 25 percent surrender requirement for non-agricultural exports. 24. The Syrian representatives pointed out that the gap between the official and free- market exchange rates was relatively small and did not constitute a major deterrent to private exports. They also expressed concern that large or frequent adjustments in the offtcial rate would have a negative psychological impact on market participants and put pressure on the tiee-market rate. While they agreed that the CPI-based real effective exchange rate had appreciated significantly, they underscored that Syrian wage costs were still very low and that the equilibrium exchange rate could be at a more appreciated level than the present free- market rate; the latter also included a premium for unauthorized trade and capital controls. Therefore, they intended to take further small steps to reduce the gap between the official and the free-market rate but at a measured pace. In addition, they had considered eliminating the surrender requirement, and as a first step had incorporated this measure into a new initiative to revive private investment (see below). B. Promoting Private Sector Investment 25. The Syrian representatives stated that draft legislation had been prepared to amend Investment Law No.10 of 1991 in order to strengthen investment incentives. Measures included allowing 100 percent foreign ownership, providing extended tax exemptions for investment in remote areas, and exempting new investments under the Law from the surrender requirement (Box 3). The mission agreed that the proposed amendment was appropriate as long as the new tax exemptions were offset by other revenue enhancing measures. But it was more important to create an overall environment conducive to private investment by accelerating reforms in other areas. In addition to adopting a transparent exchange regime, Law No. 24 should be repealed to facilitate the emergence of a domestic market in foreign exchange; the new commercial and rental laws which had been under preparation for some time introduced rapidly; the regulatory framework eased; the trade regime simplified; and the banking system revitalized (see below). 26. Relaxation of price controls. The mission noted that the current system of administrative control of prices for strategic commodities and establishing guidelines for the prices of almost all other commodities was cumbersome, expensive to administer, and in some cases distortive. A comprehensive review of the system was needed to eliminate all Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-15- Box 2.

C. Trade Policy 21. The Syrian representatives indicated that preparations had almost been completed for the introduction of the Harmonized System of Tariff Classification, the elimination of distortions in duty rates,15 and the adoption of a unified exchange rate for customs valuation purposes had almost been completed. Although intended originally to be implemented at the beginning of 1999, these measures would be introduced later in the year. While welcoming these steps, the mission recommended that the trade regime be further simplified in 1999 by reducing import restrictions to a single “negative” list, and eliminating the export proceeds market. At a later stage, there should be a phased reduction in the number and dispersion of tariff rates, starting with a reduction in the maximum tariff to 45 percent, and further reductions determined in preparation for the association agreement with the E.U. and possible membership of the WT0.16 The Syrian representatives agreed that the trade regime should be simplified, and to this end, they were examining the impact of the introduction of a single negative list vis-a-vis Arab countries and its possible extension to all countries. At that time, the export proceeds financing requirement would be eliminated. D. Fiscal Policy 28. Fiscal strengthening. The mission observed that under current oil price projections and fiscal policies, the overall deficit would stabilize at about 3% percent of GDP over the medium term (Annex 1). While this deficit could be financed through non-inflationary domestic borrowing and external resources, the fiscal position could come under pressure due to: (i) lower customs revenue as free trade agreements were implemented; (ii) revenue losses stemming from the removal&as recommended by the mission--of the 12.5 percent export tax on raw cotton and production taxes on manufactures exports, and additional tax exemptions under Law No.10; (iii) higher debt-service payments needed to regularize Syria’s relations with external creditors; and (iv) a possible renewed downturn in international oil prices. Consequently, a combination of revenue-enhancing measures and continued expenditure restraint was required to ensure that the deficit remained at a sustainable level. Is Inconsistencies in rate differentiation include higher duty rates applied to goods of lower degrees of processing than goods of higher degrees of processing, which may result in higher rates of effective protection. 16Three formal negotiating sessions toward an association agreement between the Syrian authorities and the E.U. were held in 1998 and a fourth took place in March 1999. The next negotiation will take place in September 1999. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicBox 3. Investment Incentives Under Law 10 of 1991 With a view to reviving private sector activity, Law IO of 1991 (enacted on May 4 of that year) provided for tax xemptions and privileges for new projects in all sectors of the economy that are approved by the Supreme .nveshent Council (SIC). The Law applies to private joint-stock companies or individually-owned companies, md to mixed public/private companies with at least 25 percent private participation. rax exemptions under the Law ) Projects undertaken by joint-stock companies are granted a standard exemption from all central and local income and property taxes for a period of 7 years. Projects undertaken by individuals are exempted from such taxes for a period of 5 years. These exemptions may be extended by two more years if at least 50 percent of the production was exported during the standard exemption period. ) Imports of machinery, capital equipment, and other essential materials necessary for the establishment of a project under the Law were exempted from all taxes, fiscal and municipal duties, and customs duties. w The issuance of shares by joint-stock companies is exempted from stamp duties. Proposed revisions to the Law The changes, approved by the Cabinet and expected to be approved by Parliament later in 1999, are: . Investors may exchange foreign currency to pay the local currency costs of the project at the free-market rate rather than at the neighboring countries rate as at present. I The SIC may approve exceptions to the 25 percent surrender requirement for proceeds from non- agricultural exports whereby investors may retain 100 percent of their earnings in foreign exchange rather than 75 percent as at present. . The SIC may permit an investor to hold export earnings not subject to the surrender requirement in foreign correspondent banks of the COBS. l The SIC may authorize the establishment of holding companies under the Law l The company may be 100 percent foreign-owned; at present, part Syrian ownership is required. l Tax exemptions for up to two additional years will be given to projects located in rural areas, and may be approved by the SIC for projects considered to be sIx+tegically important. l New firms established to cany out projects approved under the Law will be exempted from the stamp tax levied on the registration ofjoint-stock companies. . Foreign investors will be able to purchase land and buildings, rather than rent them as at present. . Projects may be approved by regional offices of the SIC, and procedures will be simplified to provide a single location for lodging applications. . Future changes to the Law may be inimduced by decree rather than by legislation as at present. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public18 29. Revenue measures. On the revenue side, the mission urged that the tax base be broadened by introducing a sales tax at the manufacturing and import level (as recommended by previous Fund technical assistance missions). Also, the corporate income tax should be revised to unify and lower the rates to international standards (3540 percent).17 In a second stage--once the administrative capabilities of the tax department had been strengthened-the sales tax could be transformed into a value added tax and a general income tax could be introduced. 30. Expenditure measures. On the expenditure side, there was an immediate need to reduce subsidies-now amounting to 4.6 percent of GDP-by limiting the subsidized food items to bread, which benefits the lower-income groups more than sugar and rice subsidies, and raising the price of fuel oil which is presently the only petroleum product that is subsidized. To ameliorate the impact of these measures on low income groups, a modest civil service wage increase could be granted.‘* The net effect of these measures would be a saving of 2% percent of GDP on an annual basis. In the second stage, the growth of the wage bill should be constrained by reducing recruitment to the civil service while initiating a civil service reform. Also, in order to further liberalize domestic prices, the bread subsidy should be eliminated gradually and replaced by a social safety net to protect the vulnerable groups of the population. Finally, development expenditures at 12.8 percent of GDP were very high by comparison with other middle income countries. This indicated that the public investment program should be reviewed to identify potential efficiency gains and lay out a strategy for private sector participation in investment in infrastructure. 31. Constraints on policy implementation. The Syrian representatives stated that they were seriously considering the introduction of the proposed sales tax, but that some time may be needed to gather the political support required for this initiative or for reducing bread subsidies without a compensating increase in civil service salaries. However, sugar and rice subsidies would be reduced gradually, and the recent efforts to improve tax collection and strengthen tax administration would be sustained.” Moreover, both current and development expenditures would be reduced in real terms over the medium term. “Currently, the marginal tax rate may reach 65 percent for activities not benefiting from the Investment Law. ” The last general public sector wage increase was in 1994. Consequently, the wage bill as a ratio to GDP has been on a declining trend and is now below 9 percent. However, the civil service is characterized by very low wages which forces most employees to find second jobs and significant excess employment. “Upgraded accounting and statistical systems were being introduced in the Ministry of Finance through technical assistance from bilateral donors and multilateral institutions.

The mission noted that the banking system was dominated by a single commercial bank (the COBS) which aims primarily to finance the government and the public enterprises and does not have the expertise or resources to meet the needs of the private sector. Although the private sector had access to banks in Lebanon and Europe, long-term financing was difficult to obtain and transactions costs were high. 33. The Syrian representatives acknowledged that fundamental reforms were required in the banking system and indicated that considerable progress was being made in the first stage of this effort-the modemization of accounting and payment systems and the training of staff-with technical assistance provided by the E.U. to the central bank, the COBS, and the specialized banks. Once complete, this upgrading would permit the introduction of greater competition within the sector. While no decisions had been made on the form this competition should take, consideration was being given to eliminating the segmentation of bank activities between the COBS and the specialized banks, breaking up the COBS into two or more entities, and introducing joint-venture banks with Syrian nationals living abroad. However, allowing the entry of fully privately-owned banks was not being considered at this time. As an interim step to better serve the private sector in its export activities, an Export Promotion Bank, would be established in 1999. 34. The mission agreed that the technical capabilities of the banks should be strengthened before introducing more competition into the banking system. This would set the stage for allowing greater flexibility in interest rate determination which would help develop the tools needed to conduct monetary policy using indirect instruments. The mission also observed that the establishment of a banking system with international standards of service and efficiency would require that skilled personnel be attracted and retained through salaries that are dehnked from the civil service salary structure. 35. The mission underscored the need to restore the legal authority and enhance the capabilities of the central bank to exercise effective oversight of bank activity and to develop supervision capabilities. While the capital adequacy ratios of the banks were below the minimum recommended by the Basle committee, most lending was to government and public enterprises, and thus carried an implicit government guarantee. Lending to the private sector was mostly fully collateralized and carried low risk so that at present, only one specialized bank-the Industrial Development Bank-had some doubtful loans2’ 36. The Syrian representatives responded that the authorities were reviewing the draft Central Bank Law produced in 1996 with MAE technical assistance, which would give the central bank the authority to conduct monetary policy and to oversee the financial system. In 201nfotmation on the amount of nonperforming loans was not available. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - this regard, a supervision department would be established in the context of the technical assistance being provided by the E.U. F. Public Enterprise Reform 37. The Syrian representatives stated that a pilot project of “management by objective” was underway for four major public enterprises (yam, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and glass), whereby management would be given broad freedom to achieve agreed goals. While welcoming this development, the mission noted that this should be a first step toward a more comprehensive reform which would make public enterprises subject to tight budget constraints, reduce their reliance on the government budget, eliminate subsidized borrowing, and allow full flexibility in employment decisions, wage policy, pricing, and access to foreign exchange. Furthermore, the mission observed, where goods and services could be delivered by the private sector efficiently and at competitive prices, the authorities should consider privatizing these activities, thereby improving resource allocation and allowing public resources to be devoted to the delivery of public services. The Syrian representatives commented that there was an important role for the public sector in the economy and that the authorities’ intention was to promote private sector activity and improve the performance of public enterprises. G. External Debt Issues 38. The mission observed that only modest progress had been made in 1998 in regularizing relations with foreign creditors under the authorities’ preferred bilateral approach to debt settlement. However, in the light of the need to mobihze substantial long- term financing resources, including unlocking significant financial and technical assistance from the E.U. in preparation for the association agreement, this process would need to be accelerated in the period ahead. H. Statistical Issues 39. Modest improvement in the statistical base. The mission noted that some progress had been made in 1998-99 in improving Syria’s statistical base (Appendix IV). The national accounts in constant prices had been rebased from 1985 to 1995, a new industry survey had been introduced, and work is continuing on moving to the 1993 SNA methodology. A new consumer price index had been introduced in January 1999. The compilation lag in the provision of monetary data by the central bank and some specialized banks had been shortened considerably, due in part to the provision of technical assistance by the E.U. in the modemization of accounting systems, computerization, and training. However, significant shortcomings still remained in the areas of national accounts, fiscal and balance of payments data, and international reserves. These shortcomings have so far prevented the supply of core data to the Fund on a regular basis. The Syrian representatives acknowledged these deficiencies, but indicated that the upgrading of the accounts and computerization of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-21- Ministry of Finance now underway would assist in the reconciliation process. More timely reporting of monetary data could also be expected. Moreover, in the light of the regional seminar on the General Data Dissemination System held at the end of 1998, the authorities were considering their possible participation in the system as a means of achieving a comprehensive improvement in the data base over the long term. 40. Year-2000 readiness. The Syrian representatives stated that because of the limited computerization of the economy until recently, there were no significant difficulties in preparing for the end-year transition. Information systems in the hydrocarbon sector had already been tested with the assistance of foreign partner companies. Testing of the banking and insurance systems’ operations for Y2K compliance would be completed by mid-1999. If problems did arise, many sectors of the economy would be able to fall back on hand compilation until the difficulties were solved. V. STAFF APPRAISAL ‘41. The welcome rebound in economic activity in 1998 stands in contrast to tbe stagnation during the previous two years. The surge in growth owes much to the strong rebound in agricultural production following the weather-related setback in 1997, but the pick up in private investment may be indicative of an early response to the reform measures introduced in 1998, including the unification of most official exchange rates. Tight fiscal and wage policy helped cushion the adverse impact of the sharp drop in oil export prices in 1998. The authorities are to be commended for strengthening the collection of tax arrears and keeping expenditure growth at a moderate level, which helped contain the deterioration in the fiscal and current account positions. The continued downward trend in inflation is a welcome development in Syria, following several years of relatively high inflation rates. 42. The prospects for 1999 are diffkult due to the drought conditions, which once more underscore the vulnerability of the economy to weather fluctuations. As a result, growth is expected to decelerate and the fiscal and external current account positions are projected to deteriorate. The authorities have rightly moved to contain the drought-related effects, including, by rescheduling agricultural loan payments falling due and allowing for additional imports of animal feed. The deterioration in the fiscal accounts and the balance of payments is likely to be contained, however, due to higher oil export revenue and continued expenditure restraint. 43. While the financial imbalances in the economy are manageable, there is significant scope for reinvigorating growth to provide increased employment opportunities for a rapidly growing labor force and improve living standards. There is general consensus that the reform process must be broadened, but the pace of implementation must also be accelerated. In particular, early removal of the remaining distortions arising from price controls, subsidies, and trade restrictions could make a substantial contribution to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - accelerating medium-term growth. The progress that has been made in preparing amendments to the investment law is encouraging. The authorities should now move expeditiously to implement the revised law, but should also ensure that the new tax exemptions are offset by additional revenue-enhancing measures. In addition, complementary measures in other areas, including relaxing price controls and streamlining administrative procedures would reinforce the credibility of the authorities’ private sector development strategy. Moreover, the customs valuation exchange rates should be unified, the law that penalizes foreign exchange holdings by the private sector repealed, and the surrender requirement on export proceeds eliminated entirely. Simplification of the trade regime should be accelerated by reducing import restrictions to a single negative list in 1999, and then lowering import tariffs, and reducing the number and dispersion of tariff rates as soon as possible thereafter. 44. Full unification of the exchange regime is needed. The unification and depreciation of the official exchange rate in 1998 to a level closer to the free-market rate was an important step in simplifying the exchange rate regime and reducing impediments to private sector exports. While the gap between the official and parallel market rates has been narrowed significantly, the authorities should seize the opportunity of an environment of low inflation and a stable free-market exchange rate to fully unify the two rates through depreciation of the official rate during 1999. An early unification of the exchange rate and elimination of exchange restrictions would bolster investor confidence and reduce opportunities for rent- seeking behavior. This, together with tight fiscal and monetary policy would enhance Syria’s competitiveness and promote private sector exports. Over the medium-term, the development of a foreign exchange market in Syria would allow the adoption of a flexible exchange rate policy in order to protect competitiveness. 45. Fiscal consolidation efforts must be strengthened over the medium-term. This would be needed to offset the revenue loss stemming from the reduction in import duties under the Arab Free Trade Area and the prospective association with the European Union. Moreover, fiscal strengthening would also need to be geared toward introducing additional flexibility given the likely increase in expenditure on subsidies (in the absence of significant price adjustments) and in debt-service payments once Syria’s relations with external creditors are regularized. However, a superior alternative toward mobilizing additional revenue to pay for increased subsidies would be to eliminate or reduce the subsidies themselves and liberalize prices, thereby freeing the additional fiscal resources derived from tax reforms. A major step toward broadening the revenue base would be to introduce a sales tax at the manufacturing and import level, which could be transformed into a value added tax. At the same time, the corporate income tax would need to be revised to unify and lower the rates and reduce exemptions. As gains in tax administration efficiency and modemization are achieved, consideration could be given to introducing a general income tax. Containing the growth of government expenditure would require determined efforts to curb outlays on subsidies, which currently absorb 15 percent of total expenditure. While subsidies have helped contain nominal wage increases in addition to protecting vulnerable groups, a streamlined and better targeted system would still achieve the same social objectives at a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - lower budgetary cost. As noted above, reduction in subsidies could also contribute to growth through fiscal consolidation and an efficient allocation of resources. 46. A more diversified and competitive banking system would promote private sector development and foreign direct investment. The ongoing upgrading of the accounting and payments systems and the computerization and reorganization of the central bank and the COBS should set the stage for bolder financial sector reform measures, including providing banks with greater autonomy and promoting competition by allowing new banks to operate in the domestic market. Equally important is the need to provide the central bank with authority to conduct monetary policy and strengthen its capacity to carry out effective bank supervision. 47. Public enterprise reform should be strengthened. The launching of a pilot project of allowing four public enterprises greater autonomy is a major step toward reform, but must be followed by efforts to allow public enterprises to operate on a fully commercial basis. This would pave the way for allowing the private sector to operate in areas that are currently reserved for public enterprises, and subsequently to disengage government from a number of activities of a commercial nature. Accelerated implementation of such policies could make a substantial contribution to improving the efficiency of the Syrian economy. 48. Although Syria took significant steps during 1991-97 to regularize its external debt situation with bilateral creditors and the World Bank, little additional progress was made in 1998. Given the need to mobilize substantial long-term financial resources, including unlocking sizable financial assistance from the European Union, this process would need to be accelerated in the period ahead. 49. Some progress has been made in improving Syria’s statistical base, but major weaknesses remain. Efforts to strengthen the coverage, quality, and timeliness of economic and financial data and enhance its dissemination must cover a wide range of sectors, including national accounts, customs data on trade transactions, public finances, private capital movements, labor market data, and external debt statistics. The authorities are committed to bring about major improvements in this area as evidenced by the technical assistance they have received from the Fund and the European Union. High priority should be given to implementing the recommendations of the various technical assistance missions. These efforts could also be strengthened through participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System. 50.

The last consultation was held in February/March 1998 and was completed on June 15,1998. 0) The staff report for the 1998 Article IV consultation (SM/98/125) was issued on June 2, 1998. The Executive Boards decision (Decision No. 11740~(98/64)) was as follows: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the Syrian Arab Republic’s exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, and in concluding the 1998 Article XIV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic, in the light of the 1998 Article IV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted on April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in SM/98/125, the Syrian Arab Republic maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2. In addition, the Syrian Arab Republic maintains measures subject to approval under Article VIII. The Fund encourages the authorities to eliminate the restrictions maintained under Article XIV, Section 2 as soon as its balance of payments position permits, and urges the Syrian Arab republic to eliminate the measures that are subject to approval under Article VIII as soon as possible.

Syria had not paid debt service to the World Bank since 1986, except for intermittent monthly payments over a three-year period during 1992-95. By mid-1997 arrears had risen to the equivalent of US$526 million. Under the terms of the agreement, Syria repaid all of the principal arrears outstknding as of September 1, 1997 in the amount of US$270 million, and, starting October 1, 1997, has made monthly payments in the amount of US$6.1 million. The monthly payments at this level cover new debt service falling due and payment of interest arrears over a period of five years from October 1, 1997. As of April 13, 1999 the outstanding balance owed to the IBRD amounted to US$191.19 million. The amount of outstanding (but not yet due) principal amounted to the equivalent of US$69.04 million, of which the equivalent of US$32.28 million was to IDA and US$36.75 million for IBRD (as of March 31, 1999). Subsequent to the agreement on arrears, the World Bank has begun to provide non- lending services to Syria. The full scope and nature of the assistance program continues to be under discussion with the Syrian authorities. Initial activities include support for the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Syria in accounting and the establishment of an external debt management system in the form of grants from the Institutional Development Fund; planning and implementation grants supporting Year 2000 remediation efforts; the Global Environment Fund biodiversity project; and reviews of the trade regime (including export promotion), transportation, urban water, and sanitation sectors. At the same time, the IFC has begun to identify possible private sector projects for support through IFC equity investments or loans without government guarantee.

Real sector The Central Bureau of Statistics has made steady progress in implementing the recommenda- tions of the December 1995 STA national accounts statistics mission. The mission found that the aggregate estimates of GDP, compiled at current and constant prices by industry of origin and by final use, were based on a substantial database and an appropriate methodology. However, the mission also indicated several shortcomings. The production-based GDP estimates suffered from undercoverage of activities, particularly in trade and private services. In response, the authorities introduced a new industrial survey in 1997 which has a larger sampling of private sector activity. They also intended to implement a multipurpose services survey in 1998 that would focus on the trade sector. The STA mission also found that the estimates of final expenditures on GDP were incomplete in that household final consumption expenditures were calculated as a residual, and included changes in inventories since the latter was not estimated separately. In response, the authorities have begun to collect data on inventory changes in the public sector, and are considering whether a survey of inventories in the private sector is feasible. They had planned to use the results of a new household expenditure survey (see below) as a check on their estimates of final consumption expenditure. The other shortcomings identified by the STA mission have,not been able to be addressed as yet. These are that the consumption of fixed capital is estimated as a constant ratio of output, and that net income flows behveen residents and nonresidents derived from the balance of payments are unsatisfactory, so that the estimates of saving, investment, and net borrowing from abroad are unreliable. In addition, household final consumption expenditures should be estimated through a commodity flow analysis, and a new capital stock series should be developed. Beginning in 1995, the authorities have been preparing for the conversion of the national accounts to the methodology outlined in the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA). Two years’ data have been compiled, and the new series will be published when 5 years’ data are available. The major changes include the revision of the production and expenditure classifications; cotton ginning is moved from manufacturing to agriculture, repairs from personal services to wholesale trade, and expenditure on health and education from government collective consumption to individual consumption, Also, the new industry survey now covers some 20 categories of manufacturing activity rather than the 9 formerly. In 1999, the base year for national accounts data in constant prices was changed from 1985 to 1995. A new household expenditure survey was initiated in October 1996 and was completed in September 1997. The authorities were processing the survey results to introduce a new consumer price index in January 1999. The present retail price index (1990=100) is based on the 1985/86 household expenditure survey which does not reflect current consumption patterns. It is compiled monthly for each region in the country and is reported quarterly. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - APPENDIX IV wholesale price index (1990=100) is compiled and reported annually but is not representative as most prices are those of public sector enterprises. Submission of IFS real sector data to STA is irregular. b. Government finance Foreign financing as reported in the budgetary accounts cannot be confirmed by the balance of payments accounts. The accounting system of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) does not permit an accurate breakdown between interest and principal payments on domestic and foreign debt, and debt servicing is reported on a cash rather than an accrual basis. However, in 1997 the Central Bank initiated the process of separating interest and amortization payments on external debt with the cooperation of the MOF and the State Planning Commission. With regard to net credit to Government, there are sizable discrepancies between the monetary survey and the fiscal accounts. The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear, even after making allowance for the Ministry of Finance’s classifying commercial bank credit extended to the Price Stabilization Fund outside the budget. However, they probably include differences in coverage and timing and differences between cash and accrual. Similarly, the Central Bank of Syria (CeBS) occasionally assumes the accumulated debt of public enterprises to the banking system through the issuance of government bonds; such operations are not reflected in the fiscal or monetary accounts. Moreover, coverage includes only some extrabudgetary units and there is a need for reclassification of some tax revenue items to nontax revenues. Syria regularly reports GFS annual data for publication in the GFS Yearbook. However, the reported data are partial, too aggregated, misclassified (for some revenue component items) and do not include extrabudgetary and social security accounts. No data on financing and debt are provided; there is no breakdown for current and capital expenditure, and lending minus repayments is reported as zero. Syria does not report GFS data for publication in IFS. C. Monetary accounts The CeBS has made considerable progress in implementing the recommendations of the April 1996 STAMED technical assistance mission. All sectorization, classification, and valuation errors in the monetary statistics that were identified by the mission have been corrected. Reporting lags also have been reduced significantly. The preliminary balance sheet of the CeBS is now available with only a three-month lag, and is estimated by the CeBS’s Research Department by drawing on the reports of operational departments and holding at constant value entries for which data are not available. The final CeBS balance sheet is now available with a six-month lag. These final data are reported to STA for IFS publication. Similarly, a preliminary consolidated commercial banks’ balance sheet is available with a three-month lag and the final balance sheet with a six-month lag. The April 1996 mission recommended that the authorities reconcile CeBS and Ministry of Finance data on the financing of the government deficit by the domestic banking system (see above), and the authorities have now agreed to begin this task. Another difficulty remains with the accounting of foreign exchange reserves, which are booked by the CeBS in Syrian pounds, at Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-41- APPENDIX TV the exchange rate in effect at the time of the underlying transaction. These underlying transactions have not been made available to the staff; consequently there can be no confirmation of the official valuation of Syria’s international reserves. The Commercial Bank of Syria continues to book foreign exchange at the 1995 exchange rate in neighboring countries of LS42 = US$l, ignoring the devaluations that have since taken place. In addition, effective April 1, 1999, the Post Office Savings Fund (POSF) was authorized to begin lending activities. Therefore, it has effectively become a bank and should be included in the monetary survey. However, the CeBS is unable to do so until the status of the POSF has been changed by legislation, which is being prepared. d. Balance of payments The January 1996 STA technical assistance mission found that balance of payments data suffer from incomplete coverage and valuation problems arising from the presence of multiple exchange rates. At that time the current account data did not include re-exports and temporary imports; this has now been corrected. In 1997, the CBS also began to collect data on foreign transactions by the communications and postal authorities to improve the estimates of government and other services. However, military imports are still excluded from the balance of payments, and private transfers do not fully reflect remittances by Syrians working abroad. Estimates of travel, including both credit and debit, could also be improved. In addition, the statistics in the balance of payments for official transfers differ significantly from figures provided from other sources such as donors, and data on long-term capital inflows and amortization are not consistent with the data provided by the Ministry of Finance on the external financing of the budget deficit. Data on external debt continue to be incomplete and exclude military debt. External debt service obligations and arrears are not recorded in the balance of payments statistics. Coverage deficiencies also include incomplete data on private capital movements. Trade data are compiled monthly by the Customs Department and reported quarterly by the Central Bureau of Statistics with a 6-month lag. The balance of payments is compiled annually on a provisional basis with about an S-month lag. The 1996 technical assistance mission recommended that the CBS assign more staff to balance of payments compilation, undertake surveys to improve the coverage of a number of services and financial account items, develop closer liaison with various government agencies for the provision of balance of payments data, and that the balance of payments be compiled according to BMP5 methodology; this methodology was implemented beginning with 1996 data. However, staffing constraints within the CBS have not permitted additional resources to be directed to the balance of payments work, so that the compilation lag is unlikely to be reduced in the near future. 2.

Consequently, private investment (excluding gas sector investment) is assumed to recover slowly from the low level of 9 percent of GDP in 1997; including gas investments it would average only 14 percent of GDP in 2003-04 compared with 17 percent in 1994. The volume of private sector exports would increase by only 4% percent per year over the projection period. Private savings would recover slowly from the low of 14 percent of GDP in 1998, reaching 16 percent of GDP in 2004 because of the slow pace of implemetation of financial reforms that would boost financial intermediation. Nonetheless, national private savings would still exceed gross private investment throughout the period. The slow recovery of oil prices, the absence of significant price adjustments for subsidized goods, and the lack of a major domestic revenue mobihzation initiative (a general sales or value added tax) would constrain budgetary current and development expenditures. Only new gas-related revenues would enable public investment to be maintained at 12 percent of GDP during 2000-2004. Public saving would recover marginally from the low level of 7% percent of GDP projected for 1999-2000 to 8% percent by 2003-04 when the overall fiscal deficit would stabilize at 3% percent of GDP. The modest improvement in the fiscal position would enable inflation to be contained at about 4% percent per year. The slow growth of private investment would limit the growth of productivity so that real GDP would average about 4 percent per year over the projection period. This would be insufficient to prevent higher unemployment if the population continues to increase at the current rate of 3.3 percent per year. Nonetheless, the balance of payments would not come under pressure. The external current account deficit would average 2.9 percent of GDP over 1999-2001 including gas project- related imports and 2.3 percent excluding such imports. After the project comes on-stream in 2002, the current account deficit would average 1.8 percent of GDP over 2002-04. This deficit could easily be financed by capital inflows from existing sources-regional countries and multilateral institutions-and new sources such as the EIB and IFC. Gross official reserves would be maintained at the equivalent of 5 months’ imports and the external debt to GDP ratio would remain stable at about 28 percent, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicSyrian Arab Republic: Macroeconomic Framework, 1994-2004 1994 1995 1996 1997 Est.
