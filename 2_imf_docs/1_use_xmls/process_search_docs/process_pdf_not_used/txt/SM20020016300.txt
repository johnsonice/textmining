Indicators point to a decline in real GDP by 2-3 percent in 2002. The weakening of tourism demand combined with a decline in private transfers ;ed to a widening of the external current account deficit to 33 percent of GDP in 2001. The deficit was financed by official commercial loans and direct investment, mostly in real estate and tourist-related construction. a In response to the slowdown in fiscal revenues following the September attacks, the authorities reduced expenditure sharply, and the overall central government deficit narrowed to 12% percent of GDP in 2001. The large deficits in recent years, combined with the losses of the sugar industry (3 percent of GDP a year) have led to a sharp rise in the public debt, which stood at 122 percent of GDP at end-2001. l The main challenges facing St. Kitts and Nevis are to implement promptly policies to address the fiscal imbalance and the buildup of debt, and to set the stage for satisfactory rates of economic growth over the medium term. Real GDP is expected to recover by 4-5 percent in 2003-04, based mainly on the anticipated upturn in tourism following the opening in late-2002 of a new tourist resort that will raise hotel capacity by 50 percent. a While the government expressed determination to persevere with fiscal consolidation, the staff encouraged adoption of a broad set of reforms that will be required to achieve the medium term goals. The authorities’ main fiscal goals are to reduce the central government deficit to 8% percent of GDP in 2002, and achieve a small overall surplus by 2005. The government has taken important steps toward achieving the 2002 target, including strengthening tax administration, containing the growth of wages, and tightening procurement procedures. Achieving the medium term fiscal goals will also require a broadening of the tax base, the introduction of an excise tax, cuts in transfers to weak enterprises, and more rigorous criteria for capital projects. In addition, it will be essential to adopt promptly a strategy to halt the persistent losses of the state sugar industry, and introduce tighter financial control over the other public enterprises. a The government’s agenda for reform focuses on enhancing competitiveness by modernizing the civil service and expanding training opportunities for school leavers. In the financial system, the priorities are to strengthen the National Bank, implement the recommendations on regulating the offshore sector that arose from the recent Module I self- assessment, and strengthen enforcement of the anti-money laundering laws.

Discussions for the 2002 Article IV consultation were held in St. Kitts and Nevis during the period February 14-27.l The mission met with the Prime Minister, who is also minister of finance, the Premier of Nevis, the Financial Secretary, the governor of the central bank, and senior officials, as well as with representatives of the private sector, the labor unions, and the political opposition.2 Mr. Vermaeten, Advisor to the Executive Director for St, Kitts and Nevis, participated in the final round of discussions. 2. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on October 23,200O (EBM/00/103). Directors noted the weakening of economic activity and the public sector finances in recent years that resulted mainly from the adverse effects of a series of hurricanes in 1998-99, and the steady output decline in the sugar sector. They welcomed the initial steps taken to halt the rapid buildup of debt, and emphasized the need to curtail spending and formulate a lasting solution to address the losses of the state-owned sugar company. Directors urged the authorities to step up efforts to enhance supervision of the offshore sector, combat money laundering, and investigate financial crimes. Also, they stressed the importance of structural reforms---especially in the areas of the civil service, the tax system, and skills training-to help ensure a sustainable fiscal position and preserve competitiveness.3 3. The authorities’ provision of core statistical data to the Fund has improved since the last consultation. In particular, detailed information on the central government finances and the banking system is available on a regular and timely basis. However, weaknesses in the timeliness and coverage of other data, including the expenditure composition of the national accounts, the finances of the public enterprises, and private debt and capital flows, hamper the effective monitoring of economic developments (see Appendix IV). i The mission comprised Messrs. DaCosta (head), Njoroge, Piris, and Rizavi (all WHD). Ms. Jeffers of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and Mr. Harris of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) contributed to the mission’s work and participated in the discussions. 2 St. Kitts and Nevis form a twin-island federation in the eastern Caribbean, with a land area of 269 square kilometers, a population of 45,900, and an average income of US$7,500 per person. The economy is based on tourism and other services, sugar, and light manufacturing. 3 St. Kitts and Nevis is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). Its relations with the Fund and exchange arrangement are summarized in Appendix I. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- II. BACKGROUNDANDRECENTDEVELOPMENTS 4. Following the widespread damage caused by hurricanes in 1998-99, real GDP rose sharply in 2000, reflecting an increase in domestic demand that stemmed from spending by the government and the tourism industry on post-hurricane repair and reconstruction,4 as well as strong growth in exports of electronic components. Economic activity continued to be robust in the first three quarters of 2001, based on construction; a rebound in tourist arrivals as the major hotels reopened; and an increase in sugar production, mainly due to higher yields.5 However, following the September 11 attacks, the number of stayover tourists fell sharply; activity in tourism-dependent sectors, particularly road transportation and retail sales declined; and exports to the U.S. were virtually halted. As a result, real GDP growth slowed to just below 2 percent for 2001 as a whole (Table 1 and Figure 1). 5. Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2002 indicate that economic activity continued to be weak. There were indications of a pick up in stayover arrivals. However, the demand for exports (mainly electronic components) in the U.S. market remained depressed. The only sector with some buoyancy appeared to be construction-led by the ongoing work on the 900-room tourism resort that is financed by Canadian investors.6 No current information is available on the employment situation, but hours worked in the tourism and electronic assembly continued to decline, while inflation remained at 2-3 percent. 6. Notwithstanding the surge in reconstruction-related imports, the external current account deficit narrowed to 17% percent of GDP in 2000 (23 percent in 1999) owing to a sharp increase in private transfers that represented mainly the settlement of hurricane-related insurance claims. The external current account deficit widened to 33 percent of GDP in 2001, reflecting a weakening of tourism demand and exports, and a decline in private transfers as the payment of hurricane-related insurance claims ceased. The deficits in recent years have been financed by commercial borrowing by the government and direct investment, mostly in real estate and the tourism sectora In addition, there have been significant swings in private capital flows and errors and omissions. 4 The three hurricanes in 1998-99 caused significant damage to hotels, the sugarcane crop, schools, and the main hospital. The cost of the damage from the 1998 hurricane alone was cstimatcd at about USS300 million, or in excess of GDP. 5 Most of the sugar is exported to the United Kingdom under a preferential quota. 6 The cost of the project is estimated at about US$200 million, or almost 60 percent of GDP. 7 As in other eastern Caribbean countries, in recent years the external current account deficits in St. Kitts and Nevis have fluctuated considerably because of the large import component of investment-reflecting the narrow economic base-and the fluctuations in imports that are (continued) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- 7. The central government finances weakened in 1999-2000, as the growth of expenditure-mainly on the wage bi11,8 interest, and capital projects-combined with reduced revenue buoyancy, that stemmed, in part, from increased tax exemptions to tourism and manufacturing companies in the wake of the hurricanes. These factors, together with the rapid growth in spending on reconstruction, led to a widening of the overall deficit of the central government from 6 percent of GDP in 1998 to 14% percent in 2000’ (Tables 2-3). 8. Fiscal performance began to improve in 2001. Revenue in the first three quarters rose by 9 percent relative to the same period in 2000, owing to increases in tax rates (on the consumption tax, the customs service charge, and the social security levy) and the upturn in tourist arrivals, while the growth in spending was limited to 4 percent. In response to the weakening of fiscal revenues following the September attacks, the authorities cut spending sharply in the fourth quarter.” In particular, the end-year bonus to civil servants (equivalent to 1 percent of GDP) was not paid, and outlays on capital projects and goods and services fell sharply. As a result, the overall deficit narrowed to 12l% percent of GDP in 2001, financed mainly by regional commercial banks. Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2002 indicate that government revenue increased by about ‘/z of one percentage point of GDP, relative to the same period in 2001, owing to the stepped-up assessment and enforcement efforts. 9. In the rest of the public sector, the sugar company’s annual deficits over the past 2-3 years have remained at about 3% percent of GDP, as rising production and debt service costs have been accompanied by declining revenues. The deficits have been financed by the National Bank, in which the government owns the majority of shares (Appendix V). Very little information is available on the other public enterprises, except that their debt outstanding (comprising mainly external loans for housing construction and the repair of the port) remained virtually unchanged at about 15 percent of GDP in 2000-O 1. l1 The Social Security Board (SSB) registered annual surpluses equivalent to 5 percent of GDP in recent years, most of which were deposited at the National Bank. based on the swings in tourism investment and responses to exogenous shocks, such as hurricanes. ’ The wage bill rose by an average of 1 I percent a year during the 1998-2000 period, with the number of permanent civil service staff increasing by an average rate of 5 percent a year. 9 Total expenditure rose by a cumulative 7 percentage points of GDP in 1999-2000. lo Tax revenues in the fourth quarter were 15 percent lower than the same period in 2000, with taxes on international trade and transactions registering the largest decline. I1 Of the main enterprises, the Port Authority appears viable, while others-responsible mainly for housing and tourism development-are financially weak and depend on transfers from the government totaling about 1 percent of GDP a year.

The central government deficits and the losses of the sugar company have led to a sharp increase in the public debt, from 86 percent of GDP at end-1998 to 122 percent at end-200 1. Over the same period, the central government debt rose from 6 1 percent of GDP to 88 percent, while that of the sugar company increased from 12 percent of GDP to 19 percent. l2 11. Although broad money growth slowed in 2001, the commercial banks’ liquidity position continued to increase, owing to the government’s refinancing of part of its bank debt with external loans, and a decline in private sector credit (Table 4). Despite these factors, the reduction in international interest rates, and a lowering of the discount rate by the ECCB in October, domestic interest rates remained unchanged in 200 1, with the average lending rate at 11.2 percent, and the average deposit rate at 4.3 percent. Developments in the banking system in the first quarter of 2002 mirrored those in the economy as a whole, with a further decline in private sector credit, and a continued buildup in banking system liquidity. 12. Measured for St. Kitts and Nevis, the index of the CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by about 2 percent a year since 1998. The appreciation was broadly in line with that of its main competitors in the Caribbean region (Figure 2), and reflected the movement of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies. The absence of reliable data on other prices and wages precludes the construction of alternative measures of competitiveness. 13. The authorities are pressing ahead with reforms in the public sector and the financial system. During 200 1 emphasis was placed on upgrading the skills of civil servants, and on setting up a Public Sector Reform Unit in which all civil service reform efforts are centralized. Also, the liberalization of the telecommunications sector began with the breakup of the monopoly on domestic cellular services. In the offshore sector, a Financial Services Commission and a Financial Intelligence Unit have been established; legislation now permits the sharing of information with other jurisdictions, and criminalizes the laundering of proceeds from all crimes; and the Module I self-assessment conducted with the assistance of the Fund and the ECCB has been completed. St. Kitts and Nevis remains on the FATF list of weak jurisdictions regarding offshore tinancial sector supervision and anti-money laundering efforts, but was removed from the OECD’s list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions in March 2002. The country’s inclusion in the FATF list will be reviewed at the organization’s next meeting in June 2002. On the domestic front, the Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange (ECSE), a regional market in corporate securities, based at the central bank in St. Kitts, began operations in January 2002. Trading on the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM)- a market for government paper-is expected to commence later this year. l2 These figures (which are larger than previous estimates) are based on the recent work of the Ministry of Finance, ECCB, and the Fund staff aimed at capturing more comprehensively the debt of the public enterprises.

The discussions focused on policies to address St. Kitts and Nevis’ fiscal imbalance and structural weaknesses, and set the stage for satisfactory rates of economic growth over the medium term. The authorities recognized that a recovery would not be sustained in the face of continued large fiscal deficits, and indicated that their priorities were to take the steps needed to reduce the deficit in 2002, and reverse the buildup of debt. Other priorities included correcting the structural problems in the public sector-in particular, the growth in the civil service wage bill, the losses of the sugar industry, and the inadequate accountability in the rest of the public enterprises. Also, in view of the importance for the currency union’s growth and fiscal stability of a robust financial sector and efficient financial markets, it was essential that the banking system remained sound and well regulated. ’ 3 A. Policies to Promote Investment and Growth 1.5. The authorities were bullish about the near- to medium- term prospects for private investment, job creation, and growth. Much of their optimism is based on the new tourist resort, expected to begin operations in November 2002, which will increase hotel capacity by 50 percent, provide about 2,000 new jobs, attract additional airline capacity, and help boost tourist-related services, such as transportation, communications, and retail sales. Tourism and export expansion would be supported also by a sharp increase in cruise visitors following the ongoing reconstruction of the cruiseship pier, a moderate recovery in exports of electronic components to the U.S. market, and the establishment of call centers that are anticipated in the wake of the liberalization of the telecommunications sector. 16. Based on these factors, and following a decline by 2-3 percent in 2002, real GDP growth is projected to reach 4-5 percent in 2003-04, and stabilize at about 3% percent a year in 2005-06. Inflation would remain in the 2-3 percent range, while the external current account deficit would decline gradually-reaching 17 percent of GDP by 2006 (Tables 5-6). 17. The main policy related risks to these growth prospects are (i) delays by the government in addressing the weak fiscal situation, which could result in the continued growth in debt; (ii) the postponement of the measures needed to address the main structural impediments to growth; and (iii) the emergence of shortages of skilled labor in tourism and related sectors. Exogenous shocks, such as the constant threat of damage to the country’s infrastructure and tourism plant due to hurricanes, will also continue to pose a risk. l3 Recent developments, institutional arrangements, and policy issues in the currency union will be addressed in the forthcoming surveillance work on the ECCU that is expected to begin later this year.

Officials emphasized that the widening of the fiscal imbalances in recent years should not be viewed as reflecting any weakening of their resolve to achieve the longstanding objective of eliminating the central government deficit. They noted that the current fiscal weakness originated mainly from the efforts to repair hurricane-damaged infrastructure that was essential for the key tourism industry, as well as from the structural weaknesses in the sugar industry. 19. With the repair work largely completed, the authorities-working closely with the central bank, the CDB, as well as with Fund and World Bank staff-have begun to take the steps needed to meet the government’s fiscal targets. The key targets are to (i) reduce the central government deficit by 4 percentage points to 8% percent of GDP in 2002; (ii) achieve a small overall surplus and government saving of about 5 % percent of GDP by 2005; and (iii) reduce the central government debt from 97 percent of GDP in 2002 to 76 percent by 2006. l4 These objectives are consistent with medium term fiscal and debt sustainability, and are in line with the fiscal goals discussed at the time of the last Article IV consultation. The fiscal targets are also broadly consistent with those being considered for the currency union. l5 The staff noted that failure to achieve these targets would lead to a further buildup of debt (to in excess of 150 percent of GDP), an erosion of creditworthiness, and a loss of confidence in the country’s fiscal management. 20. To date, the main measures taken by the government in 2002 have focused on strengthening tax administration and enforcement, and exercising tighter control over the wage bill and government procurement. As noted, the first quarter data show that revenue collection-particularly the corporate income tax-has improved. Also, the granting of ad hoc tax exemptions has been reduced. On expenditure, the annual bonus to civil servants was cancelled for the second consecutive year; a freeze on hiring has been instituted; the growth of the civil service is being contained through attrition and by renewing the contracts of temporary workers only for essential activities; and the wage registers of the main spending ministries are being audited. In addition, new procedures are being introduced that require the pre-authorization by the Ministry of Finance of all large purchases or contracts in excess of EC$2,000 (US$740), and capital projects are being reviewed, with the aim of cutting spending by the equivalent of 2 percentage points of GDP. Staff stressed that the deficit target for 2002 would be achieved only if the authorities sustained full l4 Over the same period, the total public and publicly-guaranteed debt would be reduced from 144 percent of GDP to 89 percent, assuming the repayment of the sugar company loans through the sale of sugar lands by end-2003 (see Table 6). l5 The Monetary Council of the ECCB is developing proposals on fiscal targets for the region that are broadly in line with those of St. Kitts and Nevis. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- implementation of these measures throughout the year. In particular, it would be important to maintain the government’s resolve to reduce the wage bill, in view of indications that employment in the civil service increased slightly in the first two months of 2002. 21. Staff observed that additional actions were needed to ensure achievement of the medium term fiscal targets. Its suggestions on the revenue side focused on (i) strengthening the legal framework to address the remaining loopholes in tax assessment, collection, and penalties; (ii) replacing the specific tax on alcohol, tobacco, and fuels with an ad valorem excise tax; (iii) updating the property register and property valuations to ensure an adequate base for the property tax collections; (iv) monitoring closely existing tax exemptions, with a view to eliminating those which are no longer warranted; l6 and (v) adjusting electricity tariffs to bring them in line with generating costs, as in neighboring countries.17 Officials indicated that draft legislation needed to strengthen the legal framework had been prepared, and was awaiting approval by parliament. Also, progress had been made in updating the property register, and reviewing tax exemptions. They planned to continue to press for an intensification of the exploratory work on a possible uniform sales or VAT-type tax across the currency union. 22. On expenditure, the staff suggested that the government’s efforts to limit the growth in the wage bill could be strengthened by setting targets for reducing the number of staff; moving away from the automatic pay increases to civil servants; and working with the labor unions to introduce a pay system in line with performance. Also, it would be important to end the practice of allowing unbudgeted “below the line “expenditure, which is brought on to the budget only after long lags; cut back government support to enterprises which are not fully accountable; and introduce more rigorous criteria for the inclusion of projects into the government’s capital projects list. 23. The discussions on the rest of the public sector focused on three main issues: addressing the losses of the sugar industry, the need for greater accountability by the other state enterprises, and steps to ensure the viability of the social security system. The authorities acknowledged that the fiscal situation would continue to exhibit fragility because of the sugar industry losses. l8 Several proposals on the future of the sugar industry had been made in recent years, many of which recommended its closure on efficiency and financial grounds (see Appendix V). Officials noted that the sugar industry, though weak, l6 Among other ECCU countries, Grenada has been able to boost customs revenues in 2002 by reducing the magnitude of the exemptions granted to certain large private institutions. Recently, the Prime Minister of St. Lucia urged a re-appraisal of all tax exemptions in the currency union. l7 The water and electricity utilities are departments of the central government. I8 About half of these losses stem from the reaping and sugar manufacturing operations, the remainder reflects the interest on the company’s debt. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- was still an important pillar of the country’s economic and social structure, accounting for about 7 percent of employment. As a result, although there appeared to be a growing public consensus in favor of closing the industry, the government was not prepared to take a decision on closure until a clear strategy for the alternative use of the sugar lands had been determined, and a social safety net for displaced sugar workers established. Currently, the FAO is carrying out a study of alternative uses for the sugar lands that is expected to be completed by mid-year, however, the government has made no firm proposals on the nature or financing of a social safety net. The staff urged the authorities to move speedily on these two fronts, and to establish a timetable for the industry’s closure.” 24. Regarding the other public enterprises, key risks to fiscal sustainability stem from the size of their debt (projected to reach 24 percent of GDP by end-2002), the inability of some enterprises to service their debt, and their involvement in quasi-fiscal activities, such as low-cost housing. Staff expressed concern also that adequate fiscal policy management would remain elusive, as long as most public enterprises and boards failed to report to the ministry of finance or to the public, through Parliament, as required under existing rules. To address these concerns, the mission recommended that the authorities conduct a thorough assessment of the finances of the public enterprises. Based on the assessments, the government should decide on a strategy for the enterprises that would involve decisions on winding up operations, mergers, and privatization-especially for those weak enterprises involved in housing and tourism development. 25. Based on the actuarial report that was issued by the IL0 in 2000, the social security system is sound. However, the report contained a number of recommendations aimed at ensuring a strong long term position, which are being considered by the government. In particular, it is important to set a firm timetable for actions to reduce the excessive concentration of the Board’s assets ($270 million, equivalent to 40 percent of total deposits) at the National Bank, and the heavy SSB lending to public enterprises and other bodies, which at end-2001 was equivalent to about 12 percent of GDP. Staff suggested that l9 The main effects of the closure of the sugar industry are likely to be on employment (the industry employs about 1,000 people), but many workers are close to retirement age, and others will likely find employment opportunities in tourism and construction. The industry’s contribution to GDP is small (less than 1 percent of GDP), hence the effects of closure on output are not likely to be significant. In net terms, the fiscal effects of closure are likely to be positive. The industry pays no taxes, and will require government transfers in 2003 and beyond. With respect to the balance of payments effects, sugar exports constitute about 1 percent of GDP, and the effects of a closure of the industry are likely to be offset, beginning in 2003, by the marked increase in tourism receipts following the opening of the new tourist resort.

Monetary and Financial Sector Policies 26. Monetary and exchange rate policy in the ECCU is conducted by the common central bank. Bank officials reaffirmed that the main policy objective is to maintain the fixed peg to the U.S. dollar.2’ Strict limits on borrowing from the central bank by banks and governments ensure that the high foreign exchange cover is maintained. Within this framework, liquidity shortages/surpluses in one member country are met by borrowing from/lending to other countries largely through the branch banking network of the large Canadian and U.K banks that dominate the financial system, without the need for intervention by the central bank. Domestic interest rates are therefore determined by domestic as well as ECCU-wide liquidity conditions. 27. Based on indicators compiled by the ECCB, the overall financial condition of the banking system appears sound. In late 2001, the National Bank completed a share issue aimed at strengthening its capital, and broadening its ownership base.22 Staff suggested that the bank withdraw gradually from its role as a lender of last resort to the public sector, reduce its reliance on deposits of the Social Security Board, and seek an assessment of its finances by an independent agency. Such an assessment-perhaps in the framework of an exercise covering all locally-owned banks in the ECCU-would be useful in the context of efforts by the central bank to integrate the financial systems- within the currency union, develop a region-wide interbank market, and launch the regional securities market-all of which would require greater transparency and financial disclosure. 28. The authorities expressed their commitment to continued efforts aimed at bringing the regulatory framework for offshore finance in line with international standards. The staff suggested that an action plan be finalized promptly-based on the recommendations of MAE-aimed at securing St. Kitts and Nevis’ removal from the list of non-cooperative jurisdictions in June 2002. The recommendations included strengthening the capacity of the Financial Services Commission, consolidating supervision of holding companies with onshore and offshore subsidiaries, improving record keeping requirements for companies and trust services providers, and providing information on the beneficial ownership of trusts and international business companies. Regarding anti-money laundering 2o Currently, about two percent of the Board’s assets are invested outside the country, 21 At end-April 2002, the bank’s international reserves were equivalent to 96 percent of its demand liabilities (mainly currency and bank deposits). 22 The issue was oversubscribed by 20 percent, and the number of individual shareholders more than doubled to 2,738. Following the share issue, the government’s shareholding declined from 60 percent to 5 1 percent of the bank’s authorized capital.

D. Medium-Term Balance of Payments and External Policies 29. The authorities said that, in their view, the widening of the external current account deficit in 2001, and its size over the medium term (about 18 percent of GDP) was not a cause for concern. The deficits reflected imports associated with the significant new investment in tourist facilities as well as public infrastructure projects, and were financed mainly by inflows of private direct investment, official grants, and government borrowing. The medium term scenario envisaged that (i) the volume growth rate of merchandise exports would stabilize at about 5-6 percent owing to a moderate pickup in demand for electronic components; (ii) tourist receipts would increase sharply in 2003-04 following the opening of the new tourism resort; and (iii) the growth rate of merchandise imports would decline in 2003 in line with the completion of the major tourism and infrastructure projects. The mission shared the assessment that, on this basis, the external current account deficit would decline gradually from the projected 33 percent of GDP in 2002 to 17 percent of GDP in 2006. 30. St. Kitts and Nevis’ trade policies are largely determined in the context of the country’s membership in the OECS and CARICOM. A recent review by the WTO on trade policies in the OECS region indicated that ECCU member countries are moving toward a more liberal trade regime, but are constrained by a shortage of human resources and institutional weaknesses. With the implementation of the final phase of import tariff reductions under CARICOM’s common external tariff agreement, average tariffs have been reduced to 16 percent,23 the same level as in other OECS member countries. Together with the other countries of the Caribbean region, St. Kitts and Nevis is participating in discussions aimed at creating a single market within CARICOM,24 and a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). 31. Government and central bank officials noted that the currency union’s exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar had played a key role in maintaining low inflation and investor confidence. Staff shared this view, but emphasized that preserving the peg required a strengthening of the fiscal position throughout the currency union, a decline in the high debt burdens in some member countries, including St. Kitts and Nevis, and a sound financial system. It was important also that wages and other key costs remained competitive, and efforts to increase productivity continued through reforms of the public sector, and additional investment in education and training. The authorities concurred, but saw no immediate 23 The average tariff on consumer goods is 20 percent, while that on capital and intermediate goods is 5 percent. 24 A major study on the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (SME) is scheduled to be completed by the CDB and the CARICOM Secretariat during 2002.

E. Structural Reforms 32. The agenda for structural reform focuses on the civil service, and ensuring that the labor force is adequately trained so as to take advantage of the new opportunities being created in the tourism, telecommunications, and related sectors. Regarding the civil service, the newly-established Public Sector Reform Secretariat has just begun work on assessing staffing, the cost of services, and operating guidelines. The staff welcomed this initiative, stressing that a major result of the exercise should be the development of proposals to de-emphasize automatic bonuses and other pay increases in the civil service, and shift to a more differentiated, performance-based pay system, as part of a strategy to attract and retain skilled staff. Consideration should also be given to reducing the scope of government, for example through the conversion of the electricity and water utilities from government departments into profitable, independent agencies. 33. The government has embarked on a number of initiatives to enhance education and training opportunities. Emphasis is now being placed on offering basic technological skills to students throughout the country-beginning in the elementary schools. Demand for such skills is expanding in the light manufacturing, data entry, and call center industries. Also, the authorities are considering setting up a hospitality training center to prepare high school graduates for entry-level careers in the rapidly expanding tourism sector. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 34. Over the past 3-4 years St. Ritts and Nevis’ economy has experienced a number of serious challenges, including natural disasters, increasing financial weakness in the sugar industry, and the effects of the September 11 attacks. The authorities have responded quickly to these challenges. Damaged infrastructure has been repaired, hotels have been refurbished, and St. Kitts and Nevis has been able to attract considerable new investment in tourism that will permit a rapid economic recovery, beginning in 2003. These efforts, however, have contributed to a deterioration of the fiscal position and a sharp increase in the public sector debt. Other factors also contributing to the widening fiscal deficits have been the rapid growth in the wage bill, goods and services, and transfers to weak public enterprises, as well as the steady erosion of the tax base caused by the wide range of tax exemptions to tourism, manufacturing, and other activities. 35. The authorities have indicated their determination to reduce the fiscal imbalance in 2002, as a first step toward eliminating these deficits by 200506. Achieving this objective, as well as maintaining adequate spending on infrastructure and social priorities, and reducing the debt will require significant improvements in government saving. The staff welcomes the government’s actions thus far, including the enhancing of tax administration, the tightening of wage and hiring policies, and the strengthening of government procurement rules. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- 34. Meeting the authorities’ goals, however, will require additional measures, and it will be vital to ensure that the expected economic recovery in 2003 does not detract from the urgency of fiscal correction, or lead to complacency. On the revenue side, it will be important to obtain early approval of draft legislation that would help close the remaining loopholes in tax assessment, collection, and penalties; introduce an ad valorem excise tax on alcohol, tobacco, and fuel; continue the work on updating the property register and property valuations; and take steps to reduce tax exemptions. On expenditure, the priorities are to reduce the size of the wage bill, enforce strictly the new procurement rules, and limit capital spending to those projects that are essential for infrastructure and social priorities. 37. In the rest of the public sector, the main risks to ensuring fiscal soundness comprise the large and persistent losses of the sugar industry and the inadequate accountability of the other state enterprises. The staff urges the authorities to take a decision promptly, aimed at eliminating the losses of the sugar company, including through the possible closure of the company. In this context, it would be important that plans for alternative uses of the sugar lands and an adequate safety net for displaced sugar workers be completed shortly. In addition to its effect in enhancing fiscal sustainability, a decision to eliminate the losses of the sugar industry would ease pressure on the National Bank. 38. It is essential that the authorities undertake as soon as possible a comprehensive assessment of the financial condition of the other public enterprises through audits, their contracting of debt be subject to effective ministry of finance review, and the reporting on their finances to Parliament be strictly enforced. The audits could serve as a basis for determining the government’s strategy for the enterprises, including privatization-with the proceeds used to pay down the debt. In this context, the staff recommends that the authorities move with urgency to ensure no new borrowing by the 4-5 weak enterprises involved in land, housing, and tourism development, and to consolidate their operations into a single government agency. Fiscal soundness would also require strengthening the actuarial position of the Social Security Board by diversifying the Board’s investment policies away from the weak public enterprises and the National Bank. 39. The main priority in the financial sector is to ensure the soundness of the domestic banking system. The staff welcomes the recent, successful share issue by the National Bank that helped strengthen its capital, while broadening its ownership. Given the position of the bank as the largest locally owned financial institution in the currency union, it is essential that these efforts continue, and the staff recommends that the government take steps to phase out the bank’s role as the main source of finance to the public sector, and reduce its reliance on the social security scheme for funding. In the staffs view, an independent assessment of the bank-as part of a broader evaluation of all the locally-owned banks in the currency union-would be useful as part of the efforts by the central bank to integrate and strengthen the regional financial markets. 40. In the offshore sector, it is essential that the authorities develop and implement quickly (with technical assistance from the Fund or CARTAC, if needed) an action plan to address the recommendations arising out of the recent Module I self-assessment. Attention is most urgently required to the staffing of the Financial Services Commission, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- consolidated supervision, improved record keeping by companies and trust services providers, and information sharing . In the area of anti-money laundering efforts and the combating of the financing of terrorism, emphasis should be placed on the strengthening of enforcement. 41. Prospects for growth are favorable, and the staff commends the success of the government in attracting significant flows of private investment. The staff shares the view that the exchange rate peg has played a vital role in helping maintain price stability, relatively good labor relations, and investor confidence in St. Kitts and Nevis. However, in an increasingly complex external environment, the risks to the peg should not be underestimated. Preserving it will require from St. Kitts and Nevis and other member countries a sustained strengthening of the fiscal position and prospects, a decline in the debt, a sound, well-regulated financial sector, and early progress in reforming the public sector and increasing labor productivity. 42. The financing of the external current account does not appear to be a cause for concern at this time. However, it would be important for the authorities to work with the ECCB on assessing more thoroughly private capital inflows, and in particular, their implications for private debt, which is not being monitored closely. The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to address these issues, and notes the possibility of technical assistance from CARTAC in this area. 43. While the statistical base has improved in recent years, weaknesses remain that adversely affect the quality of economic analysis, particularly in the areas of the finances of public enterprises and agencies, and labor statistics. The staff urges the authorities to seek technical assistance to improve the reliability and timeliness of these data, and to ensure that the statistics office is provided with adequate staffing and other resources. 44. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard 12-month cycle.

PROJECTS There are three active World Bank projects in St. Kitts and Nevis for a net commitment of approximately US$l3 million equivalent. On March 7, 2002, the Board approved an Emergency Recovery Project to St. Kitts and Nevis in the amount of US$4.4 million, which was signed in April 2002. These projects are part of the OECS sub-regional program of the World Bank. The OECS Solid Waste/Ship Generated Waste Management Project, approved in FY95, aims to reduce public health risks and protect the environmental integrity of the OECS countries and their coastal and marine systems by improving solid waste management systems. The total regional financing for this project is US$24 million, with the component for St. Kitts and Nevis accounting for US$3.33 million (US$2.13 million from the World Bank/ US$1.2 million GEF). The OECS Telecommunications Reform Program, approved in FY98 seeks to introduce pro-competition reforms in the telecommunications sectors and increase the supply of informatics-related skills in five OECS borrowing countries: the Commonwealth of Dominica ,Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The project has helped the OECS countries negotiate with the sub-regional telecom monopoly and lower the long distance and regional telephone rates. The share for St. Kitts and Nevis in the US$6.0 million loan is US$1.2 million. The Disaster Management Project, approved in FY99, is part of a regional program for five OECS borrowing countries to fortify, reconstruct, and rehabilitate key economic and social infrastructure and facilities to minimize damage caused by natural and man-made disasters and to speed-up emergency recovery following such disasters. Additionally, the project aims to strengthen countries’ institutional capacities to prepare for and respond to disaster emergencies efficiently and effectively. The total program size is US$19.5 million, and the St. Kitts and Nevis project is for US$8.5 million (including a fast disbursing component of US$2.5 million to assist with reconstruction following Hurricane George.) The Emergency Recovery Project for the OECS was approved on March 7,2002 to help mitigate the impact of the September 11 attack on the tourism sector. The project will support strengthened airport and seaport security and ensure the maintenance of critical imports for the tourism sector. The World Bank’s assistance for this project is US$21 million, including US$4.4 million for St. Kitts and Nevis. II. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board an Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on June 28, 2001. For FY02-06, the CAS, which covers Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - APPENDIX II St. Kitts and Nevis, proposes new commitments of US$l 10 million for the five OECS World Bank borrowers. Under this CAS, in FY03, St. Kitts and Nevis is expected to receive US$5 million out of a US$41 million sub-regional OECS Education Reform Project and US$3 million out of a US$l55 million Caribbean-wide HIV/AIDS program. The CAS also foresees lending to St. Kitts and Nevis for a Regulatory Reform Project for the electricity sector (US$lO.O million) and a Public Sector Reform project (US$5.0 million), both in FY04. In addition, the Bank is preparing four reports on institutional development in the OECS. Three of these reports are currently being finalized for publication: the OECS Institutional and Organizational Review, the Country Procurement Assessment Review, and the County Financial Accountability Assessment. The Bank is also finalizing a public expenditure review for St. Kitts and Nevis, as part of the first stage of the overall OECS Fiscal Issues Report. For the next meeting of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED), which will take place in Washington, DC, in June 2002, the Bank is preparing three reports covering the whole Caribbean region: Natural Risk Management in the Caribbean Region: Revisiting the Challenge; Youth Development in the Caribbean Countries; and the Caribbean Economic Overview 2002.

Projects St. Kitts and Nevis is a borrower member of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). CDB has supports economic and social development in St. Kitts and Nevis by financing a number of projects in such sectors as agriculture, forestry and fishing, manufacturing, tourism, mining, power and energy, transportation and communication, housing, education, health, disaster rehabilitation and basic needs, and providing technical assistance mainly for institutional strengthening and training. From 1970 to 2001, CDB approved for St. Kitts and Nevis 63 capital loans, 6 contingent recovery loans, 43 technical assistance grants and 1 equity participation, totaling US$122.6 million. At end-2001, there was US$43.8 million in undrawn balances of committed resources for CDB-financed projects. The factors that generally impact on the level of disbursement include a weak implementation capacity due to a shortage of technical and management staff, the inability to provide counterpart financing on a timely basis and difficulties in the timely compliance with CDB’s procurement procedures. Total approvals in 2001 were US$25 million for five projects. These projects were the Nevis Power Project (US$6 million), the Nevis Road Improvement and Maintenance Project (US$3.8 million) in Nevis (US$3.8 million), OECS Waste Management Project (US$5.1 million), Consolidated line of credit to the Development Bank of St. Kitts and Nevis (US$9.9 million) and the Emergency Tourism Promotions Program ((US$O.4 million). Total approvals in 2000 was US$3.7 million for three projects, of which two were for technical assistance; the Natural Disaster Management Immediate Response Loan (US$O.5 million), and technical assistance for the Road Transport Master Plan (US$O.2 million) and for the Natural Disaster Management Rehabilitation Project (US$3 million).

Real sector There are a number of deficiencies in the real sector statistics. Data on GDP broken down by type of expenditure are not available at constant prices, while the data at current prices are not reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross capital formation. Private final consumption expenditure is estimated as a residual. A new CPI with weights from the 2000 household expenditure survey will be introduced shortly, replacing the older CPI which uses 1978 as the base year. No data are currently available on labor market developments. Results of the 2001 population census are currently being analyzed. 2. Public finances Data on revenue, expenditure, and financing of the consolidated central government (St. Kitts and Nevis) are made available to Fund staff on request. There are a number of technical problems that need to be addressed, including a discrepancy between the overall balance (the difference between revenues and expenditures) and available financing. Previous missions have identified this discrepancy as arising from the inability to capture all expenditures, such as appropriation-in-aid loans and the so-called “below the line” expenditures. The authorities could benefit from technical assistance in devising a set of fully integrated accounts for the central government that are produced on a regular basis. Also, it would be useful to institute a mechanism for the regular reporting of financial data of the rest of the public sector. The authorities do not report fiscal data for publication in IFS. The latest data published in the GFS Yearbook are for 1994. 3. Balance of payments and external debt Data on the balance of payments are annual and only available with long lags. Revised balance of payments data for 1996 - 2000 were published in the January issue of the monthly International Financial Statistics publication. Data on external trade (especially exports) are not comprehensive, as they omit important categories of goods. Most components of the data on financial flows also need improvement. It would be useful to reconcile the data on the public sector investment plan for external loans with the external debt database compiled by the ECCB.

Losses-averaging 3.5 percent of GDP from 1998 to 2001-stem from SSMC’s high production costs and gradual erosion of preferential access to European Union and US markets. These losses are financed through an overdraft facility granted by the majority government-owned National Bank. This overdraft has been secured by a mortgage on sugar lands owned by the SSMC. At end-2001 the overdraft of the SSMC was nearly19 percent of GDP. The sugar company employs about 1,000 permanent workers-about 7 percent of the labor force-who during harvesting season are supplemented by around 600 migrant workers. Reflecting the absence of any substantial investment for quite some time, the physical capital stock of the sugar company is in poor condition. There is a general consensus that sugar production in St. Kitts and Nevis is unprofitable and that closure is likely. The government of St. Kitts and Nevis has been actively engaged in seeking a solution to the losses of the company. This has involved seeking expert advice on the various options that might be available, and a broad-based consultative process in the country to seek the views of the population. In 1998 a World Bank-funded study examined the following options along with their cost implications.’ Maintaining the company. Under this option, the industry would operate at maximum efficiency with only minimal investment to remove capacity constraints. Even with optimistic assumptions about world sugar prices, the study indicated that losses would continue. An alternative option would involve reducing production to match the level of export quota, with surplus land diverted to non-sugar agriculture. Losses would fall, but not eliminated. A third, more aggressive strategy would involve a substantial capital investment, dedicating production to by-products and other alternatives to white sugar. This would entail the introduction of mechanized harvesting. Losses could be reduced under this approach, but not eliminated. Closure of the company. Under this option production of sugarcane would cease ant the sugar factory would be closed. Some of the land under sugarcane could be distributed to industry workers for non-sugar agricultural production, entailing a transition of about five years, during which the loss of export earnings from sugar would not be compensated by increased agricultural production. The government would provide support services. In order to supplement the findings of the 1998 study, in 2000 the government initiated a Report on the Way Forward for the Sugar Industry.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis On [June 7, 20021, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis.’ Background Following the widespread damage caused by hurricanes in 1998-99, real GDP rose sharply in 2000, reflecting an increase in domestic demand that stemmed from spending on post- hurricane repair and reconstruction. Economic activity continued to be robust in the first three quarters of 2001, based on construction, a rebound in tourist arrivals, and increased sugar production. However, following the September 11 attacks, the number of stayover tourists fell sharply; activity in tourism-dependent sectors, such as road transportation and retail sales declined; and exports to the U.S. were virtually halted. As a result, real GDP growth slowed to just below 2 percent for 2001 as a whole. Preliminary indicators point to a decline in real GDP by 2-3 percent in 2002. No current information is available on employment, but hours worked in the tourism and manufacturing declined in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002. In recent years, inflation has been contained to 2-3 percent. Notwithstanding the surge in reconstruction-related imports, the external current account deficit narrowed to 17% percent of GDP in 2000 (23 percent in 1999) owing to a sharp increase in ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [June 7, 20021 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

The deficit widened to 33 percent of GDP in 2001, reflecting the weakening of tourism demand and exports, and lower private transfers. The deficits in recent years have been financed by official commercial loans and direct investment. The central government finances have weakened in recent years, as the rapid growth of expenditure-mainly on the wage bill, interest, and infrastructure-combined with a weak revenue performance that stemmed, in part, from tax exemptions to the tourism and manufacturing sectors. These factors, together with the rapid growth in spending on post- hurricane reconstruction, led to a widening of the overall central government deficit to 14% percent of GDP in 2000 (from 6 percent in 1998). Fiscal performance began to improve in 2001, in response to increases in some tax rates, while the growth in spending was contained. Following the September attacks, the authorities cut back sharply on spending in the fourth quarter, including canceling the end-year bonus to civil servants. As a result, the overall deficit narrowed to 12% percent of GDP in 2001. Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2002 indicate that government revenue increased by about YZ of one percentage point of GDP, owing to a strengthening of tax collection efforts. The central government deficits and the losses of the sugar company have resulted in a sharp increase in the public debt, from 86 percent of GDP at end-l 998 to 122 percent of GDP at end-2001, among the highest ratios in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). Broad money growth slowed in 2001, but the commercial banks’ liquidity position continued to increase, owing to the government’s refinancing of part of its bank debt, and a decline in private sector credit. Despite these factors, and a lowering of the discount rate by the ECCB in October, domestic interest rates remained unchanged in 2001, with the average lending rate at 11.2 percent, and the average deposit rate at 4.3 percent. The first quarter of 2002 witnessed a further decline in private sector credit. During 2001 emphasis in the area of structural reform was placed on upgrading the skills of civil servants, and setting up a Public Sector Reform Unit in which all civil service reform efforts are centralized. Also, the liberalization of the telecommunications sector began with the breakup of the monopoly on domestic cellular services. In the offshore sector, a Financial Intelligence Unit was established; legislation was approved that permits the sharing of information with other jurisdictions, and criminalizes the laundering of proceeds from all crimes; and the authorities have begun to implement the recommendations based on the Module I self-assessment conducted with the assistance of the Fund and the ECCB. St. Kitts and Nevis remains on the FATF list of weak jurisdictions for offshore financial services and anti-money laundering efforts, but was removed from the OECD’s list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions in March 2002. The country’s inclusion in the FATF list will be reviewed in June 2002. On the domestic front, the Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange (ECSE), a regional market in corporate securities based at the central bank in St. Kitts, began operations in January 2002. Trading on the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM) is expected to commence later this year.
