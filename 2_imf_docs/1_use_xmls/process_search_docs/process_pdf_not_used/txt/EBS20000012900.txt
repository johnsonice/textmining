Notwithstanding robust real GDP growth, low inflation, and progress in implementing a number of structural reforms, there were budgetary slippages through March 2000. As a result, a number of quantitative performance criteria were not observed. Resolution of the government’s seizure of the Gambia Groundnut Corporation’s (GGC) property is still outstanding. 0 Real GDP grew by 5.6 percent in 1999, exceeding the program target, mainly as a result of good rains. The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) declined to 10% percent of GDP from 11 l/2 percent in 1998, largely because of lower imports. The focal deficit (excluding grants) increased to 4.8 percent of GDP from 4.4 percent in 1998, reflecting policy slippages and the adverse impact of the preshipment inspection scheme on imports and customs revenue. Including grants, the deficit increased from 2.4 percent of GDP to 3.5 percent. Monetary policy was largely accommodating as domestic credit expansion exceeded the program targets through March 2000. The treasury bill rate declined from 14 percent in December 1998 to 12 percent by end-March 2000. 0 Structural reform implementation was satisfactory. Two structural performance criteria to undertake a survey of outstanding government arrears and introduce a short-term liquidity forecasting framework at the central bank were met. In addition, there were significant increases in domestic petroleum product prices, and further progress was made with the privatization of public enterprises, and the implementation of new groundnut marketing arrangements that exclude a direct role for the government. Elements of the program for the balance of 2000 l The objective of the revised program is to strengthen performance through corrective fiscal measures and prudent monetary policy and bring the adjustment process back on track. Inflation is projected at below 3 percent, while real GDP is expected to grow by 4.9 percent. The external current account deficit is projected to moderate further in 2000, and gross reserves to increase to about six months of imports. l Prior actions under the program comprise (a) abolition of the preshipment inspection scheme was introduced in October 1999; (b) introduction of reporting and control safeguards on government expenditure; and (c) establishment of arrangements to pay off gove&nent arrears with the use of specific quarterly targets. .

The governance program envisages judicial reforms, government decentralization, and civic education initiatives. Further reductions in external tariff will take effect in July. An interim poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) is to be prepared by end-2000, and a full PRSP by end-2001. A debt sustainability analysis has been undertaken, which, on a preliminary basis, suggests that The Gambia could qualify for assistance under both the fiscal and export windows of the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Issues highlighted in the staff appraisal l The revised program focuses on restoring macroeconomic stability and paving the way for a lasting reduction in poverty. To realize these objectives, it is crucial for the authorities to do the following: (0 Continue to strengthen budgetary implementation to bring fiscal performance broadly in line with the original program, and pursue prudent monetary policy while consolidating and deepening reforms in the financial sector; (ii) Resolve urgently the GGC property dispute and implement measures to strengthen governance. This requires timely implementation of the comprehensive program adopted at the roundtable meeting in March 2000, in addition to the business-related reform to improve the environment for private sector activity. The staff welcomes the judicial and other reforms undertaken and urges the authorities to seek broad consultation and technical assistance to expedite progress in these areas; and (iii) Expedite other structural reforms and continue making progress in executing the PRSP process. l The staff welcomes the further reduction in the external tariff. It notes the progress in economic and financial data compilation and urges the authorities to continue with efforts to further improve the timeliness and quality of data. l The staff considers the revised program for 2000 to be comprehensive and, following the implementation of prior actions, recommends approval by the Executive Board of the authorities’ request for waivers on the nonobservance of a number of performance criteria.

Discussions for the 2000 Article IV consultations and first review of the economic program supported by the second annual arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were held in Banjul during the period May l-l 7,200O. ’ The Gambian representatives included the Hon. F. Jatta, Secretary of State for Finance and Economic Affairs, Mr. M. C. Bajo, Governor of the Central Bank of The Gambia, and other ministers and senior officials of the government and public enterprises. Vice-President Isatou Njie-Saidy received the mission, which also held discussions with representatives of the donor community, civil society, and the private sector. The three-year arrangement under the PRGF, in an amount of SDR 20.6 1 million F66.3 percent of quota), and the first annual arrangement thereunder, in an amount of SDR 3.4 million, were approved by the Executive Board on June 29, 1998 (EBS/98/102; Sup. 1; 6/30/98). However, the midterm review under the fast annual arrangement could not be completed because of slippages in the implementation of the budget and structural reforms. Moreover, there were governance problems arising from the government’s seizure of the property of the Gambia Groundnut Corporation (GGC)--a private marketing monopoly. On November 19,1999, the Executive Board approved the second annual PRGF arrangement to support the program for the period October 1, 1999-September 30,2000, in an amount of SDR 8.6 million (27.6 percent of quota; EBS/99/201; Cor. 1; 1 I/8/99). An amount of SDR 3.435 million was disbursed upon Board approval, and the second disbursement, for the same amount, will become available subject to observance of the end- March 2000 quantitative performance criteria and end-February 2000 and end-June 2000 structural performance criteria and completion of the first review. In concluding the 1999 Article IV consultation on June 18, 1999 (EBM/99/67), Executive Directors expressed concern about slippages in program implementation. They stressed the need for significant progress in implementing corrective fiscal measures and an early settlement of the governance issues, in order to demonstrate the authorities’ commitment to the program. 3. In the attached letter to the Managing Director dated July 7,200O (Appendix I), the government cf The Gambia reviews economic and financial performance during the first half of the program supported by the second annual PRGF arrangement, and outlines its objectives and policies for the balance of 2000. It also requests waivers for the nonobservance of the end-March 2000 quantitative performance criteria with respect to (a) net bank credit to the central government, (b) net domestic assets of the central bank, and (c) the basic primary balance of the central government. ’ The staff team consisted of Mr. Kibuka (Head), Mr. Tjirongo, Mr. Nakata, Mr. Christensen, and Ms. Cone11 (assistant), all AFR. Mr. Kalonji (PDR) joined the mission for a few days to work on the debt sustainability analysis. A parallel World Bank mission was also in the field. A staff team visited Banjul during February 12-19,200O to initiate discussions with the authorities on the PRSP process, review the 2000 budget, and discuss corrective measures.

A roundtable donors’ meeting for The Gambia was held during November 21-22, 1999 in Geneva, during which donors welcomed the Fund’s approval of the second annual PRGF arrangement and agreed to provide additional resources to close the remaining modest fmancing gap for 2000. 5. At end-May 2000, The Gambia’s outstanding use of Fund resources was SDR 8.17 million, or 26.3 percent of quota. If the full amount under the second annual PRGF arrangement is disbursed, and taking into account scheduled repayments, The Gambia’s use of Fund resources would rise from 26.6 percent of quota at end-1999 to about 44.8 percent by end-December 2000 (Tables 1 and 2). In 1993, The Gambia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(u), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and it maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) and The Gambia’s relations with the Fund, the African Development Bank, and the World Bank Group are summarized in Appendices II, III, IV, and V, respectively. 6. The outstanding statistical issues include the need to rebase the national accounts to a more recent period, broaden the coverage of the price index, and improve the timeliness and quality of fiscal, balance of payments, monetary, and social data. While these data weaknesses do not prevent a meaningful assessment of economic policies, they require significant improvement to facilitate the analysis of economic developments (see Appendix VI). II. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOP&~ 7. Real GDP grew by 5.6 percent in 1999, with the particul&ly strong performance of tourism and agriculture (Figure 1 and Tables 3 and 4). Increased food production helped dampen end-of-period inflation (based on the low income consumer price index), which remained below the program target of 2 percent. 8. The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) declined to about 10% percent of GDP in 1999 from 1 11/2 percent in 1998. The significant decline in imports following the introduction of preshipment inspection more than offset the impact of weaker export performance, stemming in part from the seizure of the GGC’s property.3 Gross official reserves increased slightly to SDR 78 million (5.7 months of imports) but fell short of the end- 1999 program target. However, the end-March 2000 quantitative performance 2 Details on recent developments are provided in the letter of intent (see Appendix I). 3 A contract was signed with BIVAC to introduce preshipment inspection effective October 1999 on imports into The Gambia, resulting in a substantial decline in imports reexported to the region. The inspection fees were 1.4 percent of the c.i.f. value of imports without exemptions, with a minimum charge of US$250, all payable in U.S. dollars. Effective May 2000, the minimum charge was payable in dalasi. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-a- Figure 1.

The outstanding external debt of The Gambia, which was SDR 3 10.9 million (97.8 percent of GDP) at end- 1999-mostly concessional loans owed to multilateral development institutions-was serviced on a timely basis, with a debt-service ratio that generally declined to 10.9 percent through 1999. In real effective terms, the dalasi depreciated by 2.3 percent in 1999 after declining by 4.3 percent during 1997-98 (Figure 2). 9. There were slippages in implementing the budget during 1999. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) rose to 4.8 percent of GDP, compared with a programmed decline to 3.1 percent, while the deficit (including grants) increased by one percentage point of GDP to 3.5 percent (Table 5). During the fourth quarter, there was a shortfall in customs duty receipts equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP following the introduction of the preshipment inspection scheme. Moreover, other recurrent expenditure, including domestic interest payments, exceeded the program target by 0.9 percent of GDP. A major reason for this outcome was the authorities’ weakening ability to report and control certain expenditure, owing to the proliferation of the “below-the-line (BTL) accounts” over the last few years (see Box 1). The overall deficit was financed by domestic bank borrowing, which exceeded the program target by 4 % percent of the beginning-of-period money stock; as a result total outstanding government domestic debt rose from 26 percent of GDP in 1998 to about 27 percent of GDP at end- 1999. -9- 10. Monetary policy was largely accommodating as credit expansion to the government and the private sector exceeded the program targets through end-March 2000 (Table 6). Within the private sector, credit to the distributive trade sector generally stagnated in line with the faltering import activities, while, during the first quarter of 2000, credit expansion for the sector was entirely accounted for by the financing of the groundnut crop. Efforts by the central bank to mop up commercial banks’ excess reserves through open market operations were unsuccessful as banks’ excess reserves increased slightly through end-March 2000. Moreover, the treasury bill rate declined from 14 percent in December 1998 to 12 percent by end-March 2000. 11. There are signs of improvement in the banking system. Nonperforming loans, which accounted for 26 percent of total bank loans at end-March 1998, declined significantly to 16 percent by end-December 1999 and eased further to 15 percent at end-March 2000, while required provisioning remained above 100 percent. All banks met the required capital adequacy ratio of 8 percent and the liquid asset ratio of 30 percent. On-site inspections were conducted in 1999 for two banks, of which one had a number of management issues, which are being addressed. Moreover, the government continued to make timely payments toward the elimination of the debt of the def!u.nct Gambia Cooperative Union (GCU) to a major commercial bank 12.

Issues in Budgetary Performance, 1995-99 The overall budget deficit (excluding grants) peaked at 12 percent in 1995/96 (July-June). Under the PRGF- supported program starting in 1998, the Gambian authorities implemented better expenditure control and revenue mobilization, leading to a reduction in the budget deficit and the domestic debt. On the revenue side, despite sizable reductions in external tariffs in 1998 and 1999, domestic revenues actually increased to 18% percent of GDP in 1998 fi-om 17% percent in 1995/96. However, the introduction of the preshipment inspection in October 1999 reversed this trend and the share of domestic revenues dropped to 17% percent of GDP in 1999. On the expenditure side, total outlays, including net lending, dropped from about 30 percent of GDP in 1995/96 to 22% percent in 1999. Consequently, the overall budget deficit declined from 7.8 percent as a ratio of GDP in 1997 to 4.4 percent and 4.8 percent in 1998 and 1999, respectively; in both cases, though, they were above the program targets of 4 percent in 1998 and 3 percent in 1999. The inability, thus far, to reduce the budget deficit to program targets reflects, apart from the revenue shortfall in 1999, an underlying problem with containing non-interest-recurrent expenditure, especially during the fourth quarter (see figure below). The lack of effective cash management, based on forward-looking revenue projections formulated after careful monitoring of the recent past, is a major cause for overspending. One other important reason for the weakening of control and monitoring of expenditure has been the proliferation of the below-the-line (BTL) accounts at the Accountant General’s Office (AGO). BTL accounts are created as book entries at the AGO, usually toward the end of the financial year (end-December) to obviate the lapse of expenditure authorization that would otherwise interrupt programs or projects that overlap financial years. The total BTL balances amounted to D 117 million (about 14 percent of total government balances) as of May 3, 2000. The method of establishing BTL accounts has created a number of problems. When the AGO establishes BTL accounts, it treats them as an “expenditure” and “debits” the consolidated revenue fimd (CRF) to “credit” the BTL account. Subsequently, expenditure from the BTL accounts is usually effected by direct issuance of checks, rather than by vouchers, which require a number of reporting and control procedures, mainly by Internal Audit. Until recently, neither the AGO nor the Department of State for Finance and Economic Affairs (DOSFEA) monitored the balances in these accounts on a regular basis (such activity was also partly hampered by antiquated computers and software in the AGO). At the central bank, however, balances in the CRF (indeed, the overall government balances) are unaffected by the AGO’s book entries that establish BTL accounts, and government expenditures arc recorded only when the CRF is debited and the central bank makes a corresponding cash transfer. The different approaches in recording government expenditure and the inability of DOSFEA to effectively monitor and control BTL accounts have made it difficult to reconcile the accounts of the DOSFEA and those of the central bank. The problem has been compounded by the fact that DOSFEA normally releases the bulk of expenditure allocations during the fourth quarter of the year and, lacking adequate records, does not take into account balances in BTL accounts when it prepares the annual budget and allocates expenditure priorities and ceilings for the financial year. With Fund Total non-interest-recurrent (In millions of dalasis) technical assistance, DGSFEA has initiated steps to review the operations of the BTL accounts, including comprehensive reporting and control of all expenditures, thereby expediting reconciliation of the AGO’s general ledger with the government balances at the central bank on a timely basis. Moreover, in May 2000, DOSFEA issued a circular to stop further creation of BTL accounts and to impose stringent reporting and control procedures on existing BTL accounts. All BTL accounts will be reviewed, with a view to closing a number of them, subject to cabinet approval. It is expected that the implementation of these measures and other reforms should gain momentum when an IMF resident budget advisor takes up his post in July 2000.

This development was the result of the fiscal slippages mentioned above and the mid-March salary advance to civil servants; however, the latter is repayable through automatic salary deductions by end-September and should not have a significant impact on the fiscal outturn for the year as a whole. 13. However, implementation of structural reforms continued broadly as scheduled, including (a) the completion of a comprehensive survey of government arrears, a structural performance criterion for end-February 2000; (b) the reconciliation of the treasury accounts with those of the central bank; and (c) the privatization of the Atlantic Hotel and the sale of the Trust Bank Building, as well as other measures detailed in paragraph 7 of the attached letter of intent. 14. The legal and bilateral channels to settle the dispute on the GGC property have progressed slowly (see paragraph 19 of the letter of intent in Appendix I) notwithstanding the government’s initiatives to approach Alimenta and its efforts to continue to adhere to the procedures of the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The cost to the economy remains the damage to investor confidence. In the meantime, it has also been difficult to attract alternative, experienced groundnut buyers to The Gambia (see below). The government may also incur financial costs when settlement of the dispute is reached.4 IIJ. REPORTONTHE DISCUSSIONS 15. The discussions took place against the background of the recent weakening in the fiscal stance and focused on corrective measures to bring the program back on track, as well as on the broader emerging issues affecting the reexport trade, groundnut, and tourism sectors. These sectors account for a sizable share of output and employment, and have significant implications for the ongoing preparation of a poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP). The discussions also covered technical assistance issues, as well as the debt sustainability analysis, which is intended to assess The Gambia’s eligibility under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. 16. Developments so far in 2000 indicate a likely slowdown in real GDP growth, now projected at 4.9 percent. Inflation is projected to remain below 3 percent. The key reexport trade, tourism, and groundnut sectors face some early but largely reversible difficulties as a result of the introduction of the preshipment inspection scheme, recent civil unrest, the lack of a coherent strategy to develop tourism, and uncertain groundnut marketing arrangements.’ 4 For details on the background of the dispute and the subsequent developments, see EBS/99/201 (8/l 1199). 5 The worldwide millennium-related anxieties (which prompted tourists to stay at or return home early) truncated the 1999 tourist season at its height in the third week of December, (continued.. .) - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicIn particular, the ongoing dispute between the government and Alimenta-the GGC parent company--over the seizure of its property continues to prevent agreement on a permanent arrangement for processing, marketing, and access to foreign financing for the groundnut crop. The external outlook remains favorable because of the recent bumper groundnut crop and the expected recovery in reexports, notwithstanding higher imports. The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected to moderate further to 10 ‘/ percent of GDP in 2000 (Table 8). A. Fiscal Policy 17. Parliament approved the 2000 budget in January, which, except for the new revenue measures equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP in excess of the program revenue target and higher recurrent expenditure, was virtually in line with the original program. The new revenue measures comprised a 20 percent average increase in domestic prices of petroleum products effective January 1,200O and miscellaneous increases in nontax revenue items.6 The budget also provided for a reduction in the maximum external tariff from 20 percent to 18 percent effective July 1,2000, consistent with the program. However, by the time of its approval the budget had been overtaken by the revenue shortfalls and expenditure excesses during the fourth quarter of 1999 and the first quarter of 2000. 18. Accordingly, the original budget projections for 2000 were revised to take into account recent developments and the measures needed to correct the slippages and keep the deficit (excluding grants) broadly within the original program target of 2.5 percent of GDP (for details, see letter of intent, Appendix I). Including grants, the deficit is projected to decline to about 1 percent of GDP. To offset the gap of 1.2 percent of GDP that would have emerged without additional measures, the authorities implemented the following actions: (a) a tier increase in diesel prices of 8 percent and an average 28 percent increase in the domestic duty-free prices of petroleum products, both effective February 2000, -yielding-O.3 percent of GDP; (b) as a prior action (see subsection G below), the abolition of the preshipment inspection scheme effective July 1,2000, to yield an estimated 0.6 percent of GDP;7 and (c) collection of tax arrears from the proceeds of the sale of two defaulting hotels to cover the balance. and recovery has been further delayed by the concerns raised by the civil disturbances through April 2000. 6 When approving the increase in petroleum product prices, parliament also authorized the Secretary of State for Finance and Economic Affairs to henceforth adjust these prices on the basis of an existing formula without further parliamentary approval. 7 Estimated from the impact of (a) some recovery in import volume (yielding 0.4 percent of GDP); and (b) the elimination of revenue collection lags caused by delays in preshipment inspection procedures (Box 2).

Problems in Implementing the Preshipment Inspection (PSI) Scheme The government introduced the preshipment inspection (PSI) scheme on imports destined to The Gambia effective October 1999 by awarding an uncompetitive bid to BIVAC. Although at the time PSI was expected to improve customs revenue collection, there were inadequate preparations and lack of consultations with key institutions like the Customs Department and the Port Authority. Thus, a number of problems, including those listed below, led to the conclusion that the scheme is not suited to The Gambia. l Administrative problems with PSI included the lack of coordination with the Port Authority and the Customs Department, and significant delays--of up to eight weeks--occurred in clearing goods and in the collection of customs revenue. In February 2000, the local manager of BIVAC had to be removed. l PSI valuation was lower than that of the Customs Department for a number of items, leading to some loss of revenue. l PSI fees were quite high, at 1.4 percent of the c.i.f. value, with no exemptions. Fees were payable in U.S. dollars with a minimum fee of l The Gambian economy is highly dependent on trade (25 percent of GDP), and over 50 percent of imports are reexported to the region. Reexports account for 87 percent of total exports of goods and nonfactor services. Employment in the sector, including at the port, warehouses and even at the retail level, is significant. The higher financial costs and delays caused by PSI led to a substantial trade diversion to the region. l Port Authority data indicate that port traffic declined by 22.5 percent during December 1999 to January 2000, compared with a similar period in the previous year. For 1999, imports declined by 8 percent, while reexports fell by 15 percent compared with 1998. l During the fourth quarter of 1999 there was a shortfall in customs receipts and sales tax on imports of D 58 million (1.2 percent of GDP). In December 1999, customs revenue was only 62 percent of comparable collections in December 1998, and even 4 percent below similar collections in December 19. In addition, as a prior action, the authorities adopted a program- to eliminate government arrears to public enterprises-estimated at D 26 million (0.5 percent of GDP) at end-1999-entailing a minimum down payment of D 11 million by end-June 2000. As part of this program, the public enterprises have also agreed to a payment schedule to eliminate their arrears to the government of 0.4 percent of GDP during the year. Moreover, the government will pay an estimated 0.5 percent of GDP from the divestiture account to reduce its domestic debt at the central bank in the course of 2000. Altogether, net government repayment to the domestic banking system under the revised fiscal program for the balance of 2000 will amount to an estimated 0.8 percent of GDP, broadly in line with the original program target. 20, Supporting budgetary reforms include full implementation of the automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA) by July 2000, enhanced coordination between the two revenue departments, and timely reconciliation of their accounts with those of the central bank to facilitate revenue collection. On the expenditure side, the government issued a - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 circular in May (fulfilling a prior action) reforming the accounting practices to permit comprehensive reporting and control of expenditure, especially on the BTL accounts. Timely information on these accounts will also allow a faster reconciliation of treasury and central bank accounts to facilitate macroeconomic policy coordination. The Fund’s long-term budget expert is expected to play a key role in the implementation of these and other reforms to strengthen institutional capacity. B. Monetary and Financial Sector Issues 21. Monetary policy aims to maintain low inflation during 2000 and strengthen external reserves. Accordingly, the monetary authorities undertook to step up open market operations to moderate the growth of broad money from an estimated 24 percent at end- March 2000 to about 12% percent by end-2000. The programmed government net repayment to the banking sector, including from the divestiture proceeds, would allow private sector credit to grow by 16112 percent for the year. 22. With regard to reforms in the financial sector, the mission concurred with the authorities’ assessment that increasing bank competition augured well for the development of the money market. This development, in turn, should facilitate implementation of the arrangements to fmalize the setting up of a short-term liquidity forecasting system and the related arrangements to launch the Open Market Operations Committee, with technical assistance provided by a short-term Fund expert in May 2000. The central bank is also undertaking various measures to strengthen its regulatory and supervisory roles, including finalizing the Financial Institutions and Insurance Bills, which are to be submitted to parliament by July. The central bank has also benefited from Fund technical assistance in making further progress toward introducing foreign currency deposits and in continuing to improve the reporting of monetary and balance of payments data. It will also continue implementing its annual program with the banks to maintain full provisioning for nonperforming loans and to maintain their capital adequacy ratios above the legal requirement of 8 percent. 23. In April 2000, The Gambia, together with five other West African countries: signed the Accra Declaration to establish a currency union by 2003. The authorities explained that, while the primary convergence criteria (see para. 15 of the letter of intent, Appendix I) were not likely to present a major problem for The Gambia, the details of the measures that would be needed to achieve these targets had not yet been discussed and agreed by the partner countries. C. Structural and Sectoral Policies 24. The authorities are determined to pursue the structural reforms envisaged under the program and to undertake the corrective measures in the three key sectors of * The other countries are Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

In mid-June, the government approved the lifting of the preshipment inspection scheme effective July 1, which, together with a reduction in the external tariff, should help restore the entrep6t activities in the country. The government also approved an expeditious settlement with Alimenta on the GGC property, which would be complemented by close collaboration with the European Union (EU) to further develop groundnut marketing arrangements aimed at fostering farmer activity. To this end, the Agri-Business Service Plan Association (ASPA), made up of farmers and buyers, will be encouraged to publicly announce producer prices early in the planting season, and every effort will be made to secure timely crop-financing arrangements that exclude the government’s participation. The problems in the tourism sector will be addressed largely in the context of further reforms to investment incentives-including expedited access to serviced land and permission to tourist operators to introduce some all-inclusive tourist packages-but also through the planned development of a medium-term strategy for 200 l-06 to substantially upgrade the sector. 25. The government held a roundtable meeting on governance in Banjul in March 2000, during which it outlined a comprehensive reform program that includes judicial reform, decentralization of the government, enhanced civic education, and other measures discussed in detail in the letter of intent (Appendix I). The modernization of business- related legislation and regulations is being speeded up with the following actions: (a) reforms in the judicial system to reduce the backlog of court cases, including those in the commercial branch of the high court, by increasing the number of high court judges by 50 percent and opening four regional courts by October 2000; (b) drafting of a new comprehensive procurement code with external technical assistance that meets the latest international standards; (c) the seeking of parliamentary approval of an interim Investment Bill-currently under review in the Department of State for Justice--that will also provide the legal framework for the export processing zone which will be supported by the proposed World Bank Trade Gateway Project; (d) ongoing discussions with the Commonwealth Secretariat aimed at developing a competition policy, and eventually the drafting of a Competition Bill to facilitate competitive business activities; and (e) drafting of the Privatization Agency Bill, which will be submitted to parliament for approval in June 2000. 26. The government intends to rigorously implement the terms of the Memoranda of understanding (MOUs) agreed upon with a number of public enterprises in 1998. It will take the necessary measures to prevent any l%rther accumulation of payments arrears and insist that all public enterprises fully meet their tax, debt-service, and dividend obligations. The authorities indicated that, in addition to the privatization of the Atlantic Hotel in December 1999 and the sale of the Trust Bank Building in February 2000, they planned to bring to the point of sale the National Printing and Stationery Corporation, the Maintenance Service Agency, the Kuntaur Rice Mill, and Gambia International Airline. With regard to The Gambia Telecommunications Company Limited (GAMTEL), the cabinet decided in April ZOOO.to separate its broadcasting and telecommunications activities as a first step toward privatization. The authorities are also working with the World Bank staff to @fine a sectoral strategy and establish a partnership with a South Afr-ican company for the National Water and Energy Corporation.

To strengthen participation in the poverty reduction efforts, the authorities have launched a comprehensive review of the Strategy for Poverty Alleviation, initiated in 1992, and the various social projects and programs detailed in the policy framework paper (EBD/99/128; 1 l/8/99). In this context, the government has been engaged in broad-based consultations, most recently during the May 8 meeting in Banjul attended by Bank and Fund staff, donors, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector to elaborate and seek inputs in the preparation of an interim poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) and, eventually, a full-fledged PRSP (see Box 5). The PRSP process is expected to give the poor greater participation through a system of decentralized government and through the Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPAs), aimed at influencing the provision of public services in key sectors like agriculture, education, and health, and at facilitating employment creation. 28. The mission was in agreement with the authorities’ views that the updating of the comprehensive poverty reduction strategy would place a considerable burden on institutional capacity and necessitate further reforms to improve the environment for private sector activity and enhance the delivery and monitoring of public services. In this context, the government intends to intensify collaboration with donors, including the Fund, to ensure timely access to technical assistance. Moreover, the authorities are holding discussions with the World Bank to expedite a Capacity-Building and Economic Management Project. E. External Sector Policies and Balance of Payments Outlook 29. The balance of payments outlook, based on the policies detailed above and the most recent World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections, suggests that the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) would narrow slightly to about 10% percent of GDP in 2000. The volume of exports (including reexports) is projected to increase by about 15 percent, largely reflecting a recovery in groundnut production and exports, notwithstanding the marketing problems experienced earlier in the year. Fish exports will be aided by construction of cold storage and artisanal facilities in Banjul, while the reexport trade is also expected to recover following the removal of the preshipment inspection scheme. Import volumes are projected to grow by about 7 percent, largely because of the recovery in the reexport trade, mentioned above, and the further reduction in the external tariff. The terms of trade are projected to remain virtually unchanged in 2000. Receipts from tourism are projected to decline by 9 percent because of the low number of tourist arrivals projected through the summer. Donor assistance is projected to increase in 2000, contributing to an improvement in gross offtcial reserves to about SDR 88 million, equivalent to about six months of import cover.

Poverty Profile of The Gambia I’he Gambia is one of the poorest countries ranking 163rd out of a total of 174 countries covered in the UNDP’s nunan development indicators for 1999. The most recent household survey was conducted in 1998. The definition of income poverty used in analyzing the results was D 4,174 (US$392) per adult equivalent unit (AEU) xr year, which represents the estimated cost of a minimum consumption basket, two-thirds of which is for food. 9djustments were made for regional price differences. The extreme poor are those who cannot afford the basic food basket costing D 2,700 (US$254). The findings of the survey were as follows: 1 Poverty is widespread in The Gambia, with nearly 70 percent of the population of about 1.5 million living in poverty and 5 1 percent in extreme poverty. 1 Poverty is most prevalent in rural areas, especially among groundnut farmers-the largest group of cash crop farmers. More than 80 percent of all groundnut farmers were identified as poor with 70 percent living in extreme poverty. Seventy percent of nongroundnut farmers in rural areas are poor, while 60 percent are extremely poor. Mean annual earnings of farmers were found to be less than 75 percent of the national average. 1 The degree of poverty is less intense in urban areas although nearly 60 percent of informal urban workers were found to be poor, of which 25 percent were extremely poor. Public workers are better off, as only 40 percent were described as poor and 10 percent extremely poor. In the group of formal, privately employed people, 49 percent are poor and 13 percent extremely poor. , Poverty among groundnut farmers reflects problems in the sector encountered in recent years: - Yearly production of groundnuts averaged 81,200 tons in 1996-99, only 75 percent of the average production in the 1980s. - Earnings in the sector declined during 1997-99, as production fell and producer prices stagnated while annual consumer price index inflation averaged more than 2 percent. - Formal employment in agricultural processing and marketing fell by nearly 90 percent from 1993 to 1998 because of lower production and the closure of a major processit$plant. , - Groundnut export prices and the general terms of trade declined by 14.7 percent and 2.5 percent in 199 l-99, respectively. - Groundnut exports declined from 4.5 percent of GDP in 1991/92 (July-June) to 2.3 percent in 1999. - Average yearly fertilizer imports in 1995-98 were 62 percent lower than in 1990-94. a Gross primary education enrollment rose to 73 percent in 1999 from 59 percent in 1992. Although both sexes have equal access to primary education, female enrollment in senior secondary education constitutes only 25 percent of total enrollment. Consequently, the female illiteracy rate was 74 percent compared with the national average of 67 percent. . Women are more vulnerable to poverty. The mean annual wage of females was D 2,288 in 1998, below the extreme poverty line of 2,700 and only half of the male wage. . Malnutrition affected about 28 percent of the children, and infant mortality was observed in almost 8 percent of all births in 1997, compared with 18 percent in the early 1970s. Access to safe water was available to about 77 percent of the population in 1997. l Access to primary health facilities has improved during the past two decades, while the provision of secondary and tertiary health facilities has stagnated. The number of persons per primary health facility was on average 4,206 in 1997 compared with 15,703 in 1982. Secondary and tertiary health facilities were on average used by 54,639 and 512,933 people in 1997, compared with 40,460 and 343,908 in 1982, respectively. . The actual population growth is 4.2 percent, exceeding the natural rate of 3.0 percent. The dependency ratio is high, as more than half of the population is either less than 15 or more than 55 years old.

The outlook for the medium term will be importantly influenced by measures to address, inter alia, the structural problems in the three key sectors of the economy, namely, agriculture, trade, and tourism. The medium-term macroeconomic projections assume that the reforms discussed above will be implemented and take into account also the latest World Economic Outlook and terms of trade projections. The total volume of exports is projected to continue growing beyond 2000, at about 4 percent per annum. The volume of groundnut exports is projected to grow by an annual average of 8 percent during 2001-02, reflecting improved production and marketing arrangements, including a higher volume of processed high-quality nuts. The volume of imports is expected to grow at le@an 4 percent, in line with domestic demand and partly with the recovery in the reexport sector. The terms of trade (excluding reexports) are projected to improve in 2001, reflecting projected lower world oil prices, and to continue to improve at a moderate rate in 2002, owing to the improvement of primary product prices. Tourist arrivals are expected to grow at 5 percent in 2001-02, recovering from the 10 percent decline projected for 2000, as tourist operators improve services. In this context, and with continued implementation of the prudent financial policies envisaged in the revised program, the current account deficit (excluding offtcial transfers) is projected to improve gradually to slightly less than 10 percent of GDP in 2001 and 2002. The modest financing gap projected for 2001-02 is expected to be covered mostly by donor grants, which would permit gross official reserves to increase to at least 5% months of import coverage in 2001 and 2002. 31. The authorities reiterated their commitment to a liberal trade and exchange system, pointing, inter alia, to the further reduction in the external tariff from a maximum rate of 20 percent to 18 percent, effective July 1,2000, and the envisaged reduction of the tariff system from eight bands to three, namely, 5 percent, 10 percent, and 18 percent. These changes once again put The Gambia ahead of the members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), which reduced the maximum external tariff to 20 percent effective January 1,200O. This outcome would have the effect of reducing The Gambia’s Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public* 20 - Box 5. The PRSP Process in The Gambia ln May 2000, a joint Bank-Fund mission participated in a meeting organ&d by the authorities for donors, VGOs, and the private sector in Banjul to discuss the PRSP process. The joint mission also reviewed the zxisting databases, including a number of sectoral studies on poverty that could be used as inputs in the 2reparation of the PRSP; assessed the institutional framework for monitoring the implementation of the Strategy for Poverty Alleviation I (SPA I) and its National Poverty Alleviation Program (NPAP), the basic policy strategy introduced in 1992; and discussed the next steps in drafting the interim PRSP and the full PRSP, which are viewed as part of the process of formulating SPA II. The following key points emerged from the review: The comprehensive database on poverty, including related sectoral studies, will permit a sound assessment of the poverty situation in the country. The database includes the 1993 Population and Housing Census, 1992 Priority Survey, 1993/94 Household Economic Survey, and the 1998 Household Poverty Survey. To further improve the understanding of the nature of poverty, the NPAP coordinating body, the Strategy for Poverty Alleviation Office (SPACO), has initiated Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPAs) during the wet and dry seasons, for which the first annual report was completed in June 2000. These assessments are planned on a trial basis for the next three years and will be a major input into the development of community action plans that will improve the NPAP. In addition, the authorities have agreed to carry out a needs assessment of the Central Statistics Department, rebase the national income accounts, and conduct a household expenditure survey, to, inter alia, compile a comprehensive consumer price index. A number of sectoral studies have already been completed, including the European Union (EU) groundnut sector study, the United Nations Development Program (TJNDP) food security survey, and IDA-supported public expenditure reviews of the education and health sectors. The United Kingdom is currently assisting with a Mainstreaming Poverty and Gender Project. The authorities plan to carry out public expenditure reviews for agriculture, health and local government and have committed themselves to undertaking reforms under a comprehensive governance program to promote civic education, decentralize government, and improve the judicial system. The institutional arrangements have been strengthened to effectively coordinate and implement the various steps of the PRSP process. A lesson learned from the assessment of the most recent SPA was that the National Steering Committee, consisting of permanent secretaries and chaired by the Secretary General, was not effective, owing to its limited mandate. Given the high priority assigned to the PRSP, it was agreed earlier this year that a National Task Force (NTF) with a cabinet mandate should replace the National Steering Committee. The NTF, consisting of government officials, NGOs, the private sector, and donors, has met several times already and will report to the High-Level Economic Committee (HILEC), made up of secretaries of state and their permanent secretaries, chaired by secretaries of state of the Ministry of Finance. SPACO will be responsible for coordinating and monitoring the PRSP process during the implementation. The participatory process assumes an important role in SPA II in ensuring better national ownership including input from the poor. This process will include six divisional workshops in the course of the summer of 2000, with the participation of opinion leaders and local NGOs in each division. This will enable the grass roots to express their views on the existing SPA I and its NPAP and make suggestions for the forthcoming PRSP. Their comments will be incorporated into a draft document, which will be discussed at a national workshop in September leading to the preparation of the interim PRSP by November 2000. The PPAs will also provide inputs through the community action plans. The PRSP process entails preparation of, by early 200 1, a concept paper and a road map leading to the full-fledged PRSP. Among other things, this road map will draw on the second annual PPA report and be presented at a donor’s roundtable meeting during the second quarter of 2001. A full-fledged PRSP is expected around December 200 1, after completion of a series of divisional and national validation workshops. During the May meeting and subsequently, donors and NGOs pledged an estimated US$O.75 million in financial support, in addition to the sponsorship of a number of activities and the provision of technical assistance for the PRSP process through end-2001.

They also explained that these measures, together with the pursuit of a market-based flexible exchange rate, should significantly benefit The Gambia’s external competitiveness and facilitate the recovery of the reexport trade. The mission concurred with this assessment and considered the prevailing level of the exchange rate, in conjunction with the pursuit of prudent fiscal and monetary policies, to be broadly appropriate in maintaining The Gambia’s external competitiveness. 32. An external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was conducted jointly by the Gambian authorities and the IMF and World Bank staff. On a preliminary basis, the DSA suggests that The Gambia’s NPV of debt-to-export ratio of 186 percent at end-1999 was significantly above the 150 percent target after assessing the full use of traditional debt rescheduling mechanisms from Paris Club and other bilateral institutions, and thus the country could qualify for assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative (see Appendix II). For the comparable period, the NPV of debt to GDP amounted to 52.6 percent and about 297 percent of total government revenue (compared to the enhanced HIPC Initiative target of 250 percent). Over the medium term, the NPV of debt-to-export ratio is expected to fall to 186 percent by 2002, to 174 percent by 2005, and eventually to 157 percent by 2009. 33. With regard to the external debt, the authorities expect to reach agreement by August 2000 on the debt owed to the Norwegian export guarantee agency arising from a government-guaranteed loan to the Senegambia Beach Hotel. To further improve its debt- service profile, The Gambia will need to continue to manage its external debt prudently and rely exclusively on external grants or long-term loans on highly concessional terms. Payments to the Fund in 2000 will total SDR 1.21 million (plus SDR 0.44 million to the Saudi Fund for Development), equivalent to 1.2 percent of projected exports of goods and nonfactor services. The Gambia has an excellent record in meeting its debt service to the Fund, and, given the projected improvements in its financial policies, it is expected to discharge its future obligations to the Fund in a timely manner. F. Technical Assistance and Statistical Issues 34. The Gambia is currently receiving Fund technical assistance on expenditure management and is implementing the recommendations of Fund technical assistance missions on national income and price data, the compilation of balance of payments data, and reforms to strengthen central bank operations. The staff conducted technical consultations with the authorities as part of a pilot project. The authorities reported that ’ Revenue neutrality resulted from the reassignment of various taxable commodities among the reduced number of tariff bands, which in some cases moved some items into higher tariff bands. In addition, the number of zero-rated items for tax purposes was reduced.

With regard to data, they also acknowledged progress in a number of areas where there was scope for further improvement, especially with respect to the balance of payments, the national accounts and prices, and public finances. Moreover, the compilation of economic data has benefited from participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and the use of the framework it provides to improve the quality, timeliness, and transparency of data provision, The Gambia has also benefited from recent Fund and World Bank technical assistance in strengthening the external debt data. The authorities noted that, while these steps were likely to yield significant improvements, they faced much greater challenges in meeting the broader quality data requirements essential for the successful pursuit of an enhanced poverty reduction strategy, and they were determined to intensify their efforts in this endeavor. Effective May 2000, The Gambia’s metadata and plans for improvement were posted on the GDDS site on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board, making it among the first member countries to do so. G. Prior Actions, Program Monitoring, and Review 35. To ensure successful implementation of the program, the following prior actions were implemented by the government: (a) establishment and start implementing a program to eliminate its arrears to public enterprises by end-2000, and paid a total of D 11 million by end-June 2000 toward this endeavor; (b) issuance of a circular to curtail the creation of BTL accounts and imposed reporting-and control safeguards on existing BTL accounts; and (c) abolition of the preshipment inspection scheme. 36. The program will be monitored through quantitative benchmarks and quantitative performance criteria specified in Tables 1 and 2 of the letter of intent (Appendix I). Six quantitative performance criteria have been set for end-September 2000, which will also serve as benchmarks for end-June 2000. Four structural benchmarks are still outstanding, set for specific dates during the period through end-August 2000; in addition, two new benchmarks have been set for end-September 2000. A continuous performance criterion on the avoidance of external payments arrears has also been set. Program implementation will be evaluated during a second review, to be completed by end-December 2000. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 37. The authorities achieved some broadly encouraging results in 1999 and the first half of 2000 and performance with respect to structural reforms has been satisfactory under the program. However, policy slippages occurred in the fiscal area, and the authorities adopted the needed corrective fiscal measures to bring the program back on track. Moreover, the government recently agreed to important policy measures with significant implications for the ongoing comprehensive revamping of the poverty reduction strategy. These measures would enhance the participatory process and facilitate preparation of an interim PRSP before the end of the year, and a full-fledged PRSP during 200 1.

The revised program for the balance of 2000 appropriately aims at strengthening the key sectors of the economy, public finances, and the external position, starting with a number of prior actions. It also focuses on strengthening structural reforms to improve the environment for private sector activity and to enhance the delivery and monitoring of public services. These measures are essential to restore macroeconomic stability and contribute to a lasting reduction in poverty in The Gambia. Accordingly, to realize the above objectives, it is crucial that the authorities maintain the implementation of, beyond those already taken, the following determined policy actions: 39. The authorities need to strengthen governance, including expeditious settlement of the GGC dispute, and timely implementation of the comprehensive governance reform program adopted by the government. The latter, in particular, provides for several initiatives that are critical for broadening the participatory process in the PRSP. The staff welcomes these measures and urges the authorities to continue to actively seek broad consultations in implementing them. 40. Fiscal performance should be strengthened in line with the revised program and move toward a sustainable level of government domestic debt. On the revenue side, the reduced external tariff and reliance on taxes on international trade is a welcome development, but success will depend also on concerted measures to improve the coordination and efficiency of the tax departments, including through the computerization process. On the expenditure side, the challenge remains to complete the reforms initiated with Fund technical assistance to improve expenditure reporting and control. 41. The pursuit of prudent monetary policy, while providing adequate private sector credit growth, remains important to maintain the low level of inflation. Emphasis should continue to be on controlling reserve money growth through an improved and expanded use of indirect instruments, taking advantage of Fund technical assistance. The staff welcomes the progress that has been made by the central bank in introducing the liquidity forecasting framework and urges further progress in this area, taking advantage of the improving control and monitoring of treasury accounts. To consolidate and deepen reforms in the financial sector, the authorities should expedite pending legislation to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory roles of the central bank. 42. The staff urges expeditious further implementation of structural reforms, with an emphasis on improving business legislation, including the regulation and privatization of public enterprises. Reforms that will provide for a sustainable marketing arrangement for groundnuts without direct government involvement, as well as measures to enhance activity and employment in the tourism sector, also need to be implemented on a timely basis. 43. The authorities should continue with the good progress being made in the PRSP process. The next steps include updating the poverty reduction strategy to make it more comprehensive and enhancing the delivery and monitoring of public services, especially to the poor. The staff also notes the schedule for completing the interim PRSP and the full- fledged PRSP and urges the authorities to adhere to these target dates.

The staff welcomes the further reduction in the external tariff, which has put The Gambia ahead of the other countries in the region. Moreover, the staff considers the current level of the exchange rate to be broadly appropriate for maintaining the country’s external competitiveness. 45. Now that a preliminary DSA has been completed, the authorities should undertake a closer examination of the possible costs and benefits to determine whether they will seek assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, an option that the staff supports. In light of the preliminary staff analysis showing The Gambia’s likely qualification for assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, Directors may wish to indicate whether they welcome an early preliminary HIPC document seeking their views on the timing of a possible decision point. 46. While noting the progress that has been made in improving economic and financial data and The Gambia’s commitment to participate in the GDDS, the staff urges the authorities to continue their efforts to improve the timeliness and quality of data, especially in the national accounts and prices, fiscal, balance of payments, social, and poverty areas. While the provision of data to the Fund does not prevent effective surveillance or program monitoring, the delays in reporting and the quality of the data need significant improvement to facilitate the analysis of economic developments. 47. Possible risks to implementation of the program include further delays in addressing problems related to governance and lack of transparency. At the same time, the heavy burden of implementing the broad range of the program measures will be a major test of the limited economic management capacity in the country. In this context, the staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to intensify collaboration with donors, including the Fund, to ensure timely access to technical assistance. 48. The staff notes the encouraging economic developments through the early part of the year and welcomes the corrective measures that the authorities have taken so far to bring the program back on track. On this basis, and on the strength of the program for the balance of 2000, as described in the attached letter of intent, the staff recommends the completion of the first review under the second annual PRGF arrangement and approval by the Executive Board of the request for the waivers on the nonobservance of the three performance criteria. 49. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with The Gambia be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Washington D.C. 2043 1 U.S.A. Dear Mr. KShler: 1. In the context of its continued reform efforts to promote economic growth and poverty alleviation, the government of The Gambia adopted a medium-term economic and financial program (April 1,1998-March 3 1,200 l), supported under a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PGRF).’ This letter, which supplements our letter of November 8, 1999, reviews performance under the first half of the second annual PRGF arrangement approved by the Executive Board on November 19,1999 (EBS/99/201; 1 l/8/99, Correction 1). It also outlines the government’s objectives and policies for the balance of 2000. Against this background, it notes that most of the quantitative performance criteria for end-March 2000 and all of the structural performance criteria were observed and requests waivers for the nonobservance of the end-March 2000 quantitative criteria with respect to (a) net bank credit to the central government; (b) net domestic assets of the central bank, and (c) basic primary balance of the central government (see para. 6). 2. The government is aware that overall performance under the second year PRGF- supported program has so far been mixed. Notwithstanding robust real GDP growth with low inflation and good progress in implementing a number of structural reforms, there were budgetary slippages during the fourth quarter of 1999 through the first quarter of 2000. The government is therefore determined to consolidate the overall economic gains made in 1999 and so far in 2000 and undertake corrective measures to address the policy slippages in order to achieve strong momentum toward realizing its medium-term economic and financial objectives. In fact, significant progress has already been made in implementing corrective measures, including structural reforms and the posting of a long-term Fund budget advisor to Banjul to strengthen budget implementation. 3. In 1999, real GDP growth, estimated at 5.6 percent, exceeded the program target. There was better performance across the board, especially in tourism with an estimated growth of 34 percent in visitors. In agriculture, good rains contributed to an increase of 67 percent in groundnut production, to about 123,000 metric tons, while production of other ’ By the decision of the IMF Executive Board in November 1999, the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility(ESAF) was replaced by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).

The good harvest in 1999 contributed to a moderation in the end-of-period inflation (based on the low-income consumer price index) to below the program target of 2 percent. The decline in imports following the introduction of the preshipment inspection scheme (see below) and the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate of the dalasi by 2.3 percent, contributed to a lower external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) of about 10% percent of GDP during 1999, compared with 11% percent in 1998. Gross official reserves were below the end-1999 target by SDR 4.3 million, but the end-March 2000 quantitative performance criterion with respect to the floor on the net foreign assets of the central bank was observed as the central bank curtailed its intervention in the foreign exchange market. 4. Budget implementation during 1999 suffered a number of setbacks despite the introduction of midyear measures to consolidate the fiscal deficit. Instead, the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) increased to 4.8 percent of GDP compared with the program target of 3.1 percent. The original budget for 1999 was subsequently weakened by the larger-than- envisaged adverse revenue impact of a reduction in the maximum import duty rate to 20 percent effective January 1, 1999, and by a cut in petroleum product prices aimed at passing through the decline in world market prices. To rectify this, the government adopted supplementary measures in June to strengthen customs revenue collection and contain recurrent expenditure. However, there was a subsequent shortfall in revenue from customs duty and sales tax on imports during the fourth quarter equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP, following the introduction of the preshipment inspection scheme on imports in October 1999.* On the expenditure side, the wage bill for 1999 slightly exceeded the target because of higher payments for statutory gratuities, pensions, and the hiring of new teachers. Overall, other recurrent expenditures exceeded the program target by D 46 million (0.9 percent of GDP), including additional domestic interest payments. Thus, net government borrowing from the banking system exceeded the program target by an equivalent of 4% percent of the beginning-of-the-period money stock. 5. Domestic credit expansion, both to the government and the private sector, exceeded the program targets significantly by end-December 1999 and through end-March 2000. The growth in private sector credit during the first quarter of 2000 was entirely accounted for by fmancing.of the marketing of the groundnut crop, as credit to the rest of the private sector declined by 3 percent. Attempts by the central bank to mop up commercial banks’ excess reserves were not effective. The treasury bill rate declined from 14 percent in December 1998 to 12 percent by end-March 2000, broadly in line with the decline in inflation during the same period. 2 A preshipment inspection scheme was introduced at the government’s initiative on a six- months trial basis. In the event, BIVAC introduced the scheme without adequate preparation, and administrative delays and high charges (1.4 percent of c.i.f. value or a minimum of US$250, without exemptions) adversely affected imports and reexports.

The quantitative performance criteria for end-March 2000 with respect to net bank credit to the central government, net domestic assets of the central bank, and the basic primary balance of the central government were not observed (Table 1) largely as a result of the fiscal slippages in the fourth quarter of 1999 and the mid-March salary advance to civil servants3 However, the implementation of structural measures was encouraging. In particular, a comprehensive survey of government arrears as of end-June 1999 and end-December 1999 was completed, earlier than programmed, by mid-February, while the reconciliation of the Treasury accounts from September 1997 to December 1999 with those of the central bank was completed ahead of schedule by end-March 2000 (Table 2). 7. Other key reforms are generally on schedule (Table 2). The original budget for 2000 incorporated a reduction in the maximum external tariff from 20 percent to 18 percent, effective from July 1,2000, and the customs department has been working out details to reduce the number of tariff brackets from eight to three as envisaged in the program. The budget also provided for an average 20 percent increase in petroleum product prices, effective January 1,2000, and granted the Secretary of State for Finance the flexibility to adjust the petroleum product prices on the basis of an existing formula without going back to parliament. The government privatized the Atlantic Hotel in December 1999 and sold the Trust Bank Building in February 2000. In response to the late 1999 crisis with groundnut marketing, the government reached agreement with the European Union (EU) on the details for the financing of the 1999/2000 groundnut crop without any direct government involvement, while providing for EU to reimburse a part of the marketing costs. Macroeconomic and budgetary framework for the balance of 2000 8. The outlook for 2000 has been dimmed by a sharp decline in tourist arrivals- originally triggered by the year-2000 (Y2K) anxieties in late December 1999~and the weakness in the distributive trade sector as a result of the preshipment exercise.4 There have also been problems in marketing the large groundnut crop from 1999, with delays in evacuating the crop, and paying farmers, and some reluctance by domestic banks to continue participating in crop financing. On this basis, real GDP growth is projected to ease to just below 5 percent during 2000. Measured inflation is projected to continue at below 3 percent. 3 In March 2000, the government awarded a one-month salary advance of D 19.8 million to civil servants for the Tabaski religious festival, which was not discussed with the staff in September 1999 for incorporation into the program. While this advance had an adverse impact on the end-March quantitative performance criteria, it should not significantly affect the 2000 budget outturn, as repayments are effected through automatic salary deductions and should be completed by end-September 2000. 4 The slow tourism recovery in 2000 also reflects concerns arising from civil disturbances during the period through April 2000.

The fiscal program for 2000 was revised to take account of recent developments. Thus, even though the budget for 2000 (approved by parliament on January 5) incorporated revenue measures equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP in excess of the program target, policy slippages during the fourth quarter of 1999 and other developments adversely affected the overall budgetary projections for 2000.’ Accordingly, the original budget projections for 2000 were revised to reflect (a) lower customs duty receipts (D 48 million or 0.9 percent of GDP) as a result of the adverse impact of preshipment inspection; (b) lower domestic sales tax owing to the lower hotel occupancy so far in 2000, the likely summer closure of a number of hotels, and the damage to the Gambia Telecommunications Company Limited (GAMTEL) property during the students’ riots in April; (c) higher wages and salaries to cover the hiring of, and double shifts for, teachers; and (d) higher other recurrent expenditures, including domestic interest payments, to provide for growing public services and the timely discharge of government payments. With these changes, the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) would reach 3.8 percent of GDP and give rise to considerable government borrowing from the banking system. 10. In order to address the deteriorating fiscal situation and restore macroeconomic stability, the government has implemented revenue measures amounting to D 65.7 million (1.2 percent of GDP), of which D 15.7 million was covered by the further increase in diesel prices (8 percent) and an average 28 percent increase in the duty free prices of petroleum products effective February 2000. The remaining gap has been tilled by (a) abolishing the preshipment inspection scheme effective July 1,200O leading to an estimated recovery of D 30 million in customs duty; and (b) selling the Kombo Beach and Mariatou hotels, thereby permitting the government to recover an estimated D 20 million in tax arrears. With these measures, the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) will be brought back to 2.6 percent of GDP, with net government repayment to the banking system estimated at 0.8 percent of GDP, both largely in line with the original program. 11. To supplement these measures, the government has accelerated budgetary reforms to improve performance. On the revenue side, in addition to the external tariff reforms, the customs department will complete the implementation of the automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA) in July 2000. Further steps have been taken to improve coordination between the revenue departments and to effect the timely reconciliation of their accounts with those of the central bank in order to facilitate revenue collection. Moreover, the government is discussing with the World Bank a capacity-building project under which they could receive long-term technical assistance to strengthen the Central Revenue Department. 5 The program had provided for an average 6 percent increase in the domestic petroleum product prices, while the 2000 budget raised these prices by an average of 20 percent. The budget also incorporated miscellaneous nontax measures, which accounted for the balance of the revenue in excess of those in the program target. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - APPENDIX I On the expenditure side, the government issued a circular on May 10 providing for a reform in the accounting practices that would permit comprehensive reporting and control of government expenditure, especially on the “below-the-line (BTL) accounts” that have proliferated over the years. Timely information on these accounts will also allow faster reconciliation of treasury and central bank accounts, which, in turn, will facilitate macroeconomic policy coordination. The Fund long-term budget expert expected to return to Banjul in July should play a key role in these and other reforms to strengthen institutional capacity. 12. Furthermore, the government is implementing measures to deal firmly with the reemergence of the cross arrears of the government and the public enterprises, which had been cleared in 1998. As of end-December 1999, the government had accumulated arrears of D 26 million (0.5 percent of GDP) to public enterprises, while the latter had accumulated an estimated D 21 million in arrears to the government. A program for the mutual settlement of these arrears, with quarterly targets leading to their elimination by end-2000, is being implemented. 13. A key objective of monetary policy during 2000 is to maintain low inflation and strengthen external reserves. To these ends, the government will pursue sustained prudent fiscal policies, and a tight monetary policy (while providing adequate credit to the private sector), and promote greater exchange rate flexibility, consistent with a further buildup of official reserves. Accordingly, through sales of securities, the central bank will seek to moderate the growth of broad money from an estimated 24 percent at end-March 2000 to below 12% percent by end-2000. In a broader context, the participation of smaller banks in the financing of the marketing of the 1999/2000 groundnut crop reflects the greater competition that is developing in the banking system. This development, in turn, should benefit the arrangements that are being made to finalize the setting up of a short-term liquidity forecasting system as well as the related arrangements to transform the Treasury Bill Committee into an Open Market Operations Committee, supported by the May 2000 technical assistance provided by a short-term Fund expert. 14. The central bank is undertaking various measures to. strengthen its regulatory and supervisory role over the financial sector. These include the finalization of the Financial Institutions Act and the Insurance Act for their expected July presentation for parliamentary approval. With the benefit of Fund technical assistance, further progress has been made in preparing for the introduction of foreign currency deposits and improving the reporting of financial data (monetary and balance of payments). The monetary authorities will ensure that banks maintain full provisioning for nonperforming loans and maintain their capital adequacy ratio above the legal requirement of 8 percent. 15. In April 2000, The Gambia, together with five other countries in West Africa,6 signed the “Accra Declaration” to establish a common currency region by 2003. The primary 6 The other countries are Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-41- APPENDIX I convergence criteria specify that the six countries must achieve inflation of under 10 percent by 2000 and 5 percent by 2003 in a “fast-track” program to create a single currency. Other criteria include a foreign currency reserve cover target of at least three months of imports by end-2000 and six months by end-2003; a limit on central bank financing of the budget deficit of 10 percent of the previous year’s tax revenue; and a budget deficit (excluding grants) target of 5 percent of GDP by 2000 and 4 percent by 2002. Details of the specific measures that will need to be coordinated to achieve these targets have yet to be discussed and agreed by the relevant authorities. Structural and sectoral policies 16. The modemization of business-related legislation and regulation needs to be speeded up, and the government is pushing for additional reforms in the judicial system to reduce the backlog of court cases, including those in the commercial branch of the high court, by increasing the number of high court judges by 50 percent by October 2000 to facilitate the opening of four regional courts. Following the October 1999 cabinet approval of an interim procurement code to enhance transparency and efficiency in government purchases, the government is taking steps to expedite access to technical assistance in order to complete the drafting of a new comprehensive code that meets the latest international standards. Pending a comprehensive tax reform, the government has drafted an interim Investment Bill-currently under review in the Department of State for Justice-which will also provide the legal framework for the export processing zone that is to be supported by the proposed World Bank Trade Gateway project. During May 2000, the government initiated discussions with the Commonwealth Secretariat, with the aim of developing a competition policy, and eventually drafting a Competition Bill, to provide an environment that is conducive to competitive business activities. 17. Regarding the public enterprise sector, the Privatization Agency Bill, which was submitted to the cabinet in April 2000 and will be submitted to parliament for approval in June 2000, provides for the establishment of an agency that will oversee privatization. This bill duly recognizes the existence of a divestiture account at the central bank into which the government intends to deposit the proceeds from privatization. In 2000, a minimum of D 24 million will be transferred from the divestiture account to pay some of the government’s domestic debt. In the meantime, the government intends to rigorously implement the terms of the memoranda of understandings (MOUs) that were agreed upon with a number of public enterprises in 1998. Thus, the government will take the necessary measures to prevent any further accumulation of payment-arrears, and insist that all public enterprises fully meet their tax, debt-service, and dividend obligations. With regard to GAMTEL, in April 2000, the cabinet decided to separate GAMTEL’s broadcasting activities from the telecommunications business as a first step toward privatizing the enterprise. 18. In agriculture, implementing the institutional reforms in the marketing arrangements of the groundnut crop to replace the ad hoc arrangements during 1999/2000 remain a priority. In,this regard, the government intends to continue to work with the EU and the Agri-Business Service Plan Association (ASPA), comprising farmers and buyers, to improve the marketing - of.the groundnuts and encourage ASPA to adhere to a schedule to publicly announce Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-42- APPENDIX I producer prices early in the planting season; timely crop financing arrangements will also be promoted. The government intends to make timely arrangements to provide suitably improved seed varieties, and fertilizer and credit facilities, the latter through the IFAD Rural Finance and Community Initiative. Significant support for the fishing sector will be provided by projects, funded by some US$8 million, to build cold storage and artisanal facilities in The Gambia. 19. With regard to governance, in March 2000, the government held a roundtable meeting on governance in Banjul, and committed itself to (a) strengthening the constitutional and electoral processes; (b) strengthening the parliamentary structures and processes; (c) promoting civic education and enhancing civil participation in the political process (d) improving the legal and judicial processes; (e) decentralizing and reforming the local government system; and (f) improving the management and transparency of public finances. Within this broader framework, the government has continued to seek the settlement of the seizure of the Gambia Groundnut Corporation with its parent company, Alimenta. Senior government officials met with Alimenta’s representatives in Geneva in February 2000, and the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) held its first meeting on this dispute in March 2000; bilateral contacts are continuing to expedite settlement of the matter. External sector policies 20. On the basis of the economic policies detailed above, the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected to narrow slightly to about 10% percent of GDP in 2000. The volume of total exports (including reexports) is$rojected to increase by about 15 percent, reflecting a recovery in groundnut production, Ii&exports, and the reexport trade. It is also expected that the groundnut exports will contain a larger proportion of high-quality nuts. Import volumes are projected to grow by about 7 percent largely because of the recovery in the reexport trade following the removal of the preshipment inspection scheme and the reduction in the external tariff. The terms of trade are projected to remain virtually unchanged in 2000. Receipts from tourism are projected to decline by 6 percent because of the anticipated low summer activity. Assistance from donors is projected to increase, resulting in an increase of gross official reserves of SDR 9.8 million in 2000 to a level equivalent to about six months of import cover. 21. The government remains committed to a liberal trade and exchange system. To this end, it will further reduce the external tariff to a maximum rate of 18 percent effective July 1, 2000 and number of bands in the tariff system f?om eight to three, thereby cutting the import- weighted average tariff rate from 12 percent to 11.8 percent (neutral revenue scenario). These measures, together with the pursuit of a market-based flexible exchange rate, should benefit The Gambia’s external competitiveness and facilitate the recovery in the important reexport trade. To further improve its debt-service profile, The Gambia will need to continue to manage its external debt prudently and rely exclusively on external grants or long-term loans on highly concessional terms. Moreover, the government will continue to meet its external debt-service obligations in a timely manner. It has also made progress in collaborating with the Fund staff in improving the data that will be used for the debt Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-43- APPENDIX I sustainability analysis (DSA) in order to assess The Gambia’s eligibility under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and looks forward to a favorable outcome. Meanwhile, it is expected that by August 2000 agreement will be reached on the debt owed to the Norwegian export guarantee agency arising from a government-guaranteed loan to the Senegambia Beach Hotel. Social and poverty reduction policies 22. On May 8, the government convened a meeting on the poverty reduction strategy (PRS) and the PRSP process for donors and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Banjul. The discussion focused on (a) the role of the World Bank, the Fund, donors, and NGOs in facilitating the PRSP process; (b) preparations for the various intermediate steps, such as the organization of participating fora and a donor roundtable meeting on the poverty reduction strategy; (c) the establishment of a task force (including government agencies, donors, representatives of the private sector, and NGOs) to oversee the work of the Strategy for Poverty Alleviation Coordination Office (SPACE) in coordinating the National Poverty Alleviation Program (NPAP) and the various aspects of the PRSP process; and (d) the reactivation of the High-Level Economic Coordinating Committee (HILEC) to oversee the NPAP. During the meeting, SPACO elaborated upon its ongoing efforts to update the NPAP based on a number of studies, including the first annual report on the Participatory Poverty Assessment (PPA). The PPA, in particular, should provide community action programs that are expected to be incorporated in the NPAP. The government has received favorable commitments from donors and NGOs to support its efforts in this area through December 2000. These contributions, along with output from other sources; :should inform the interim PRSP, expected by the last quarter of 2000, while a full PRSP is planned for mid-2001. The updating of the comprehensive poverty reduction strategy will pla@ a considerable burden on institutional capacity and necessitate further reforms to improve the delivery and monitoring of enhanced public services. In this regard, the government intends to intensify collaboration with donors, including the Fund, to ensure timely access to technical assistance, Statistical issues 23. The Gambia’s economic and financial statistics remain in need of improvement, especially with regard to the major components of the balance of payments, the national accounts and prices, public investment, the public enterprise sector, and employment. The government has benefited from the recommendations of various recent Fund-technical assistance missions to strengthen the compilation of economic data, including (a) the establishment of a balance of payments-unit in the central bank and the improved bank and financial sector reporting of balance of payments and monetary data; (b) the proposed rebasing of the national income accounts to a more recent date than the prevailing 1976/77, base year; (c) the proposed household expenditure survey to provide a basis for the compilation of a comprehensive price index; (d) the full implementation of ASYCUDA, inter alia, to improve balance of payments data compilation; and (e) the participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and use of the framework it provides to improve the quality, timeliness, and transparency of data provision. The Gambia has also benefited from recent Fund and World Bank technical assistance to strengthen the external - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-44- APPENDIX I debt data. While these steps are likely to yield significant improvements, the government faces much greater challenges in meeting the broader quality data essential for successful pursuit of an enhanced poverty reduction strategy and it is determined to intensify efforts towards this endeavor. Program monitoring and review 24. To monitor policy implementation under the program, prior actions and a number of quantitative benchmarks have been set, the latter for end-June 2000, as well as quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks for end-September 2000 (see Table 1). The prior actions entail (a) the setting up of a monitoring program for the payment of government arrears to public enterprises and the observation of the end-June 2000 target leading to the elimination of such arrears by end-2000; (b) issuance of a government circular to curtail the creation of BTL accounts (which lack reporting and control measures) and to impose monitoring and control safeguards on existing BTL accounts and; (c) abolition of the preshipment inspection scheme. The proposed benchmarks will comprise the following: (a) a ceiling on net bank credit to the government; (b) a ceiling on net domestic assets of the central bank, (c) a ceiling on the basic primary balance of the central government, defined to exclude interest payments and foreign financial investment spending; (d) the nonaccumulation of external payments-arrears; (e) a minimum level of net official international reserves; (f) a limit on new nonconcessional external loans contracted or guaranteed by the government in the maturity ranges of l-5 years and 1-12 years; and (g) a zero ceiling on the outstanding stock of short-term external public debt (excluding normal import-related credits). The nonaccumulation of external payments arrears will be applied on a continuous basis. Limits on items (a)-(g) above for end-September 2000 will serve as quantitative performance criteria. In addition, the reform measures indicated in Table 2 have been adopted as structural benchmarks for the second half of the year. 25. The government believes that the policies described in this letter are adequate to achieve the objectives of the economic and financial during 2000 but will, if necessary, take any further measures deemed appropriate for this purpose. During the remaining period of the second annual PRGF arrangement, The Gambia will continue to consult with the Managing Director on the adoption of any measures that may become appropriate, at the initiative of the government or whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation. 26. The government of The Gambia will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requests in connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and achieving the objectives of the program. 27. The government of The Gambia intends to make these understandings public and authorizes you to arrange for this document to be posted on the IMF website, subsequent to Board approval.

The Gambia, which has a low per capita income of US$340 (1997) and a significant amount of external debt, has neither resorted to concessional rescheduling fi-om the Paris Club nor fully utilized traditional debt-relief mechanisms.2 The previous debt sustainability analysis (DSA), undertaken in June 1998 (EBS/98/102; 6/15/98), concluded that The Gambia would not exceed the then-required threshold levels after exhausting traditional debt-relief mechanisms. At the time, it was also concluded that, with continued reliance on grants and highly concessional borrowings, the country’s debt-service obligation would remain sustainable. Since then, modifications were introduced in the enhanced HIPC Initiative, including the lowering of the net present value of debt targets for the export and fiscal criteria, to 150 percent and 250 percent, respectively. On a preliminary basis, the DSA carried out in this appendix concludes that The Gambia would exceed the required targets under both the export and fiscal windows,3 even’ after exhausting the traditional debt-relief mechanisms. It also meets the qualifying thresholds (the export-to-GDP ratio and the revenue-to-GDP ratio). These debt ratios indicate that The Gambia could qualify for assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in order to achieve sustainable debt-service obligations. 2. Compared with the June 1998 DSA, the present analysis shows a smaller stock of debt both in nominal terms and in net present value terms for end-2000. This is most likely the result of a more complete debt-reconciliation exercise, which eliminated duplication of reported loans, and because of the disaggregated loan-by-loan approach, under this approach, the calculations are based on somewhat different currencies, exchange rates, and discount rates, used in the exercise. The ratios of debt stock to exports are significantly different due to adjustments on the treatment of reexport trade. The debt-service ratio in percent of government revenue is also higher than in the previous exercise for 2000, owing to the adverse impact of the introduction of presbipment inspection on imports and customs revenue in October 1999. ’ This debt sustainability analysis reflects comments from the World Bank staff. The present analysis is based on a loan-by-loan approach and differs fi-om the approach in EBS/98/102, which used aggregated loan data. As in the previous case, the exercise is based on a comprehensive database provided by the Department of State for Finance and Economic Affairs containing updated information on 252 separate loan agreements. The computerized database was installed with technical assistance from the Commonwealth Secretariat and a consultant financed by the World Bank. 2 The Gambia had one Paris Club rescheduling in 1986 on nonconcessional terms. 3 For the purpose of debt sustainability analysis, revisions were made to the treatment of reexport trade. See Box 6. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-48 - APPENDIX II Box 6. Revisions Made to the Export Data The reexport trade through The Gambia to neighboring countries, especially to Senegal, constitute a substantial part of The Gambia’s export earnings. However, as reexport does not involve a change in ownership vis-&is residents of The Gambia, this trade should not be recorded in balance of payments statistics, as set out in the Balance of Payments Manual (fifth ed.). In compiling the balance of payments data, the Gambian authorities have not been able to ascertain ownership, and record merchandize entering the country as transit goods on the basis of customs data. In view of the above, for the purpose of assessing the eligibility of The Gambia under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, the authorities’ estimates of transit trade is excluded from the export and import figures presented in the balance of payments. The service-related costs of the reexport trade-transportation and insurance-rendered by enterprises in The Gambia as well as their profit have been estimated at 2 1% percent of the value of the transit trade and, hence, are added to the trade in nonfactor service receipts. The adjustments described above reduce total exports of goods and nonfactor services by 41 percent over the period 1998-2000. Thus, the ratio of external debt in NPV terms to exports of goods and nonfactor services was raised from 110 percent to 187 percent for 2000. The level and composition of debt 3. At the end of 1999, The Gambia’s nominal outstanding external debt stock was US$425 million, or 98 percent of GDP, of which US$349 million (82 percent) was owed to multilateral creditors (Table 10). Outstanding Fund credit represented 2% percent of total debt, and debt owed to the World Bank amounted to 40% percent of the total; The remainder of the debt was owed to official bilateral creditors (18 percent), including 8% percent to Taiwan Province of China. All debt-service obligations on rescheduled debt to Paris Club creditors have been fulfilled. 4. Scheduled debt service is estimated at US$17.2 million in 2000, of which US$5.3 million consists of interest obligations (Table 12). Some 70 percent of debt service is due to multilateral creditors. Debt-service obligations in 2000 represent 13 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services and over 20 percent of total government revenue. The Gambia is not expected to receive any debt relief during this period. Main results and assumptions of the baseline scenario 5. A long-term balance of payments scenario was prepared and forms the basis for the external debt indicators presented in Table 13. Real GDP is projected to grow at slightly below 5 percent in 2000 and is assumed to continue to grow at about 5 percent in the outer years.. Under the baseline scenario, the volumes of exports and imports are projected to recover quickly in 2000-01 from the significant decline in 1999, and after 2002 to grow at a moderate rate of about 4 percent for exports and slightly less than 4 percent for imports. Terms of trade (excluding reexports) are projected to improve in 2001, reflecting projected lower world oil prices, and continue to improve, although at very moderate rates, for the entire projection period, owing to the assumed improvement of primary product prices. Meanwhile, the terms of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-49- APPENDIX II trade (including reexports) are projected to remain virtually unchanged. Tourist arrivals are projected to recover by 2001 and grow at 4-5 percent until 2006, and above 2 percent from 2007 onward. Under these assumptions, the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected to improve gradually, narrowing to 9 percent of GDP from the current level of about 10 percent. 6. The reliance on official transfers will decline gradually from slightly less than 7 percent of GDP in 2001 to about 6 percent by the end of the projection period. 7. The debt-service projections were made on the basis of the outstanding public debt at end-December 1999. It is assumed that future contracted debt bears an interest rate of 3h of 1 percent for multilateral creditors and 2 percent for bilateral creditors, with average maturities of 37.5 years for IDA and the African Development Fund (AfDF)P and 23 years for bilateral creditors. Given this baseline scenario, there will be annual financing gaps of ‘/z of 1 percent of GDP on average in 2001-02; the gaps should then drop to zero in 2002. The financing gaps are expected to be covered by mostly grant assistance from donors. 8. Under this scenario, the exports-to-GDP ratio is 30.1 percent for 1999 and 30.2 percent for 2000 and the revenue-to-GDP ratios are 17.7 percent and 19.7 percent for 1999 and 2000, respectively. In either case, these ratios exceed the enhance HIPC Initiative thresholds of 30 percent and 15 percent, respectively. The nominal debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline gradually and approach 90 percent toward the end of the projection period from the current level of slightly over 100 percent. The net present value of debt-to-export ratio is also projected to decline from 193 percent in 1999 and 187 percent in 2000 to less than 180 percent by 2003, and to 138 percent by 2019. The debt-service ratio in percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services is projected to be, on average, about 12% percent during 2000-09, and is expected to decline to 11% percent during 20 lo- 19. 9. After the full application of traditional debt-relief mechanism (i.e., Naples stock-of-debt operation), the net present value is estimated as US$229 million at end-1999 and US$241 million at end-2000, lower by 3.9 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, than before debt-relief mechanism (Tables 10 and 11). Cut of the total net present value of debt stock, 75 percent in 1999 and 70 percent in 2000 was owed to multilateral creditors, with the World Bank having the largest share of 35 and 33 percent, respectively, followed by the African Development Bank (AfDB) groups with 24 percent and 23 percent, respectively. The share of the bilateral creditors is 25 percent and 24 percent, respectively, of which Paris Club creditors are owed only less than 4 percent for both years. 4 The maturities are 37.5 years instead of 40 years because they are based on an “effective” grace period of 7.5 years, assuming that disbursements for each commitment are stretched over 6 years.

This baseline scenario suggests that, even with the continued pursuit of appropriate policies, prudent debt management, and after the full use of traditional debt relief mechanism (Naples stock operation), The Gambia’s net present value of debt-to-export ratio of 186 percent in 1999 and I87 percent in 2000 exceeds the enhanced HIPC target (the net present value of debt-to-export ratio) of 150 percent. Thus, on a preliminary basis, The Gambia could qualify for assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. 11. The net present value of debt-to-revenue ratio, which amounted to 297 percent in 1999, is projected to fall to 287 percent in 2000,272 percent in 2002, and 263 percent in 2004. The ratios remain significantly higher than the HIPC Initiative fiscal target of 250 percent, suggesting that, on a preliminary basis, The Gambia could qualify for assistance also under the fiscal criteria of the enhanced HIPC Initiative. The alternative scenario and sensitivity analysis 12. Two alternative scenarios were prepared to assess the sensitivity of the results described above to lower reexport growth (1.5 percentage points lower than under the baseline scenario) and lower tourist arrivals (% of 1 percentage point lower than under the baseline scenario). Under the lower-reexport scenario, the debt-service ratio will be higher by 0.2 percent point during 2000-09, and by ‘/z of 1 percentage point during 20 lo- 19. Similarly, the net present value of debt-to-export ratio will be higher by 2% percentage points during 2000- 09, and by 6% percentage points during 2010-19. The current account deficit (excluding official transfers) will be widen by % percentage point during 2000-09, and by 3 percentage points during 2010-19.’ Gross official reserves in months of imports are projected to be lower by 3 weeks equivalent during 2000-09, and 4% months during 201 O-19. Under lower-tourism scenario, debt-service ratio will be higher by 0.2 percentage point during 2000-09, and by % of 1 percentage point during 20 lo- 19. Current account deficit in terms of GDP will be higher than the baseline case by ‘/z of 1 percentage point of GDP during 2000-09, and by 2 percentage points of GDP during 2010- 19. Gross official reserves in months of imports will be lower by % month during 2000-09, and 3% months during 2010-19. The net present value of debt-to-export ratio will be higher by 2% percentage points during 2000-09, and by 5% percentage points during 2010-19. Concluding remarks 13. From the above analysi?, The Gambia could qualify for assistance under the enhanced HIPC initiative under both export and fiscal windows.6 Based on this analysis, a full-fledged 5 As explained in the Box, the current account balance takes into account, not only reexport- related service receipt but also customs duties, taxes and profit. Therefore, even after excluding reexport trade, the impact of lower reexport on the current account is significant. 6 Very rougb calculations, which are subject to change, suggest The Gambia could qualify for assistance of around US$40 million based on end-l 999 or end-2000 data.

On January 20, 1986, an interbank market for foreign exchange was introduced, and since then the exchange rate has been determined by market forces. At end- February 2000, the midpoint exchange rate in the interbank market was D 12.0073 per US. dollar. The Gambia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 on January 2 1, 1993. Last Article IV Consultation The 1999 Article IV consultation (SM/99/122; 5/27/99) was concluded by the Executive Board on June 18, 1999. The Gambia is on the standard 12-month cycle for Article IV consultations. Technical assistance A MAE short-term expert visited Banjul in May 2000 to assist the authorities in setting up a short-term liquidity forecasting system. A long-term Fund resident budget expert will assist the authorities in strengthening budgetary expenditure reporting and control from July 2000 through June, 200 1. A STA mission visited The Gambia in November 1999 to review the statistical collection in order to develop General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) metadata for The Gambia. An FAD technical assistance mission-aimed at assisting the authorities in expenditure management, budget execution issues, cash and debt management, short-term financial planning, fiscal reporting, and information systems-visited The Gambia in early September 1999. A technical assistance mission from STA on the balance of payments statistics visited The Gambia in June-July 1999. A technical assistance mission from STA on the national accounts visited The Gambia in November-December 1998. An MAE technical assistance mission took place in August 1998 to assist the Central Bank of The Gambia in developing market-based monetary policy instruments and to review its program for strengthening banking supervision. An MAE technical expert provided assistance in foreign exchange operations to the central bank in December 1996. A joint FAD/United Nations Development Program (UNDP) technical assistance mission took place in January-February 1996 to help establish a system for monitoring the financial operations of public enterprises.

The African Development Bank (AtDB) started lending to The Gambia in 1974. As of June 2000, the AfDB Group2 had provided financial assistance amounting to SDR 168.92 million in support of 38 operations. This assistance consists of five loans from AfDB resources amounting to SDR 2 1.34 million, twenty-two loans totaling SDR 128.58 million from African Development Fund (AfDF) resources, two loans from Nigerian Trust Fund (NTF) resources totaling SDR 6.5 million, and nine grants totaling SDR 12.50 million from the Technical Assistance Fund (TAF) of AfDF resources. 2. The assistance, which has been provided since 1990, includes nine AfDF loans and eight TAF grants. The loans have been provided to finance (a) improvement of the Banjul port infrastructure to meet the handling of increased cargo tonnage; (b) an education project aimed at improving primary teacher training and capacity building in me Ministry of Education; (c) rehabilitation of health-training facilities aimed at strengthening their capacity by expanding and improving the technical skills of students graduating from the School of Public Health and the School of Nursing and Midwifery, as well as at improving primary health care delivery through support to maternal and child health care programs, and training of traditional birth attendants and community health workers; (d) a structural adjustment program in support of policy reforms; (e) a Lowlands Agriculture Development Program aimed at improving food security for the poor smallholder rice growers; (f) a poverty reduction project addressing several aspects of capacity building for the poor and women by strengthening local public services for the poor to grant financing for small-scale projects, and providing loan funds for income-generating activities, particularly women-managed microenterprises; (g) a health sector rehabilitation project aimed at strengthening institutional capacity of the Department of State for Health, Social Welfare and Women’s Affairs at divisional and central levels, thus enhancing the capability to plan, implement, and manage the delivery of improved health care services; (h) a periurban horticultural project aimed at improving horticultural and other income-generating activities of women in the greater Banjul area; and (i) a skills development project geared at increasing economic productivity of rural women in the villages (WID II). The grants were provided for (a) institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Works and Communications and carrying out of a feasibility study for an eastern road link (Essau-Farafenni Road); (b) a skills development project (WID I) geared at improving economic productivity of rural women; (c) a technical assistance component of the skills development project mentioned above (WID III); (d) feasibility studies for rural electrification and livestock development; (e) a health services requirements study undertaking a comprehensive analysis of requirements for more efficient and cost-effective health care delivery services; (f) a coastal protection study to examine the extent of sea encroachment and degradation of the coastline in Banjul and recommend mitigation measures; and (g) a capacity-building operation to strengthen the project and debt- management capability of the Department of State for Finance and increase the supply of ’ Prepared by AfDB staff. * The AfDB Group consists of the African Development Bank, African Development Fund, and the Nigerian _ Trust Fund.

The AfDB Group lending strategy for the Gambia recognizes the poverty pervading the Gambian population, the shortage of administrative and managerial skills, and the need to develop private sector activity. Thus for the ADF VIII Programming Cycle (1999-2001), the Bank Group will pursue a lending strategy that supports the government implementation of a comprehensive social program within its overall development agenda. The strategy includes provision of assistance directed at poverty reduction and pursuance of economic and administrative reforms to promote private sector participation. Assistance for poverty reduction efforts will be carried out through direct pro-poor interventions via new operations in the agriculture and social sectors and rural infrastructure; and analytical and financial support for diversifying the economy and increasing private sector involvement in new economic activities, in order to speed up job creation.

Instruments used in supporting these objectives have been adjustment lending (structural adjustment credits I and II), buttressed by sector-based rehabilitation and investment projects. 2. In addition to SAL II, which provided a global framework for IDA’s support to the policy reforms, IDA financed other projects in support of policy and institutional reforms. Under the Enterprise Development Project, there was a marked progress in promoting private sector investment in small and medium-scale activities (by privatizing and restructuring public enterprises, upgrading the management contract system, and improving financial performance of several public enterprises, and of the financial sector, partly through the privatization of The Gambian Commercial and Development Bank). The promotion of extension and other agricultural services under the Agricultural Development II Project yielded positive results. These results have been %rther strengthened through the Agricultural Services Project, which closed on March 1, 1999. Past projects in the transport, utility, and urban sectors promoted private sector activities by improving maintenance and rehabilitation of infrastructure, and by rendering better services with a more efftcient use of public resources. Projects in the human resources sector were designed to help the government: (a) improve the quality of primary education and raise school enrollment under the Education Sector Project; (b) improve family planning programs (by increasing access to health care and raising the efficiency of health services under the National Health Development Project); and (c) promote women’s role in socioeconomic development under the Women in Development Project. 3. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for The Gambia, endorsed by the Board on September 10, 1998, is being implemented with vigor. 4. The government and IDA conducted a Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) in June 1999. The CPPR meeting reviewed progress on all projects in the portfolio; identified weaknesses and strengths of each project; and agreed on a plan of action to improve implementation of projects. 5. As of February 29,2000, IDA had approved 25 projects for The Gambia for a total amount of about US$224.8 million, with an undisbursed amount of about US$47 million. The current portfolio consists of three projects (Participatory Health/Population/Nutrition, Third Education, and Poverty Alleviation & Municipal Development) totaling US$53 million. IDA’s lending will continue to build around poverty reduction and capacity building through various operations: Third Education and Poverty Alleviation and Municipal Development Projects approved in FY 99; Trade Gateway/Ports Project for FY 2000; and Energy Infrastructure, Capacity Building for Economic Management, and Gateway Projects for FY 2001. 6. As of February 29,2000, IFC’s portfolio had three investments with a balance of about US!§O.61 million. The current portfolio includes investments under the African Enterprise Facility (AEF) for a medical clinic (Ndebaan), commercial fishing (Lyefish), and an agribusiness (Radville). The establishment of the AEF has enhanced IFC’s ability to reach smaller businesses, such as those currently in operation in The Gambia. 7. IDA and IFC will continue to coordinate their respective roles to support development activities in The Gambia. This is being enhanced by the IFC’s office in Dakar, which also oversees the IFC’s activities-in The Gambia.

There are substantial weaknesses in The Gambia’s economic and financial statistics, especially in the national accounts, balance of payments, and external debt statistics. Although these weaknesses do not preclude a meaningful assessment of economic policies, the reporting delays and poor quality of some of the data hamper the analysis of recent economic developments. The authorities have recently provided most core data to the Fund in a timely manner. Available data are published in the central bank’s quarterly bulletins and the Central Statistics Department’s (CSD) publications. The Gambia has volunteered to serve as a General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) pilot country. In November 1999, a STA technical mission prepared a detailed report on the status of the Gambian statistics, which the authorities are implementing to develop the GDDS metadata. Real sector 2. Annual national accounts data are only available from the production side and have been produced with a long lag. The breakdown by expenditure category is largely estimated by Fund staff. Reliable information on employment and labor costs is not available. An STA technical expert provided assistance on national accounts in November-December 1998. During 2000, the authorities will publish documentation on sources and methods used in the current series of GDP by kind of economic activity. Also, the publication of national accounts for fiscal years 1995196 and 1996/97 and calendar years 1997 and 1998, will be completed by year-end. For the medium term, the plans for improvements are: (i) to move base year from 1976/77 to a more recent year; (ii) to provide estihates of private final consumption; and (iii) to change the framework of national accounts from 1968 UN Standard to 1993 UN Standard. ‘\ 3. A new consumer price index (with a base of July 1994-June 1995) for the low- and middle-income population in the greater Banjul area has been produced, using new weights from the 1992/93 household expenditure survey. To ensure a smooth transition, the CSD will compile both the old and new indices for two years; the old consumer price index is based on the 1968/69 household survey. At present, however, the CSD only publishes data using the old weights. During 2000, it will conduct a new household budget survey to update the structure of the CPI index. Government finance 4. The authorities provide the staff with current information on central government revenue and expenditures. Data on domestic government financing are also available on a monthly basis with a short lag. The three-year rolling public investment program has not been updated for some time, and the execution of public investment needs closer monitoring. The staff was provided with detailed information on foreign-financed extrabudgetary expenditures carried out after the July 1994 military coup. The latest annual data reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and 1nteematiom.d Financial Statistics (IFS) correspond to 1993.

Monthly balance sheet data of the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) are available within two weeks after the end of the reference month, and the monetary survey with a lag of one month. The coverage of banks in the monetary survey is comprehensive, and the banks follow a uniform chart of accounts to report financial data to the CBG. Flash reports of key monetary data are also sent from the banks to the CBG on a weekly basis. Over the past two years, the CBG has introduced several reclassifications to the monetary accounts in an attempt to improve sectorization and coverage, as well as to harmonize the data reported to STA and AFR. A money and banking statistics mission is tentatively scheduled to take place in FY 2001. Balance of payments 6. The Gambia’s external transactions are characterized by a large volume of activity in the informal sector. For example, the bulk of the reexport trade is unrecorded. Therefore, balance of payment statistics have to be supplemented by estimates of activity in the informal sector. The central bank estimates reexports as a fixed share of total imports. Tourism revenue is estimated based on tourist arrival data from the relevant ministry. Data on private capital flows are poor, mainly because survey data are nonexistent. Data on official grants and loan disbursements and repayments are relatively good. Data on the gross and net international reserves of the central bank are available with a short lag. Coordination and cooperation among the main statistical agencies need to be strengthened to improve the quality of balance of payments statistics; since an STA technical expert provided assistance on the balance of payments statistics in June-July 1999, it is expected that these issues will be addressed in the near future. A follow-up technical assistance mission from STA is tentatively scheduled for the later part of 2000. 7. The CBG recently established a balance of payments unit equipped with computer resources. The government has embarked on the computerization of its database on the stock of external public debt and the related debt-service obligations, using the Commonwealth Secretariat’s debt-reporting and management system. The World Bank is providing technical assistance to ensure that a comprehensive data management and reporting system is in place.

C. 20431 USA Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 001 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with The Gambia On July 19, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with The Gambia.’ Background Overall economic performance in The Gambia during 1999 and the early part of 2000 was mixed. The country made important gains in implementing economic and structural reforms, which were supported by the second annual arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PGRF). The economy benefited from robust real GDP growth with low inflation, while important reforms, including a further reduction in external tariff, increase in petroleum product prices, privatization of public enterprises, and improvements in budgetary expenditure reporting and control, were implemented. However, there were policy slippages in implementing the government budget through the first quarter of 2000. Through mid-2000, the government implemented corrective budgetary measures, that are expected to bring fiscal performance back on track to a sustainable level of the deficit and net government borrowing from the banking system. This outcome should also make it feasible to maintain a prudent monetary policy for the year and permit further improvement in the external sector. In 1999, real GDP growth increased to 5.6 percent from about 5 percent in 1998, with favorable weather contributing to a strong recovery in agricultural production to complement a robust ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

The good harvest in 1999 also helped to contain the end-of- period inflation (based on the low-income consumer price index) below the program target of 2 percent. The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is estimated to have declined to 10% percent of GDP in 1999 from 11% percent in 1998, mainly because of lower imports following the introduction of a preshipment inspection scheme effective October 1999 and the 2.5 percent depreciation of the real effective exchange rate of the dalasi. The overall balance of payments surplus moderated somewhat as private capital inflows declined; gross official reserves increased only slightly to SDR 78 million at the end of 1999, providing the equivalent of about six months of import cover. The implementation of the budget was problematic during 1999 as the favorable impact of the midyear corrective measures was subsequently more than offset by a shortfall in customs receipts during the fourth quarter following the introduction of a preshipment inspection scheme. Consequently, the overall deficit (on a commitment basis and excluding grants) increased to 4.8 percent of GDP and was significantly above the target for the year. The deficit including grants, at 3.5 percent of GDP, exceeded the program target and was also higher than in 1998. Total government revenue decreased as a ratio to GDP to 17% percent, as lower customs receipts more than offset the increase in nontax revenue. Effective January 1, 1999, the maximum import tariff rate was reduced to 20 percent, and the tariff bands were reduced from 18 to 8. On the expenditure side, other recurrent expenditure, including on domestic interest payments, exceeded the target by about 1 percent of GDP. Monetary policy was largely accommodating as domestic credit expansion, both to the government and the private sector, exceeded the targets through end-March 2000. Efforts by the central bank to mop up commercial banks’ excess reserves through sales of securities were largely unsuccessful as banks’ excess reserves increased slightly through end-March 2000. Moreover, the treasury bill rate declined from 14 percent in December 1998 to 12 percent by end-March 2000, broadly in line with the decline in inflation over the same period. A number of reforms were implemented to strengthen budgetary performance, including the identification of, and measures to pay off, government arrears and the introduction of reporting and control safeguards on all government expenditure. The preshipment inspection scheme was abolished effective July 2000. In addition, petroleum product prices were increased, there was a further privatization of public enterprises, and the interim groundnut marketing arrangements were made with donor assistance, excluding direct government involvement. The government has also prepared several pieces of legislation, which are awaiting parliamentary approved, to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory role of the central bank in the financial sector, establish an updated legal basis for business incentives and privatization, and enhance competition in the private sector. Moreover, the government approved a comprehensive governance reform program in March 2000, that targets judicial reforms, government decentralization, and civic education, all designed to facilitate the planned broad- based participation in the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) process. An interim PRSP is planned for end-2000 and a full-fledged PRSP by end-2001.
