Introduction .The discussions for the 1995 Article-IV'consultation with Uganda and the midterm review of the first annual arrangement under the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) took place during February 2-21, 1995. u The Ugandan representatives included Mr, J. Mayanja-Nkangi, Minister of Finance and Economic Planning; Mr. C.N. Kikonyogo, Governor of the Bank of Uganda; Mr. E..Tumusiime-Mutebile, Secretary to the Treasury; and other senior officials. At the conclusion of the discussions, the .' mission also met with President Museveni, together with the Vice President, Mrs. Kazibwe, and the Prime Minister., Mr. Musoke. Uganda is 'on the standard 12,month Article IV consultation cycle. Uganda accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2. 3, and 4 in April 1994. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on November 22, 1993 (EBS/93/172). Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong and.comprehensive macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform efforts. Directors also noted that despite these substantial achievements, Uganda's economic situation remained fragile. They called for a broadening and deepening of structural reforms so as to diversify the economy and improve medium-term prospects. Following four successive annual arrangements under the ESAF between 1989,and 1994, on September 6, 1994, the Fund approved Uganda!s request for a new three-year ESAF arrangement, in an amount equivalent to SDR 120.51 million (90 percent of quota), and the first annual arrangement thereunder, in an amount equivalent to SDR 33.47 million (25 percent of quota). The first semiannual disbursement of SDR 16.74 million was made following Executive Board approval. In the attached letter and memorandum on economic and financial policies (MEFP) (Appendix I), the authorities, describe the progress to date ,in 1994/95, set out the objectives and policies to be pursued during the remainder of the fiscal year, and request the second disbursement under that arrangement. Details of Uganda's transactions with the'Fund through June 1997 are provided in Table 1, and a summary of Uganda's relations with the Fund appears in Appendix II. The World Bank Group continues to play an active role in Uganda's restructuring efforts, and disbursements under program loans from the Bank are projected to be about US$lOO million in 1994/95. Details of Uganda's relations with the World Bank Group are provided in Appendix III. A statistical inventory is presented in Appendix IV; basic economic, financial, and social data are given in Appendix V. t/ The staff team consisted of Mr. R. Sharer (head), Mr. H. De Zoysa, Mr. C. McDonald, Mr,. L. Errico (EP) (all AFR), Mr. T. Muzondo (FAD), and Mr. S. Schwartz (PDR). The team was assisted by Mr; M. Ellyne, the Fund's resident representative in Uganda.

Bat kat oudad 1994/55- As discussed in detail in EBS/94/1157 (8/15/94), performance under the 1993/94 program (July-June) was better than anticipated, and all the quantitative benchmarks were met (Table.2). 'Revised national accounts data h/ indicate that real GDP grew by 5.1 percent, and the share of investment in GDP continued its rising trend. However,- the end-June 1994 (year-on-year) inflation rate exceeded the program target of 9 percent, reaching 16 percent (Chart 1). External developments were characterized by sharply higher-than- anticipated exports, owing to higher 'volumes and a significant.improvement in the terms of trade, as well as buoyant unclassified private sector inflows. The net capital account also exceeded program projections. Consequently, the overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of US$lO6 million, instead of the expected deficit of US$lS million, and gross reserves rose to the equivalent of 2.9 months of imports (goods and nonfactor services) (Table 3). A major liberalization of the'exchange and trade system took place on November 1, 1993, when the new interbank foreign exchange market was introduced. *Subsequently, the exchange rate appreciated on account of the strong external performance; the real effective exchange rate appreciated by about 30 percent in 1993/94 (Chart 2); Fiscal performance was a'lso better.than expected, mainly due.to strict expenditure.control (Table 4). Total revenues were only 3 percent short of programmed levels, despite the negative effects of an appreciation of the exchange rate and lower petroleum prices. The deficit (commitment basis before grants) was 11.0 percent of GDP, slightly less'than the prograked deficit of 11.6 percent; Government repayments to the banking system were equivalent to 1.3 percent ,of GDP, compared with the programmed zero bank financing. Nevertheless, the growth of broad money (M2) exceeded the program target by a considerable margin (Table S), reflecting in particular the buildup of net foreign assets in the Bank of Uganda (BOU). Although the Government made considerable progress in its ambitious program of structural reforms, some benchmarks were not observed (Table 6). The civil service was reduced by 40,000 employees instead of the targeted 65,000, and the second phase of the army demobilization was somewhat below target, owing to a shortfall. of donor funds. Also, only two of the six targeted public enterprises were .divested, largely because of organizational problems. With respect to financial sector reforms, progress at the Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) was slower than expected, notably with respect to the creation of the Nonperforming Asset'.Recovery Trust (NPABT). However, the performance contract was finalfzed, a new management team sppofnted, and UCB's costs were reduced-through retrenchment and branch closures. a/ The national accounts series were revised in December 1994. Except for program references, data in the text are based on the revised series. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- . Table 2.

The Assembly's deliberations have taken longer than anticipated, and it is now expected to conclude its consideration of the new constitution by mid-1995. legislative and presidential elections are slated to be'held toward end-1995. The Government's medium-term macroeconomic .objectives, as set forth in the policy framework paper for 1994/95-1996/97, JJ are to: (i) sustain annual GDP growth of about 5.5 percent, or about 3 percent per capita; (ii) contain the year-on-year inflation rate at 7.5.percent in 1994/95, and 5 percent thereafter; (iii) strengthen substantially the balance of payments position; and (iv) accumulate gross international reserves equal to at; least five months of imports. In line with the authorities' medium-term goals, the basic macroeconomic objectives for 1994/95'were to: (i) achieva a real rate of GDP growth of 5.5 percent; (ii) contain inflation at.7.5 percent on an end-year basis; and (iii) reduce the external current account deficit to 6.6 percent of GDP while increasing gross reserves to 3.8 months of imports. To attain these objectives, the program emphasized a continued focus on .tight fiscal and monetary policies and on key structural measures. In particular, attention was to be focused on: (i) strengthening revenue mobilization and improving the efficiency of the tax system while providing for essential economic. and social expenditures; (ii) pursuing monetary ,. policies designed to sustain the gains made in controlling inflation while broadening and deepening financial sector reform; (iii) implementing an exchange rate policy designed to smooth pressures arising from volatility in external inflows; (iv) carrying forward the reform of the civil service and the demobilization of the army; and (v) accelerating the privatization and reforms of the parastatals. III. Reoor on the Discussi n md R t OS eview of the Program for I994/95 At the outset of the discussions, the authorities reiterated their firm commitment to prudent macroeconomic,policies and structural reforms to improving the incentive environment for private sector production and investment. They also stressed their commitment to enhanced domestic resource mobilization, particularly through the pursuit of prudent fiscal policies as the cornerstone of their adjustment effort. The authorities view this policy framework as providing a sound and sustainable basis for improving aggregate real income and achieving social progress, with an eventual reduction in their reliance- on external assistance. Available data indicate that economic and financial developments in the first half of 1994/95 exceeded the expectations e.nvisaged in the ESAP program in almost all areas.

All the program's quantitative and structural performance c,riteria and benchmarks for end-December 1994 were met (Tables 7 and 8). u Indications are that GDP growth could exceed the program target by a significant margin,.possibly reaching 6-8 percent. The improved growth performance is broadly based, reflecting higher output of cash crops, industrial production; construction, and private sector services. Much of this higher growth is attributed to an improved macro- economic environment in the recent pirst, continued political stability, and the successes of structural reforms. Moreover, this improved growth began before the full impact of the higher coffee prices was felt on the economy. There are also clear signs of rising levels of private sector savings and, investment. The higher growth has been accompanied by a lowering of inflation. At end-December 1994, the 12-month rate fell to 7 percent, due to a sharp fall in the food component reflecting an improved harvest. It also reflects the benefits of enhanced competition from the economic liberalization policies. The end-June 1995 rate IS projected to be about 7.5 percent, in line with the program. The GDP deflator, however, is now projected to,be about 12 percent, rather than the program projection of 9.5 percent, because of the sharply higher coffee prices. Thus, nominal GDP - should grow by about 20 percent in 1994/95, exceeding the programmed 15 percent increase. A major development during the first half of 1994/95 has been the surge in world coffee prices. Uganda's current projected average 1994/95 export price is USS2.57 per,kg, compared with the programmed USS1.50 per kg. Current price levels are in line with the levels of the mid-1980s, but according to.current World Economic Gutlook (WEO) projections, may fall again in the years ahead (Chart 3). In September 1994, 'a staff team visited Uganda to discuss with the iuthorities the likely impact of the coffee boom on macroeconomic aggregates,, particularly the exchange rate, prices, and domestic savings and investment, and the appropriate policy responses. The authorities adopted a policy approach involving an active and pragmatic stance in intervention in the foreign exchange market, and control of pressures on domestic money demand. They also adopted a framework for monitoring closely the macroeconomic impact of the boom, This policy stance has been effected through BOU intervention in'the interbank foreign exchange market and maintenance of a tight fiscal stance, including implemen';ation of . h/ The performance criteria for net domestic assets of the banking system and net claims on the Government by the banking system were adjusted for the amount by which import support and debt.relief exceeded U Sh 101.2 bilPion, in accordance with the program's internal contingency mechanism. , Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public.-lOa- .L Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - Tabla 7.

Fiscal oolicies The program aimed at reducing the overall fiscal deficit by about 3 percentage points, to 7.7 percent of GDP, and government repayments to the banking system of 0.9.percent of GDP (Table 4): Total revenues were expected to increase by about 1 percentage point, to 9.5 percent of GDP through discretionary measures and ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the tax system. The program adequately provided for essential recurrent expenditures, including significant increases in real wages. The development budget was to be.trimmed to improve the efficiency of public investment, given that it spread limited resources over a large number of projects. : During July-December-1994, the authorities maintained a tighter fiscal stance than programmed. Government repayments to the banking system were about U Sh 27 billion, or almost double the end-December 1994 performance criterion, because of tight control of monthly expenditure releases, and to a lesser extent because of overperformance on revenues. Revenue collection for the first half of 1994/9S was some U Sh 9 billion higher than programmed, mainly overperformance of excise duties and sales tax, because of buoyant economic activity, higher-than-programmed imports, and the on- going efforts to improve tax administration. This performance was achieved despite delays in implementing two revenue measures. First, because of strong resistance from interested groups, the coffee stabilization tax was put back two months, as noted above. Second, the withholding tax on interest income was not implemented because the enabling regulations were delayed. Nevertheless, the total amount budgeted for the year is expected to be collected because financial institutions have been withholding the tax since July 1, 1994. ' The authorities agreed with the staff that the program revenue target for 1994/9S could be exceeded, possibly by some U Sh lo-15 billion, or about 0.3 percent of GDP, based on a cautious estimate of developments during the first half of the year; The authorities stated that the overperformance of u The tax per kilogram, as. finally approved, was set at 32 percent of proceeds over U Sh 1,100 effective October 1, 1994, compared with.the original proposal of 20 percent when the price is between U Sh 1,100 and U Sh 2,200, and 40 percent when the price exceeds I! Sh 2,200, effective August 1, 1994. Because of .the delays, tax collection commenced only in January 1995, although exporters have been setting funds aside since the initial announcement in July 1994.

In fact, efforts will be made to hold government outlays below the program target, as noted below. In addition to the increase in revenues subject to the program revenue target, the coffee windfall tax is now estimated to be about U Sh 46 billion, compared with the programmed amount of U Sh 15 bil- lion, u and the excess, equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP, will be fully sterilized as provided for in the program's contingency mechanism. Thus, in response to the higher coffee inflows (estimated at about 4 percent of GDP), overall government fiscal performance is likely to lead to a significant increase in public sector savings. Moreover, private sector savings are expected to be about 1.8 percent of GDP above the program estimate, partly as a result of the increased coffee incomes, but also in response to the improved investment and growth trends in GDP, and declining inflationary expectations. The authorities stressed their commitment to increased savings in response to the coffee boom. However, they indicated a strong preference for retaining the original fiscal program target at this stage, in order to avoid additional pressure on expenditure that could arise from the perception of increased availability of resources. The mission expressed some concern that the increase in import-related taxes, particularly customs duties and sales tax collections, was not pro- portionate to the growth in imports. Available information did not permit a . detailed evaluation of the factors underlying the shortfall. However, technical discussions indicated several possible reasons, including an increase in exemptions granted under the Investment Code (which is currently under review), and under Statutory Instruments (which includes discretionary exemptions). Additionally, there appears to have been a shift in the recorded composition of imports toward those countries enjoying preferential tariff rates, and an increase in warehouse stocks, taxes on which are payable at a later stage. The authorities concurred with the staff's concern about possible erosion of the tax base. They had already initiated a study of the issue and disciplined officials who had improperly granted exemptions. They requested technical assistance to undertake a compre- hensive examination of current exemptions policies and practices with a view to improving management and performance in this area. As regards the review of the Investment Code, there is likely to be some delay from the envisaged timetable because the consultant's study .for the purpose was clearly in- adequate. However, the authorities are reviewing the issue, in close collaboration with the Fund and World Bank staffs, with a view to agreeing on appropriate tax policy changes as rapidly as possible. The staff expressed concern that underexpenditures during the first half of the year had been deferrals rather than savings, that wages appeared to be running somewhat above the programmed amounts, that additional spending was required on certain nonwage items, such as the extension of the CA to complete drafting the new constitution, and that there were pressures a/ me estimated coffee tax receipts on the basis of the pre-boom coffee prices included in the original program projections.

The authorities indicated that regarding wages, the overruns (4 percent of the annual wage bill). represented arrears and overpayment of professional allowances. They pointed out that overpayments would be recovered during the second half of the year. Moreover, savings on domestic and external interest payments, on externally funded development expenditures, and on some lower-priority nonwage recurrent items, were expected to more than offset the other modest overruns. Accordingly, the authorities stated that they expected total budgetary outlays in 1994/9S to be below the targets included in the, program. However, as with the revenue projections, they preferred the cautious approach of retaining the original program projections at this stage. Furthermore, they pointed out that none of the Cross-Border Initiative (CBI) measures that are to be implemented in 1994/9S (such as harmonized transit charges and the bond guarantee scheme) will have negative effects on revenues. In the area of military expenditures, the staff noted the savings achieved through the demobilization exercise. Thus, although military wages had been increased substantially from the very low base, the proportion of military expenditures to recurrent expenditures had fallen consistently since 1989/90. The staff also noted that if nonwage military outlays could continue to be constrained and the next phase of the demobilization program effectively implemented, it should be possible to channel part of the "peace dividend" toward key social needs. As regards tax administration, the authorities have made considerable progress in preparing for the introduction of a value-added tax (‘VA-?), and observed the performance criterion to draft the appropriate legislation and regulations before December 31, 1994. The draft legislation is currently being debated by an appropriate committee of the legislature. The Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) has continued efforts to assign tax identification numbers (TINS). By end-December 1994, the URA had assigned some 75 percent of business TINS and 20 percent of individual TINS, completing the second stage of the program in accordance with the structural benchmark. Monetary policies for 1994/9S were designed to sustain the gains made since 1992/93 in reducing inflation. Thus,a prudent broad money growth of 1S percent was programmed, in line with nominal GDP (Table 5). In this context, the contingency mechanisms included in the program with regard to import support, debt relief, and the stabilization tax on coffee were designed to help sterilize additional inflows beyond programmed amounts. At end-December 1994, the 12-month rate of.broad money expansion amounted to 37 percent, compared with 25 percent in the program projection, reflecting the sharply higher-than-programmed buildup in gross resumes of the BOU. Additionally, growth in private sector credit was strong in the first six months of 1994/9S, on account of the buoyant level of economic activity, but this was more than offset by the overperformance of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-16- ‘. Government. As a result, in the first half of 1994/9S net domestic assets of the banking system rose by U Sh 4.7 billion; well within the program performance criterion of U Sh 13.4 billion. Taking account of expected fiscal and external developments, broad money growth could be around 30 percent for the year to end-June 19%. This monetary growth should be consistent with the price objective of the program in view of the expected higher real GDP growth, and indications to date, which suggest that velocity has declined relative to program levels. This , decline reflects the increased monetization of the economy, as evidenced by the fall in the share of nonmonetary GDP in the revised national accounts, the willingness of the private sector to hold higher cash balances in view of the coffee boom, and lower inflationary expectations. The staff never- theless urged the authorities to pursue cautious monetary policies and be ready to take additional action at an early stage as needed to stem any emerging inflationary pressures. The authorities- stated that they would continue to,monitor developments closely in the context of the policy framework introduced in response to the increased external inflows and the need to protect external competitiveness. They indicated a readiness to undertake additional sterilization measures in the event that external developments lead to higher liquidity, including the increased use of government paper, and consideration of possible short-term revenue measures. The,staff concurred with the authorities on the need to continue this mixed policy response, which involves a cautious and pragmatic stance in the foreign exchange market to contain any undue appreciation of the exchange rate while simultaneously preventing excessive monetary growth. Interest yields on 91-day treasury bills, which account for 75 percent of the market, declined to about 7 percent at end-December 1994, while longer-dated bills yielded 12-15 percent. In order to deepen the market, in December the authorities introduced 364-day bills as previously recommended by the Pund staff. .Toward end-1994 commercial bank bidding for treasury bills declined, even though banks continued to hold large amounts,of unremunerated excess reserves. The staff suggested that this could be explained by: (I) the large differential between the BOU rediscount rate and the reduced treasury bill yields; (ii) the fact that many banks were forced to maintain high levels of liquidity because of a poorly functioning0 interbank shilling market and stricter.enforcement of BOU rules on credit accommodation; and (iii) anticipation of continued high credit demand. The authorities concurred on the need to review the rediscount rate, currently 8 percentage points over the 91-day treasury-bill rate, compared with 3 percentage points one year ago. In addition, the'authorities recognize that the treasury bill market remains relatively small and shallow and will continue efforts to develop a. secondary market. To this end, they are studying the possibility of implementing a system of primary dealers and enforcing existing legislation requiring insurance corporations to invest at least 25 percent of their assets in govetient securities. With respect to the poorly functioning interbank shilling market, the authorities concurred with the staff that this is likely to persist until the performance of problem banks improves. The BOU is also considering the possibility of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public.; ', 17 - issuing'new financial instruments. The mission'cautioned that in the context of a fledgling treasury bill market, this could send conflicting signals to market participants and reduce the effectiveness of monetary operations. The mission suggested that the authorities should not rule out a more active use of reserve requirements, preferably remunerated, if conditions warrant, A forthcoming MAE mission will advise on these issues. While savings and time deposit rates have fallen to 3-7 percent, lending rates remain relatively high, at around 16-22 percent. The large spread in interest rates reflectsthe continued profitability problems of the banking sector arising from the huge stock of nonperforming loans, which at end-December 1994 was estimated to represent about SO percent of all outstanding credit to the private sector. In the area of financial sector reforms, the BOU Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in November in.accordance with the structural benchmark. Five hundred staff have already been voluntarily retrenched and other cost-cutting measures are under way. However, despite progress toward restructuring the UCB, delays continue in the implementation of the reform efforts in the context of the World Bank Financial Sector Adjustment Credit. Although the NPART has been established and its trustees appointed, the transfer of the UCB's nonperforming loans awaits a decision on the bank's recapitalisation. In addition, progress toward privatization has been delayed because of lack of definition of the expected modalities of privatization and the, resulting difficulty in securing the services of a merchant bank to prepare an action plan. Given the dominance of the UCB in the banking system, the completion of its restructuring is critical to current financial sector reforms, and the staff urged the authorities to proceed expeditiously with its recapitalization and privatization. The authorities stressed their commitment to the privatization of the UCB as soon as the technical issues are resolved and a detailed plan is formulated. While the UCB remains the critical element affecting the banking system, at least five other banks have been classified as weak and are being closely monitored by the BOU to ensure'that steps are taken to achieve capital adequacy and profitability. In these circumstances, the authorities have created a Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which would cover accounts up to a maximum of U Sh 3 million. Commercial banks have already paid one year's premium, and the mission urged the Government to make the fund operational by effecting its contribution of U Sh 2 billion, possibly in the form of treasury bills. The activation of the DIF, however, 'underscores the need for an urgent strengthening of the weak banks and a significant enhancement in supervision. ,. 3. * The stronger-than-expected performance of the balance of payments continued in 1994/9S, in.part because of the sharp improvement in the terPas of trade, estimated at 80 percent; in the first half of the year, coffee export prices averaged US$2.43/kg and are expected to be USS2.57 for the year as a whole. Coffee exports are now projected to be US$417 million, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-.18 - some 90 percent higher than the program projection. Noncoffee exports are also buoyant and are now projected to grow by US$26 million above program levels The rising trend of private transfers accelerated during the first half of 1994/9S, such that they are now projected to be US$31S million; US$32 million above program levels. At the same time, imports are running some US$200 million ahead of the program target and are expected to be 35 percent over 1993/94 levels. The current account deficit (excluding grants) for 1994/9S is projected to decline to S percent of GDP (6.6 percent in the program) (Table 9). Despite the real exchange rate appreciation that occurred in 1993/94, the growth.of noncoffee exports so far in 1994/9S has been robust. Never- 'theless, a recent study concluded that the current.level of the exchange rate threatens the profitability of some exports, including cotton, tea, and tobacco. However, once other factors are taken into account--such as gains in productivity, reductions in import costs, and declines in interest rates-- the current exchange rate appears broadly appropriate. While producer prices for some smallholder crops will be lowered, the authorities expressed confidence that these favorable supply side developments would offset any losses in competitiveness from the appreciation. On this basis, the outlook for most noncoffee exports remains favorable, although the authorities are concerned about the impact of any further significant appreciation. The capital account surplus for 1994/9S is now projected to be.somewhat smaller (US$32 million) than assumed under the program, largely because of an increase in projected dollar holdings of the private sector. .Never- theless, the overall balance of payments is still projected to record a surplus of US$132 million, some US$43 million higher than the program level. Gross reserves'rose by US$99 million during the first half of 1994/9S, -more than the program target for the year'as a whole. Gn present projections, gross reserves could rise by US$174 million in 1994/9S, to the equivalent of 4.1 months of imports. In view of the higher level of imports and overall fragility of the economy and the, external sector, the authorities will increase gross reserves by a minimum of US$14S million, consistent with the program target of 3.8 months of imports;' The authorities' efforts to eliminate external arrears (Table 10) by the end of the program year were enhanced on February 20, 199S, when Uganda became the first country to receive a stock of debt operation from Paris Club creditors under the new Naples terms. Under this operation, which is viewed as an exit rescheduling, Uganda's eligible pre-cutoff-date debt will be reduced by, 67 percent in net present value terms (see Annex for details). Thus, Uganda's outstanding debt to the Paris Club in.net present value terms would be reduced by US$66 million, with debt service relief in 1994/9S of about US$l2 million. The authorities have indicated that they would seek rescheduling agreements on comparable terms with non-Paris Club bilateral and private creditors.' Such agreements, after cash payments of US$18 mil- lion, would eliminate external arrears by the end of the progrsm yesr, and could provide an additional US$26 million in debt service relief.

J,/ Thus, the original program projection-- that Uganda's recourse to exceptional financing could be eliminated by the end of the three-year program period--remains on track. The interbank foreign exchange market has functioned smoothly so far in 1994/95. After a period of turbulence in August 1994, possibly related to the coffee harvest, the exchange rate has been.stable at around U Sh 925/US$l. This reflects the BOU's active intervention in the market, as well as the demand for dollars to satisfy higher import requirements. The Ugandan authorities are committed to maintaining a liberal trade regime. They are in the process of finalizing the draft letter of CBI policy, which would further enhance trade with Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) countries. The import ban on cigarettes has been removed, and the authorities have indicated their willingness to consider removing the remaining bans on beer and soft drinks as quickly as possible. 4. Bd - e ium term nrosnects and canacitv to renav the Pund The medium-term balance of payments projections depend on the evolution of coffee prices, and the associated import response. The baseline scenario, using current WE0 price forecasts, shows the coffee boom peaking in 1995/96, and trailing off gradually to 1998/99, after which prices would stabilize at USS1.74 (Table 9)., Given recent and expected investments, noncoffee exports are projected to grow steadily, albeit from a low base. The import boom that began in the first half of 1994/95 is expected to continue in 1995/96, with nonproject import demand rising in line with GDP. Thereafter, the growth of imports is expected to moderate. Private transfers are assumed to increase by about 3 percent a year. Given these developments, the current account deficit is expected to stay within sustainable levels, growing to 6.0 percent of GDP in 1997/98, and dropping to 5.7 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period. ;h/ This level of the current account deficit should be manageable, given the projected decline in Uganda's debt to GDP ratio over the medium term, and the prospects that, in addition to concessional inflows from multilaterals, long-term private capital inflows would begin to contribute to the financing of the deficit. JJ Of the total financing gap to be covered by rescheduling agreements, US$203 million consists of arrears to non-Paris Club bilateral creditors, and US$38 million (of which US$12 million is to Paris Club creditors) consists of current debt service obligations. a/ The current account deficits during the last two years of the projection period are about one-half of a percentage point higher than projected in the last staff report (EBS/94/157). This reflects an upward shift of the underlying import function as a result of ongoing structural changes in the economy, rather than factors directly related to the temporary coffee boom.

Additionally, private capital inflows should grow on the strength of confidence in the sustainability of Uganda's adjustment efforts. ,Gross international reserves would accumulate sharply in 1995/96 and 1996/97, when coffee prices are high and amortization payments relatively low, reaching 6.5 months of imports. This buildup in reserves would facilitate the payment of substantial obligations due to multilateral and other creditors in the outer years of the projection period, By the end of the period, reserves would amount to 5.5 months of imports, a level deemed prudent in light of Uganda's vul- 'nerability to external shocks. Under this scenario, modest financing gaps would persist throughout the projection period. About one third of these gaps would be closed by the debt relief just agreed to by the Paris Club, with the remainder met by non-Paris Club bilateral creditors in rescheduling agreements on comparable terms, 1 The sensitivity of the balance of'payments to some key assumptions is presented in Table 11. If coffee prices were to return to their projected medium-term levels (USS1.74 per kg) in 1995/96 and remain there, the financing gap would widen by about US$6 million in 2001/02, and the debt service ratio would be about 1 percentage point higher. 'Slower growth in noncoffee exports would result in a higher current account deficit of 6.3 percent of GDP in 2001/02, a US$63 million larger'financing gap, and an increase in the debt service ratio of almost 3 percentage points, to 31.2 percent. Finally, if private transfers were to remain constant at their 1994/95 levels,. the current account deficit by 2001/02 would increase to 6.5 percent of GDP, the financing gap would be US$l14 million, and the debt service ratio would increase by a little less than 1 percentage point (Table 12). . The share of multilaterals (including the Fund) in Uganda's outstanding debt stock is high, and stood at 72 percent at the end of December 1994 (Table 12). Because of the concessional nature of this debt, however, the. share of multilaterals in Uganda's scheduled debt service is somewhat lower, at 57 percent in 1994/95. Over the medium term, this share rises to about 60 percent in 1996/97, and then declines to about 52 percent by the end of the projection period (Table 13). After accounting for the Paris Club stock of debt operation and assuming that rescheduling agreements are reached with non-Paris Club bilateral and private creditors .on comparable terms, these ratios, expressed as a share of the reduced total debt service, would amount to 75 percent in 1994/95, 79 percent in 1996/97, and 60 percent by the end of the projection period.

In relation to exports of goods and nonfactor services, debt service payments to the Fund would rise from 4.4 percent in 1994/95 .to 10.2 percent in 1997/98,'and decline to 5.9 percent by 2001/02., Since the period 1985-88, when Uganda experLenced difficulties meeting its financial obligations to the F'und arising from successive stand-by arrangements approved during 1981-84, Uganda has effected all payments to the Fund on a timely basis.. In view of the recent significant increase in gross international reserves, bolstered by favorable external developments, the improved outlook, and the authorities' continued commitment to imple- menting a strong adjustment program, Uganda should not have difficulty meeting its obligations to the Fund on time. Uganda places the highest priority on effecting payments to the Fund. 5. Other structural issues. Jecmcal assistance. md social nol,&& With a view to improving the efficiency and speed of the prfvatization process, the Government, with the assistance of the World Bank Group, has made several far-reaching changes. Enterprises will be classified into two groups --a select.group of utilities and public service entities in which the Government will keep a presence, and the remainder which will be privatized.. Also, the privatization process is to be completed more rapidly.than previously envisaged. The organization structure has been revised to overcome the operational and jurisdictional problems that have slowed progress. As a result of these changes, the privatization process. has quickened in recent months. Eight enterprises were divested in the period July-December 1994, thereby satisfying the structural benchmarks for end-, December 1994 and end-June 1995, and several more are in the final stages. The staff congratulated the authorities on the progress in this. key area. They noted that privatization proceeds, hitherto minimal, could become significant, and that consideration should be given to integrating these proceeds with the budget. The authorities noted that the first claim on proceeds was clearance of outstanding enterprise debts, and that net proceeds might not be large. They agreed.that this should be reviewed in the context of formulating the 1995/96 program. The Government attaches high priority to continued progress in the restructuring of the civil service and demobilization of the army. By end- December 1994, civil service staffing levels were below 150,000 (a structural performance criterion) and the first stage of staff rationali- zation for four ministries was completed. The second phase of the army demobilization program was completed by end-July 1994, and indications are that a further 12,500 soldiers will be.demobilized in the third phase, which is expected to commence shortly. This would represent a reduction in force of some 45,000, or 50 percent of the size of the army since 1992. The third phase, which will include expanded health and education components, will cost an estimated US$18 million.

Priority in the next few years will focus on FAD technical assistance on the legislative and institutional aspects associated with the introduction of the VAT, as well as improving the administrative efficiency of the tax system, including improving management and control of exemptions (Appendix II). Additional technical assistance may also be required in the context of the CBI to assist in the coordination of customs administration with Kenya, and in harmonizing with neighboring countries tax incentives given under the Investment Code. In the monetary area, the authorities will need further technical assistance from E4AE to strengthen monetary - management. Finally, there is need for a follow-up mission on balance of payments statistical issues, particularly unclassified private transfers. Since the commencement of the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in 1987, the economic well-being of Uganda's rural population has improved substan- tially, particularly through higher producer prices following reforms in the exchange rate, trade, tax, and marketing systems. More recently, coffee smallholder producers have more than doubled their income, thanks to the liberalization of marketing and the surge in coffee prices. Smallholder farmers will also benefit from the World Bank-supported revitalization of the cotton sector. One of the central benefits of the ERP has been the decline in inflation, with attendant benefits for the poor. In addition, budgetary allocations for basic social services such as primary health care, education, water supply, and rural infrastructure have been increased in real terms. Efforts are also being made to minimize the adverse effects of retrenchment programs. Each demobilized soldier and his/her dependents are provided with transport to their homes, a cash subsistence allowance, materials for constructing basic shelter and for farming, an enhanced health p=kqe, a1.J an education training program. For the civil service, coun- seling and vocational training is provided in addition to the severance package. 6. The program's original quantitative and structural benchmarks through end-June 1995 will be maintained to permit the staff and the authorities to monitor progress in policy implementation (Tables 7 and 8). The program also continues to incorporate contingency mechanisms with regard to addi- tional donor financing and debt relief, and with regard to the impact of any coffee prices over and above the programmed level. In this context, addi- tional inflows will be sterilized by offsetting reductions in net domestic assets and net credit to the Government. IV. Staff m Uganda has made impressive progress in restructuring its economy since the inception of the adjustment effort in 1987. Controls have been removed, incentives enhanced, the exchange and trade system liberalized, and the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public‘. ‘-28- I. performance of the fiscal, external, and monetary sectors substantially improved. Thus macroeconomic stability has largely been achieved, and major progress made,. in creating a liberal market-oriented environment to encourage private sector production and investment. The pace of these reforms has gained momentum thus far in 1994/95. Economic growth, already high, is expected to adcelerate further'. To some' .extent, this reflects the favorable impact of the surge in coffee earnings, but more importantly it is due to the confidence generated by political stability and the impact of.the disciplined economic and financial policies that the Government has pursued for some time. Thus, prospects are favorable that strong'economic growth can be sustained in the years ahead. Furthermore, the staff welcomes the major progress made in structural reform, particularly in regard to privatization and the downsizing of the civil service and the army. After several years,of facing an unfavorable'external environment, Uganda began early in 1994/95 to benefit from a sharp surge in the price of coffee, its dominant export. The authorities have rightly treated these inflows as temporary. The staff commends the authorities' policy response, which has so far been successful in avoiding an undue appreciation of the real exchange rate, thereby protecting the competitiveness of the noncoffee economy.' This has been achieved through the maintenance of tight fiscal policies, including,implementation of the coffee stabilization tax, as well as an active stance in the foreign exchange and treasury bill markets. The stability of the exchange rate over the last six months has facilitated a strong performance of noncoffee external inflows. The continued sharp growth of nontraditional exports, albeit from a low base, is particularly encouraging, demonstrating private sector confidence and progress in the much needed area of export diversification. Against this background of buoyant external inflows and strong economic growth, maintaining a tight fiscal stance in the months ahead will be essential. The staff therefore welcomes the continued strict control of monthly releases by the Treasury. On the revenue side, performance has been good, but the need to increase the relatively low tax/GDP ratio remains critical, particularly through broadening the tax net and improving efficiency. In this context, the staff welcomes the progress made toward introducing a value added tax. On the other hand, the possible erosion of the tax base through exemptions is worrisome and will.have to be carefully examined and corrected. The staff commends the-authorities for having quickly commissioned a study of current exemption policies,and practices in order to improve management and performance in this area. It will be important to set clear criteria and guidelines for granting exemptions, with a view to reducing them to a minimum, This is an area where technical asiistance+would usefully complement the authorities' efforts. Uganda's performance. could be further enhanced by improved efficiency of the financial system. The staff commends the authorities for the considerable progress made in reducing the cost structure of the UCB and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - upgrading its management, and in improving the supervision of other commercisl banks. However, progress under the financial sector reform program will need to be accelerated if the banking system is to more effectively meet the need to mobilize and channel domestic resources to productive purposes. The staff urges the authorities to proceed with the recapitalization of UCB and to agree on the modalities for its privatisation once qualified buyers are identified. The staff believes that private ownership is essential if the financial sector reform program is to succeed. The staff also commends the authorities for the progress in restructuring the BOU. Further financial strengthening through the completion of the BOU's recapitalization is required for the bank to be fully effective as the apex of the financial system in the current deregulated environment. The goal of developing the treasury bill and capital markets has to come through : the creation of stable and profitable banks supported by comprehensive and well-enforced financial laws and regulations. In February 1995, Uganda became the first country to receive a stock of debt operation on Naples terms from Paris Club creditors. The authorities have indicated that they will seek rescheduling agreements, on comparable terms, with non-Paris Club bilateral and private creditors. Together, these reschedulings would eliminate Uganda's immediate financing gaps. The share of multilaterals in Uganda's foreign financing needs and debt stock will remain high, but because of their highly concessional nature, the share of multilaterals in debt service will continue to be lower. Medium-term prospects indicate that it can be accommodated, provided that the new inflows are on appropriately concessional terms, and Uganda continues to implement strong adjustment policies aimed at achieving the projected strengthening of its export performance, overall debt-servicing capacity, and gross international reserve position. Thus, the original program projection-- that Uganda's recourse to exceptional financing could be eliminated by the end of the three-year program period--remains on track. The Paris Club agreement is intended to be an exit rescheduling, which, together with the high level of multilateral debt, underscores the critical need to maintain prudent macroeconomic policies in the years ahead to prevent the emergence of additional financing gaps. Notwithstanding the progress achieved so far under the program, a number of risks remain in the period ahead. The assumption of a continued decline in velocity calls for caution concerning the rapid growth of money. It will be essential for the authorities to monitor monetary developments closely and be prepared to restrain money expansion, if inflationary pressures emerge. There is also the possibility that pressures on the budget could emerge, particularly as elections are scheduled for the end of 1995. Accordingly, it is essential that revenue and expenditure targets be strictly observed, including continued implementation of the coffee windfall tax. To reduce these risks, which are heightened by Uganda's continued vulnerability to external shocks, the authorities will need to maintain their disciplined financial policies.

In the first half of 1994/95, they implemented the program's macroeconomic and structural policies in a timely manner, and have made substantial progress, exceeding the program targets thus far in almost all areas. Nevertheless, Uganda remains a poor country, its recent recovery starts from a low level, and the economy remains fragile and vulnerable to external shocks.. Therefore, the author- ities will need to continue to implement the program with the same vfgor and determination that they have shown over the last year. The success of Uganda's adjustment effort continues to be vitally dependent on the support of the donor community. The staff believes that the authorities' strong performance thus far in 1994/95 clearly merits such support in general, and, of the Fund by way of Executive Board completion of this present review, to enable the availability.of the second disbursement under the first annual arrangement of the ESAF.

Since mid-1987, the Government of Uganda has been implementing an ongoing adjustment program designed to promote economic growth and stability. These strong adjustment efforts are being continued in the context of the Government's 1994/95 program as described in the memorandum attached to the letter to the Managing Director of the Fund dated July 25, 1994. The 1994/95 program is.intended to broaden and deepen structural reforms, and to improve medium-term prospects. 2. The basic macroeconomic objectives of the 1994/95 program were: (I) to achieve a growth of 5.5 percent in real GDP; (ii) to contain inflation to 7.5 percent on an end-year basis; and,(iii) to reduce the external current account deficit to 6.6 percent of GDP, while increasing gross resewes to. 3.8 months of goods .and nonfactor services, and normalizing Uganda's external payments situation. 3. Available data indicate that economic and financial developments for the' first half of 1994/95 exceeded expectations. There are indications that GDP growth in 1994/95 could.reach 6-8 percent,on account 'of the favorable performance of cash crops, industrial production, construction, and private sector services: There are also clear,signs of a rising level of private sector investment, Inflation has.declined from an annual rate of 16 percent at end-June 1994 to 7 percent at end-December, mainly due to declines in food prices, and is expected to remain within the program target for end- June 1995. The GDP deflator, however, is now projected to be about 12 percent, compared with the program projection of 9.5 percent, because of the sharply higher coffee prices. Thus, nominal GDP should increase by about 20 percent in 1994/95, compared with the programmed 15 percent increase. 4. A major development during the first half'of 1994/95 has been the unexpected surge in coffee prices. Although prices have been volatile, reaching a peak of about US$3.5O/kg in September 1994 before declining to about USS2.50 in December, the average price for 1994/95 will be substan- ' . ,tially above the program projection of US$l.SO/kg. As a result, the value of coffee exports is likely to be almost double the program target. In September 1994, the likely impact of the boom in coffee prices on macro- economic aggregates was discussed with a Fund staff team, and the Government 'agreed on the modalities of a monitoring mechanism and a policy framework for a broad intervention strategy in light of the changed economic and financial conditions. The Government's concerns were the need to maintain an exchange rate that protects the external competitiveness of the emerging and vibrant noncoffee export sector and potential new investments, while at the same time exercising caution about the domestic monetary impact on inflation of the intervention strategy. The overalI strategy has involved a more active stance in the foreign exchange interbank market and domestic monetary policy combined with strong efforts to tighten the fiscal stance on domestic demand, including introduction of the coffee stabilization tax. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - m The strategy has been successful during the first half of 1994/95 in preventing further exchange rate appreciation while also containing inflation. Following some volatility in the exchange rate during August 1994, the exchange rate has stabilized at around U Sh 925 per U.S. dollar since September, compared with U Sh 963 per U.S. dollar at end-June 1994. The Government will continue to pursue a pragmatic mix of policy elements, including a tight fiscal stance through continued implementation of the coffee tax and other fiscal actions, further exchange market intervention as appropriate, and domestic sterilization of excess liquidity in the financial system. 5. In addition to the impact of higher coffee exports on the external sector, noncoffee exports have continued to grow rapidly, albeit from a small base. Private transfers also appear to be exceeding expectations, and. are projected to be about US$30 million above program levels for the year as a whole. At the same time, imports are running significantly higher than the programmed level, on account of the rise in incomes stemming from higher coffee prices, higher investment inflows, generally buoyant economic activity and enhanced growth prospects, as well as the appreciation of the exchange rate and possibly humanitarian aid inflows to the region. The current account deficit should be about 5 percent of GDP, significantly less than the program target, and the overall balance of payments could show a surplus of about US$131 million, compared with the program amount of US$89 million. 6. During the first half of 1994/95, gross international reserves rose by US$99 million compared with the target increase of at least US$38 million. This reflects the Bank of Uganda's (BGU) intervention in the interbank foreign exchange market to stabilize the exchange rate. Thus, the per- formance criterion for end-December 1994 on the minimum increase in gross international reserves was observed. Moreover, the benchmark for reserves at end-June 1995 of an increase of US$94 million is likely to be signif- icantly exceeded. In view of the higher level of imports and the overall fragility of the economy and the external sector, the Government will aim to increase gross resemes by at least US$145 million during 1994/95, con- sistent with the program target of 3.8 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services. The performance criteria on new nonconcessional external borrowing, short-term external credits of the BGU, and the change in the stock of external payments arrears were also observed. 7. At their February meeting, Paris Club creditors agreed on the modalities of a stock of,debt operation for Uganda, involving a reduction in net present value terms of two thirds of the eligible pre-cutoff-date debt outstanding. Thus, Uganda became the first country to be accorded such a debt stock reduction. The Government will continue to pursue rescheduling agreements with other non-Paris Club creditors on comparable terms. The original program projection that Uganda's recourse to exceptional financing could be eliminated by the end of the three-year arrangement period therefore remains on track.

The fiscal stance during the first half of the year was tighter than programmed, with the deficit before. grants some U Sh 30 billion lower than expected. Total revenue collection for the first half of 1994/95 was U'Sh 9 billion above target, and revised,projections indicate that the annual target of U Sh 472 billion should be exceeded. This performance reflects buoyant economic activity and the higher level of imports, as well as the ongoing efforts to improve tax administration. With regard to imports, there has not been a proportionate increase in duty collections, which may reflect a shift in the composition of imports towards exempted or lower-rated items, possibly weak customs administration at the border, or a modest increase in discretionary and/or diplomatic exemptions. The Government has already initiated a study of this problem, and will take appropriate action to ensure that exemptions have a proper legal and economic basis. The Government has implemented all of the revenue measures contained in the program,'except the transfer to the URA of the responsi- bility for collecting parastatal dividends. This is no longer appropriate in view of the revised arrangements for parastatal cost control and privatization, described in paragraph 14 below. These measures will be introduced as soon as possible. There was also some delay in the imple- mentation of the coffee stabilization tax as originally proposed. Following intense public discussior?s and debate with interested parties, the tax was modified with respect to the original program. It was finally sst at 32 percent of the export proceeds exceeding U Sh 1,100 per kg, compared to the original budget proposal of 20 percent of the receipts between U Sh 1,100 per kg and U Sh 2,200 per kg, and 40 percent of receipts exceeding U Sh 2,200 per kg. The tax also became effective October 1, 1994, instead of August 1, 1994. Coffee tax receipts are projected to total about U Sh 46 billion. The amount exceeding U Sh 15 billion will be sterilized as provided for in the program. 9. In the area of tax administration, substantial progress has been made in preparation for introducing a value added tax (VAT) on July 1, 1996, with continued strong technical support and advice from the Fund. The Government has met the performance criterion to draft the appropriate legislation and regulations before December 31, 1994. The Government has also continued to pursue vigorously the other areas of improved tax administration and has met the end-December benchmark to complete the second stage of the assignment of taxpayer identification numbers. 10. Concerning expenditures, outlays were held to below the Government's budget target for the first half of the fiscal year, largely through continued tight control of monthly expenditure releases by the Treasury. This overall cautious fiscal stance was a key factor behind the Government's success in limiting pressures on the exchange rate and prices consequent to the coffee boom. Thus, the Government's net credit position with the banking system at end-December 1994 showed an improvement of U Sh 27 bil- lion, compared with the performance criterion of an improvement of U Sh 14.7 billion. All indications are that the end-June benchmark will also be respected, even using conservative budget projections for the rest of the year. Nevertheless, given the current pressure on monetary aggregates arising from the coffee boom and the limited monetary Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-36- sterilization tools available, the Government will explore possible contingency revenue measures and ongoing expenditure constraint to reinforce the,prudent monetary policy.as appropriate. 11. Concerning monetary policies and financial'sector developments, the growth in monetary aggregates exceeded the program expectations for the first half of 1994195. At end-December 1994, the 12-month rate of broad money expansion amounted to 37 percent, compared with 25 percent in the program projection. This was influenced by the buildup in gross inter- national reserves of the BOU as noted above, and also by stronger-than- anticipated growth in credit to the private sector on account of the buoyant level of economic activity and the increased level of international trade. This private sector credit growth was offset by the. overperformance by the Government, and the increase in net domestic assets of the banking system was within the program performance criterion. Private sector credit demand is expected to remainstrong in the second half of the year. Taking account of expected fiscal and external developments, aggregate monetary growth could reach 30 percent at end-June 1995, which is well above the original program target. This should be consistent with the price objective in view of the higher GDP growth and continued decline in velocity on account of increased monetization of the economy and growing confidence in Uganda's economic performance and prospects. Containing inflation remains a primary goal of the Government. 12. The main instrument for monetary sterilization available to complement the BOU's intervention in the foreign exchange market is treasury bills. However, this market remains relatively small and lacking in depth. The Government has therefore continued efforts to encourage development of a secondary market, and to further broaden and deepen the market, including the issuance of longer-dated bills; a one-year maturity bill was recently introduced. Nevertheless, transactions with commercial banks for bills of 91-day maturity continue to dominate the market.. To more effectively implement monetary policy, the BOU has been studying ways to encourage the treasury bill market through diversification of the asset holdings of nonbank financial institutions, as well as considering the possibility of issuing new financial instruments and perhaps a more active use of reserve requirements, possibly partly remunerated. 13. In the area of financial sector reforms, the BOU's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan, thus meeting the benchmark for end-December 1994. Implementation of the plan is already under way, and some 500 staff have been retrenched under a voluntary retirement scheme. Further actions . under the plan will be taken to improve the ,BOU's financial performance, including additional involuntary retrenchment and sale of assets. The restructuring will include issuance of a.Government bond to recapitalize the BOU. Progress has also be.en made in the restructuring of the Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB). The bank has been downsized by retrenching one third of its staff and one fifth of its branches, and a n&w management team has been appointed. To further the reform of the UCB, and in particular, restore its balance sheet to solvency, the Nonperforming Assets Recovery Trust (NPART) has been established, the trustees appointed, and a management Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - team scheduled to be in place shortly. The Government remains committed to the early privatization of the UCB in the context of the Financial Sector Rehabilitation Program being implemented with the support of the World Bank. However, a detailed plan of action to effect the privatization could be delayed because specific proposals for Government's consideration have not yet been formulated by consultants. Another financial sector concern is the weak performance of some banks. There is evidence that the banking system is becoming increasingly competitive. Licensing of several new banks is in process, which will likely lead to further pressure on the weak banks. In these circumstances, it is essential that the recently devised Deposit Insurance Fund be instituted as rapidly as possible. To this end, the Government will effect its contribution of U Sh 2 billion in the near future, possibly through issuance of special treasury bills, The author- ities are also reviewing ways to enhance rural savings, including possible revival of the system of savings through the Post Office network. 14. Considerable progress was made in implementing the other structural elements of the program. Progress in privatizinq state-owned enterprises had been retarded by a cumbersome administrative structure, which slowed decision making and implementation. With the full commitment of the highest levels of the Government, the program's goals have now been revised to limit the Government's eventual involvement in enterprises to a few key public services and responsibilities. Moreover, the Government is committed to complete the process as rapidly as possible , and much earlier than origi- nally planned, and also to improve financial control. To this end, the Public Enterprises Reform and Divestiture Secretariat has been disctolved and replaced by a Parastatal Monitoring Unit and a Privatization Unit under the direct responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. The new policy stance with respect to privatization has already achieved impressive results, and the benchmarks of privatizing four enterprises by end-December 1994, and a further four by end-June 1995, have both already been exceeded. Receipts from the sale of enterprises, which have been negligible in the past, are expected to increase significantly. The Government is reviewing the treatment of these receipts to ensure that they are channeled to productive purposes, consistent with government policies. 15. The civil service reform program is also on track, and the end-December 1994 performance criterion to reduce the number of civil service positions to 150,000 was observed, as was the benchmark on implementing the first stage of staff rationalization plans for four ministries. The army demobilization is proceeding on schedule with the final phase involving about 13,000 soldiers already initiated and expected to be completed by the end of the year. The remaining benchmark concerns agreeing with the Fund staff by end-March 1995 on tax policy changes consequent to the study of the Investment Code. In this area, the consultant's study did not adequately address the underlying issues involved, and consequently, an elaboration of the issues and specific proposals on tax policy changes may not be presented to the Government in accordance with the originally agreed time table. . Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicNevertheless, the Government, will continue to maintain close contact with the Fund staff on this issue, and will agree on the appropriate tax changes as soon as the draft proposals are available. 16. The Government will continue to monitor progress in economic policy implementation with respect to the quantitative and structural benchmarks incorporated in the program, taking account of the contingency mechanism with regard to additional donor financing and debt relief and with regard to the impact of the increase in coffee prices.above the program level on government finances and the minimum gross. reserve target. Regarding the outlook for 1995/96 and beyond, policies will continue to be formulated within the framework set forth in the policy framework paper attached to the Government's letter to the Managing Director 'of the Fund dated July 25, 1994. 17. To support the Government's strong adjustment efforts, technical assistance from the Fund will continue to be essential. A key priority will continue to be the fiscal area, particularly on the technical and institu- tional aspects of introducing the VAT, other aspects of improving the efficiency of the tax system, a-nd the enhancement of revenue mobilization. The other key area will be continued technical assistance to strengthen monetary management, particularly with regard to the treasury bill,market, .other aspects of capital markets development, and the BOU's role in the interbank market for.foreign exchange.. The Government will also be requesting technical assistance from the Fund to improve balance of payments statistics, particularly with regard to private transfers.

The primary obje,ctive of World Bank assistance to Uganda is to reduce poverty. To this end, the Bank's assistance strategy is designed to support the Government's efforts to sustain macroeconomic stability; raise the standard of public administration and improve the flow of public services, especially to poorer segments of the population; create the conditions necessary for the emergence of a strong private sector; and protect the environment. Within this strategy, it aims: (1) to assist the Government through economic work, technical assistance, and lending to increase the efficiency of economic management and rest0re.a sound basis for growth; (2) to promote the development of the economy by underpinning structural adjustment lending with infrastructure rehabilitation and sector adjustment operations (agriculture, industry, public enterprises, energy, public sector institutions, and finance) within a framework of appropriate policies; and (3) to act as the focal point for increased aid coordination among donors and between Uganda and donors. 2. As of December 31, 1994, the World Bank Group had approved 65 operations for Uganda totaling USS2.1 billion. The country's difficult political and economic situation has in the past affected many Bank Group-financed operations. However, the improved security situation and political stabi- lity have in recent years resulted in improved project execution and dis- bursement performance. The attached table contains the latest disbursement status of World Bank Group operations in Uganda.. 3. The lending program seeks to achieve a balance between investment projects and quick-disbursing import support. In view of the major dis- location of economic and social infrastructure during the prolonged period of political strife, recent Bank Group projects have emphasized rehabi- litation, maintenance, and institution investment building. The focus of investment lending is on growth (agriculture and infrastructure development) and improvement of the social indicators (human resource development). To this end, IDA has recently approved projects supporting agricultural ex- tension, agricultural research and training, and development of the cotton subsector, all of which have a strong focus on reducing poverty and improving the economic status of women in rural areas. IDA's Fifth Education Project is aimed mainly at improving primary education, while the Sexually Transmitted Xnfection project is designed to control the spread of AIDS and provide assistance to those infected with the virus. On the macroeconomic side, the Economic and Financial Management Project, which supports further strengthening of the core economic agencies, and the financial sector adjustment credit, aim to improve the legal and regulatory framework for financial intermediaries, and to strengthen the financial system.

Since 1987, Uganda has received six adjustment credits. The first two credits, ERC I and ERC II, have been fully disbursed. The first sector adjustment operation, the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit, is a hybrid operation with an adjustment component and a small investment component. All the major objectives of this credit have been largely achieved, and the credit is expected to be fully disbursed during 1995. ASAC was followed by the first Structural Adjustment Credit. The twin objectives of SAC I namely, enhancing private sector development and improving public sector management, have been achieved in'many respects, and this credit is now fully disbursed. The Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, which was approved .by the Board in May 1993, has experienced some delay in release of the second tranche due to slow progress on some of the financial sector restruc- turing measures. A second structural adjustment credit was approved on .'May 10, 1994, and the first tranche is now being disbursed. 5. Given the need to focus Uganda's public expenditures on only the highest-priority rehabilitation and maintenance activities and on making adequate provision for recurrent cost outlays, improved aid coordination has become an increasingly important aspect of the Bank's work in Uganda. In this regard, the Bank pursues its policy dialogue with Uganda in close collaboration with the IMF and other donors. The Bank chairs meetings of Uganda's Consultative Group, where the Government and donors review the main elements of the structural adjustment program. The most recent meeting was held in July 1994, to mobilize resources to support the 1994/95'program. Special meetings of SPA donors are convened twice a year (April and October) to further strengthen aid coordination., The next Consultative Group meeting is expected to take place in June or July 1995. t .: , ,. _. .’ ‘. .’ Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - _' UGAUDA : STATUS OF BAUK taouP oPERATIous , (contin~ ) A.

Real sector a. The ,availability'of new sources of information as well as better statistical techniques (developed by an advisor hired by the World Bank) are the main reasons underlying GDP revision in December 1994. The new sources ,: include information on household consumption as well as production of small- 'scale and household-based enterprises. A complete range of activities, including street hawkers, bicycle taxis, and manufacturers of local beers was made available by the completion of the 1992 Integrated Household Survey (IHS). The new series recorded higher real growth rates from 1991/92 through 1993/94 of 3.6 percent, 8.6 percent, and 5.1 percent, respectively (compared with the previous series of 2.6 percent, 7.2 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively). The new series record a decreasing trend in nonmonetary GDP of an average of 1.5 percent over the last three fiscal years,. compared with an average growth of 3.0 percent over the same period in the old series.. Additionally, as a percentage of total GDP, nonmonetary GDP fell from -34.6 percent in 1983/84 to 28.3 percent in 1993/94 (compared with 35.3 percent and 32.1 percent, respectively, in old series). These findings indicate the monetization of the economy. b. In the recent past, collection of data on employment and'wages has been neglected. The authorities are now making efforts to rebuild these series, which should be available within the current fiscal year. C. Data on wholesale prices for selected consumer goods and data on production of selected manufactured commodities were made available for the period 1990-94,. and will be published in the forthcoming recent economic developments (RED) paper for Uganda. d. The authorities made available the breakdown of GDP by expenditure for the period from 1981/82 through 1993/94. Though quite tentative in nature and in need of refinement, these estimates have been officially provided by the authorities for the first time and will be used as a basis for further technical discussions. 2. Bonetarv data' ' . The Research Department of the Bank of Uganda (BOU) produces monthly data on the monetary accounts of the banking system with a one-month lag. Detailed monthly trial balances and quarterly balance sheets of the BOU are available with a six-week lag. Although differences continue to emerge in the fiscal and central bank accounts of government operations, the author- ities are addressing this issue as a matter of priority, and they have established procedures for reconciling the accounts.

The BOU has addressed most of the issues raised by that mission, and implemented its recommendations. The monitoring of fiscal developments' has improved substantially since the creation of an Economic Analysis Unit in the Treasury in 1987; this unit was succeeded by the Macroeconomic Policy Department in 1992. However, the coverage of externally funded development expenditure is still problematic, and the Uganda country page was dropped from the mnt F'a Statistics Yearbook in 1992 for lack of data reporting. No data is available on the size and structure of local government operations funded outside of the central government budget. In light of current trends toward decentralization, indications are that the size of these operations will become significant. While some information is available on the activities of individual enterprises, no systematic data is collected on the public enterprise sector as a whole. As a result, it is at present very difficult to assess the impact of the sector's activities on the fiscal and monetary accounts. 4. Customs data on imports and exports are of very poor quality. Consequently, the authorities have ten&d to rely on exchange control' information and partner-country trade statistics. Beginning in August 1993, the authorities initiated new customs procedures for importers, which should have greatly strengthened the quality and comprehensiveness of available data. Currently, the summary balance of payments data that are compiled by the BOU are based on incomplete data on trade transactions and broad estimates of capital account movements. Key items, such as imports and private transfers, are calculated as a residual balancing item from exchange control documents received from foreign exchange bureaus. Fund technical assistance in the BOP area could be most productive once a good data base on trade statistics is established. In the meantime, Fund missions to Uganda will continue to assist the authorities to broaden the coverage of the BOP, and to identify items currently captured in private transfers. 5. Debt data Uganda has fairly good data on external debt and arrears, which are monitored and managed by the BOU's External Debt Management Office. Both the Pund and the World Bank have been working with the authorities in this area with a view to improving technical assistance to: (I) review the data base; (ii) develop an improved debt reporting system; (iii) monitor, on a timely basis, new commitments.

Their meeting took place in light of the Government's having maintained satisfactory relations with participating countries since the last Paris Club rescheduling agreement on June 17, 1992, because Uganda continues to have an appropriate arrangement with the Fund, and because of confidence in the capacity of the Government fully to service its debt to Paris Club creditors. Participating countries considered the terms given to constitute an exit rescheduling. Uganda became the first country to receive a stock of debt reduction under the new "Naples terms." In their terms of reference of February 20, 1995, participating creditors and the Government of Uganda reached agreement on a reduction and reorganization of the following debts: (i) all payments due under the consolidation agreements concluded or to be concluded according to the Agreed Minute dated June 19, 1987; and (ii) all payments due under the consolidation agreements concluded or to be concluded according to the Agreed.Minute dated January 26, 1989 (debt previously rescheduled on Toronto terms). The reduction and reorganization does not apply to debt service due as a result of the consolidation agreements concluded or to be concluded according to the Agreed Minute dated June 17, 1992 (debt previously rescheduled on-London terms), The object of the stock of debt reduction and reorganization is to effect a debt reduction equal to 67 percent in net present value terms according to one of two options. Under each option, the debt relief will apply to 100 percent of principal outstanding and principal and interest in arrears (including late interest), if any, of February 1, 1995. Under the first option (debt reduction), chosen by France, 67 percent of the debt outstanding from the consolidation agreements of June 19, 1987 will be canceled. The remaining 33 percent will be rescheduled or refi- nanced over a 23-year period, including a 6-year grace period (Table 1). Debt outstanding from the consolidation agreements of January 12, 1989 will be subject to cancellation of 50 percent, so as to achieve a "topping up" to + u The participating creditor countries were France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Also in attendance as observers were representatives from Austria, Finland, Germany, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States.

The rata and conditions of interest on the rescheduling or refinancing agreements will be determined bilaterally between Uganda and France on the basis of an appropriate market rate. Under the second option (debt service reduction), chosen by Italy and ,the United Kingdom, debt outstanding from the June 19, 1987 consolidation agreements will be rescheduled or refinanced over a three-year period at concessional interest rates so as to achieve a 67 percent debt reduction in net present value terms (Tables 1 and.2). Debt outstanding from the con- solidation agreements of January 12, 1989 will be rescheduled or refinanced 'over a 33-year period at concessional interest rates so as to achieve, once account is taken of the debt reduction already received under the Toronto terms rescheduling, a 67 percent debt reduction in net present value terms. &I a voluntary and bilateral basis, the Government of each partici- pating country or its appropriate institutions may sell or exchange in the framework of debt for nature, debt for aid, debt for equity swaps or other local currency swaps, outstanding ObA loans, direct government loans and other credits covered under the February 20, 1995 terms of reference, as well as up to 10 percent of the amounts of outstanding credits as of June 30, 1992, or up to an amount of US$2O million, whichever is higher. In order to secure comparable treatment of its debt to all its-external public or private creditors, the Government of Uganda will commit itself to seek promptly from all other external. creditors, including commercial banks and suppliers, debt reduction and reorganization arrangements on terms com- parable in net present value to those set forth in the terms of reference for credits of comparable maturity. The Government of Uganda will therefore commit itself to according all categories of creditors a treatment not more favorable than that accorded the participating creditor countries, Compara- bility of treatment for debt reduction in net present value is assessed not only on the basis of the reduction in the face value of the debt but also on the terms of repayment of the debts not canceled. 'If the participating creditor countries determine that the comparability of treatment between all external creditors is not obsemed, or that the Government of Uganda has not met its payment obligations as-set out in the terms of reference, the ,provisions of the debt reorganization and restructuring will become null and -void. Uganda agrees to pay the reorganized debt according to the terms of reference, and agrees that these debts will not be' restructured or reduced further. The provisions of the terms of reference do not apply to creditor countries with outstanding claims, including arrears, of less than SDR 1.1 million. Payments owed to these'countries are expected be made on u Under the debt reduction option on Toronto terms, 33 percent of consolidated debt service was canceled.

Payments already due.and not paid are expected to be made as soon as possible and, in any case," not later than July 31, 1995; interest will be charged on those amounts.. The Government of Uganda will undertake to pay all debt service due and not paid to participating countries or their appropriate institutions and not covered by the terms of reference as soon as possible, and in any case not later than July 31, 1995. Late interest will be charged on those amounts. All other matters involving the rescheduling or the refinancing of the debts will be set forth in the bilateral agreements, which the Government of Uganda and the governments of the participating countries or their appro- priate institutions will seek to conclude with the least delay, and in any case before October.31, ,199s. The debt reduction and reorganization under the terms of reference wilt enter into force when all bilateral agreements for the implementationof the Agreed Minute dated June 17, 1992 are concluded. . . . I. I _ < Overall, the totai. debt stock subject to the reorganiiation and reduction under the terms of reference amounts to an estimated US$lll mil- lion. Of this amount, USS62.3 million is subject to the 67 percent cancellation or reduction in net present value terms, and USS48.4 million is subject to the 50 percent cancellation or topping up.of the reduction in net present value terms, On this basis, debt service relief from the Paris Club in 1994/95 is estimated to be USS12.5 million. Assuming comparable treatment by other creditors, the amount of debt relief in 1994/95 is estimated at US$22i.million, which is sufficient to close the financing , gap for the year. 4 . I ‘. ., . .
