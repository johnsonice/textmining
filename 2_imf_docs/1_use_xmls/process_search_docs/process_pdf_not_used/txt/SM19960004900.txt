Policy issues 0 The acceleration of inflationary and balance of payments pressures need to be addressed in 1996 through a more realistic and flexible exchange rate policy, and tighter financial policies. A continuation of the policy of avoiding quantitative restrictions will also be important. l The 1996 budget needs to be tightened; particularly worrisome is the continued increase in nonproductive expenditures. Budgetary operations should be managed on a cash-flow basis, to avoid monetary financing and a further accumulation of arrears. 0 Progress should be made in undertaking the preparatory work for the structural reforms of the financial, coffee, and public enter- prise sectors to facilitate their implementation when circumstances permit. 0 Ongoing audits of financial institutions and a plan to restructure the financial sector, with attention to avoiding excessive budgetary costs and monetary expansion, should be finalized as soon as possible. 0 Interministerial coordination of policy implementation needs to be strengthened.

Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Burundi were held in Bujumbura during November 28-December 10. I/ The mission met with Mr. Nduwayo, Prime Minister; Mr. Niyibigira, Minister of Development Planning and Reconstruction; Mr. Toyi, Minister of Finance; Mr. Buhanga, Minister of Mining and Energy; Mr. Nahimana, Minister of Agriculture; Mr. Sinzoyiheba, Minister of Defense; Ms. Matuturu, Minister for the Reinsertion and Resettlement of Refugees and Displaced Persons; Mr. SinAenye, Governor of the Bank of the Republic of Burundi; and other senior officials in charge of economic and financial matters. The mission also met with representatives of the private sector and of the international donor community. A three-year ESAF arrangement for Burundi, in an amount equivalent to SDR 42.7 million (74.7 percent of quota), was approved on November 13, 1991. The midterm review under the second annual arrangement could not be complet- ed because of the upheaval that followed the assassination, in October 1993, of the first democratically elected President of Burundi. The commitment period under the three-year ESAF arrangement expired on November 12, 1994 with an amount of SDR 23.5 million (41.1 percent of quota) unused. Burundi has met its financial obligations to the Fund in a timely manner. The 1994 Article IV consultation with Burundi was concluded by the Executive Board on September 6, 1994 (EBS/94/211 and SUR/94/102). At that time, Executive Directors expressed concern that the progress that had been made on the macroeconomic and structural fronts had been disrupted by political instability and ethnic violence. They welcomed the progress that was being made toward political reconciliation at that time and stressed that the stabilization of Burundi's economy required disciplined financial policies and that the process of medium-term structural reforms should be resumed as soon as possible. At the request of the authorities, discussions were held with a staff team in Geneva in April 1995 to assess Burundi's economic situation and assist the new coalition Government in formulating a macroeconomic policy framework for 1995. The staff of the Fund and the World Bank have collaborated closely on Burundi. Burundi continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2, but no longer retains any exchange restric- tions thereunder. Summaries of Burundi's relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are provided in Appendices I and II, respectively. Burundi maintains a data base of core economic statistics and has provided surveillance data to the Fund with a lag of two to four months for most categories of data (Appendix III). However, there remain several L/ The staff team consisted of Messrs. J.A.P. Clement (head), N. Krichene, P. Peroz, and R. Randriamaholy (all AFR); Mr. Nankobogo from the World Bank participated in most of the discussions.

Moreover, the recent departure of civil servants and of foreign experts, owing to the worsening security situation, has adversely affected the timeliness and quality of data. Current weaknesses in the &ta base make more difficult a meaningful assessment of economic policies. Social and demographic indicators are provided in Appendix IV. II. Political and Economic Setting 1. Political situation The civil conflict, now in its third year, has exerted a severe toll on Burundi's already fragile economy. Although there have been efforts to reestablish political reconciliation and democratic rule since 1993, extremists from the two major ethnic groups (Tutsis 15 percent and Hutus 80 percent) have continued to engage in violence. Moreover, despite courageous efforts by a few key personalities, mistrust is widespread among the political parties. So far, the Tutsi-dominated army has had limited success in gaining the trust of the population at large and insecurity is widespread, particularly in the northern provinces. Well-armed militias have disrupted transportation and power supply in Bujumbura, and damaged other infrastructure. As a result, the bulk of industrial production in the country, located around the capital, has come to a standstill. Moreover, the departure (or killings) of national civil servants and foreign technical experts has stalled most investment projects and adversely affected public administration. Humanitarian aid, after a sharp rise in the last several years, is expected to decline in 1996 due in part to the security situation and it is feared that famine might develop in certain parts of the country. Social indicators show a sharp deterioration in living conditions: increasing malnutrition; disruptions in medical care; a sharp fall in immunization rates; emerging epidemics; and declining access to primary and secondary education. A large majority of the population is estimated to live below the poverty line. 2. Recent economic develonments The economic and financial situation has worsened markedly since 1993, exacerbated by a growing number of refugees (about 400,000) and displaced persons (550,000) in a population of about 5.5 million. Since 1993, real GDP has fallen by more than 16 percent cumulatively (Table 1 and Chart l), and real GDP in 1995 was about the same level as that of the mid-1980s. Real income and private consumption per capita have plummeted. Output of the primary sector has plunged. The production of food crops declined by about a fourth during the last two years, in a country that is normally self sufficient in food and where more than 90 percent of the population lives on agriculture. All crops were adversely affected by the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 3 - departure of farmers from their lands, the lack of maintenance of fields, and continued soil erosion. In certain regions, livestock was abandoned, causing considerable damage to the remaining cultivated lands. As a result, Burundi has had to rely on humanitarian aid for about 10 percent of normal food crop production. In contrast to food crops, the production of export crops --coffee and tea--has performed well (albeit with a decrease in quality), benefiting from favorable weather conditions and international prices. Output of the manufacturing sector has also fallen sharply. In particular, the situation of public enterprises, a major employer in the formal sector, has deteriorated. The tertiary sector has also been adverse- ly affected by the prevailing situation, although to a lesser extent because of aid-related activities. Consumer prices rose sharply, to an annual rate of about 19 percent in 1995, reflecting food shortages and the rapid expansion in the money supply. IJ The compression in domestic demand and a sharp improvement in the terms of trade had a positive impact on the balance of payments in 1994 and 1995. Exports increased markedly, thanks to a bumper coffee crop and a sharp increase in coffee export prices. While private imports and public invest- ment-related imports contracted, emergency aid imports--food and medical supplies-- increased sharply and were financed by grants. The external current account deficit, excluding grants, fell from 20 percent of GDP in 1993 to 17 percent in 1995. Including grants, the external current account turned from a deficit of 3 percent of GDP in 1993 to a surplus of 1 percent in 1995 (Table 2). Net capital inflows dropped considerably as a result of a sharp decrease in investment project and budgetary program financing. Nonetheless, the overall balance of payments recorded surpluses amounting to about US$44 million in 1994 and US$lO million in 1995. Taking into account the accumulation of external payments arrears, amounting to USS4.1 million in 1994 and USS5.2 million in 1995, net international reserves increased from four months of imports of goods and non-factor services in 1993 to six months in 1995. In the past two years, Burundi has experienced difficulties in servicing its external debt- -of which 86 percent is owed to multilateral institutions, including about 4 percent to the Fund. With the deterioration of the fiscal position and a tight liquidity situation in the treasury, external payments arrears were accumulated, tarnishing Burundi's timely debt servicing record. The outstanding stock of external payments arrears is estimated at US$9 million at end-1995. The debt service to exports of good and nonfactor services stood at about 40 percent in 1995 and the ratio of external debt to GDP at 108 percent at end-1995; and in percent of govern- ment revenue, these ratios were 26 percent and 576 percent, respectively. l/ Inflation is measured in terms of the consumer price index for Bujumbura. Indices outside Bujumbura are not available (even though more than 90 percent of the population lives in the countryside). It is likely that inflation in the countryside was somewhat lower than in Bujumbura.

Nevertheless, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by about 15 percent in the last two years. More- over, as the official rate has not been adjusted to fully reflect market pressures, the differential between the official and parallel rates widened to about 25 percent in 1995, despite a 15 percent cumulative depreciation of the official rate over the past two years (Chart 2). 3. Financial nolicies The public finances have continued to deteriorate during 1994-95 (Table 3). While the overall fiscal deficit (on a commitment basis, and excluding grants) is estimated to have declined from 13 percent of GDP in 1993 to 7 percent in 1994 and 1995, domestic bank financing increased, and domestic and external payments arrears accumulated as foreign financing declined. These arrears are estimated to amount to more than 2 percent of GDP at end-1995. Without the appropriation by the Government of a large share of the surplus of the coffee stabilization fund, the fiscal position would have been even worse. Total revenue, excluding grants, increased from 17 percent of GDP in 1993 to 19 percent in 1995, on account of higher coffee receipts. A number of revenue measures--estimated to yield about 1 percent of GDP annually-- were implemented during 1994-95, consistent with the recommendations of technical assistance from the Fund, and aimed at compensating a shrinking noncoffee tax base. I-J However, a potential loss of revenue estimated at 0.3 percentage point of GDP annually resulted from the introduction of a two-year tax exemption on the cotton company (a major public enterprise) and on imports of commercial vehicles. Total expenditure fell from 30 percent of GDP in 1993 to 26 percent in 1995. The structure of expenditure deteriorated, however, as development and capital expenditures, mainly foreign-financed, were cut sharply. Current expenditure remained at about 17 percent of GDP, but there was a strong increase in security-related expenditure, equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP. Extrabudgetary expenditure, partly related to security, continued, pointing to a weakening of expenditure monitoring and control. In addition, the closure of the third largest commercial bank, with related budgetary outlays equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP, further strained the JJ These measures included a 20 percent transaction tax on imports of textile products; an increase in the service tax on imports from 4 percent to 6 percent; an increase in the fees on the customs bonded warehouses; an increase in the fines on customs fraud; an increase in the transaction tax on services from 7 percent to 15 percent; the replacement of the specific tax on cigarettes by an ad valorem tax of 43 percent; and a reduction of the maximum tariff on imports from 100 percent to 70 percent.

In view of the rapid deterioration in the fiscal situation, a freeze has been imposed on all new commitments, excluding salaries and military outlays, since July 1995. The growth of broad money accelerated sharply to 35 percent in 1994, reflecting the increase in net foreign assets and rapid domestic credit expansion (Table 4). The growth of domestic credit was mainly on account the sharp increase in credit to the Government and to public enterprises, many of which faced financial difficulties. Credit to the private sector was extended mainly to finance a bumper coffee crop. Deposit and lending rates became negative in real terms, u and currency holdings increased markedly, suggesting the constitution of precautionary balances and the emergence of financial disintermediation-- a trend that amplified during 1995. of Monetary indicators for 1995 should be interpreted with care, as they were largely influenced by the closure of the third largest commercial bank, the Meridien BIAO Bank Burundi (MBB) in May 1995 (Box 1). Broad money is estimated to have declined by 4 percent. The closure of the MBB resulted in the freezing of a large amount of deposits and was the main factor under- lying the decrease of broad money. Reflecting the continued weakening of domestic demand, domestic credit fell markedly and net foreign assets continued to increase. The portfolios of commercial banks and other financial institutions deteriorated; without central bank refinancing, a few of them would have been forced to close. In line with the recommendations of the 1993 Fund technical assistance mission, the authorities introduced measures to improve monetary management and increase the use of indirect instruments during 1994-95. In particular, to enhance the role of the discount rate, the monetary authorities have abolished automatic recourse by banks to refinancing and refinancing on new loans at original rates. The outstanding stock of refinancing at original rates was eliminated at end-November 1995. The authorities no longer set a reference rate when conducting treasury bills operations beyond which bids are not accepted. In contrast, progress in monetary programming has been slower, owing to the departure of key bank staff as well as to the delay in the arrival of a foreign expert on account of the security situation. 4. Structural nolicies Structural reforms stalled in most areas during 1994-95. This was particularly evident in the public enterprise sector, where there were delays in the implementation of measures envisaged under the privatization and restructuring program defined in 1992 with the assistance of the World Bank. The envisaged increases in prices and tariffs of certain public u Deposit and lending rates are freely determined. The setting of the rediscount rate is linked to the treasury certificate rates, which also reflect market forces.

Deposits in the MBB (of which 17 percent was owed to indivi- duals, 29 percent to public enterprises, 43 percent to public finan- cial institutions, and 11 percent to private enterprises) accounted for 20 percent of total bank deposits and 15 percent of broad money. Total credit of the MBB amounted to 20 percent of total bank credit, mainly to private enterprises. 0 To contain the effects of the closure of the MBB on the rest of the financial system, the Government redeemed small private deposi- tors, the equivalent of 100 percent of their deposits (5 percent of 1995 broad money stock). In addition, the Central Bank redeemed 60 percent of deposits of state-owned financial institutions (1 percent of 1995 broad money stock). 0 Weaknesses of deposit-taking institutions were evident in a number of financial indicators for December 1993-June 1995: (i) the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans increased from 13 percent to 25 percent, (ii) the capital adequacy ratio--defined as capital, reserves, nondistributed profits, and current profits to total assets --fell from 10 percent to a negative value of 2 percent, (iii) banks' profitability, defined as the ratio of net profits to equity, decreased by 4 percentage points, to 1 percent. With the recent strengthening of supervision by the Central Bank, the ratio of provisions to nonperforming loans increased from 47 percent to 78 percent. The liquidity ratio, defined as liquid assets to total liabilities, improved from 17 percent to 24 percent. However, the liquidity position of several banks is likely to have deteriorated sharply in the second half of 1995. 0 The situation of non-deposit-taking financial institutions, all government-owned, was also worrisome. These institutions usually financed infrastructure and housing. Much of the physical collateral, however, was destroyed or damaged in the past two years. Moreover, these institutions had substantial deposits with the MBB. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - enterprises, especially water and electricity rates, were postponed. Consequently, the financial situation of the public enterprise sector worsened considerably, leading to a web of payments arrears among these enterprises and with the Government. However, some progress was made, albeit with considerable delay, on the legal front, with the adoption in late 1995 by the Parliament of a new and simplified privatization law and the new commercial code for public and private enterprises. The effective- ness of the new code was weakened, however, by an amendment that made compulsory the nomination of the director of each public enterprise by the Government. The privatization program envisaged in the coffee sector has also been stopped and no progress has been made in more directly linking producer prices with international prices. The inefficient pricing system, together with distortionary taxation, has negatively affected the quality of coffee and encouraged smuggling (Box 2). In further liberalizing external current transactions, Burundi removed in December 1995 the two remaining exchange restrictions (namely limits on the transfer of rental income and on the granting of travel allowances), that had been maintained under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2 of the Fund Articles of Agreements. III. ReDort on the Discussions The consultation discussions took place against the backdrop of escalating violence in the ethnic conflict, which has set off a new massive displacement of the population and rendered many key regions inaccessible. The conflict has also led to a major withdrawal of foreign financial and technical assistance. During the conference of the "Friends of Burundi" in November 1995, donors stated that resumption of assistance would depend on achieving national reconciliation. 1. Short-term outlook Barring a rapid improvement in the political situation lJ and taking into account the cyclical fall in coffee production (by about 30 percent) as well as the decrease in quality, the macroeconomic outlook for 1996 is bleak. Real GDP is likely to continue to fall; income per capita will continue to decline, further impoverishing the population and exacerbating political instability. The production of food crops is expected to decline further, and the food deficit will continue to widen. Production in the manufacturing sector, including coffee processing, will continue to suffer from the lack of power. Pressures on consumer prices are likely to u The consensus view of the diplomatic, donor, and domestic and foreign communities was increasingly skeptical of the possibility of a compromise in the short term.

Coffee production averaged 7 percent of GDP and coffee exports accounted for 80 percent of total exports during 1994-95. Burundi's higher quality coffee has traditionally earned a premium above the international market price; however, the share of high quality coffee fell from 64 percent in 1993 to 24 percent in 1995 owing to the security situation and inadequate producer pricing and taxation policies. 0 About 60 percent of production in 1995 was sold to five publicly owned washing companies called SOGESTALs; some of the washing stations were damaged during 1994-95. All coffee that is processed by the washing stations or by the producers themselves is sold to a publicly owned hulling company (Socibte de Dbparchage et de Condition- nement SODECO), and then surrendered to the "Office du Cafe du Burundi (OCIBU)". Coffee exports have been marketed freely through auctions held by OCIBU with participation of private exporters and the state- owned company, Burundi Coffee Company, once the sole exporter of coffee. 0 The payment system is based on a remuneration scale that attributes a fixed price to producers and fixed fees covering costs and profits for the washing and hulling operations. The remuneration scale is usually announced before the start of the coffee campaign. Official producer prices have not been changed since 1993 and were equivalent to about 25 percent of export prices in 1995. The tax rate on coffee exports was increased from an average of 9 percent in 1993 to a flat rate of 31 percent in 1994 and 1995. The difference between coffee export receipts and costs is held in a coffee stabilization fund managed by OCIBU. The fund is required to keep a minimum of reserves equal to FBu 1 billion. In the past, deficits have been financed by transfers from the Government and foreign aid. Taking into account the appropriation of part of the stabilization fund surplus by the Government in 1995, or FBu 11 billion out of FBu 16 billion, the effective tax rate on coffee exports is estimated at about 44 percent in 1995. The coffee campaign is financed through commercial bank credit, which is allocated among banks by a bank consortium. Exporters are also allowed to borrow abroad. 0 The strategy for liberalizing the coffee sector, as discussed with the World Bank, involves the privatization of the coffee processing industries and the freeing of the producer price.

The fiscal position is expected to deteriorate further, making monetary control difficult, and negatively affecting inflation and the balance of payments. Given the extreme volatility of Burundi's situation and the weakening of the administrative capacity, including in maintaining a basic economic data base, it was not possible to undertake either meaningful medium-term balance of payments projections or a reasonable debt sustainability analysis. However, as soon as the situation returns to normal, medium-term policies are more clearly defined, and sufficient data becomes available, the staff intends to assess the medium-term balance of payments outlook and the issue of debt sustainability in coordination with the World Bank and the Burundi authorities. The staff stressed the gravity of the situation. It emphasized that without return to a more stable political and social environment, the country would be mired in a deeper financial and economic crisis. Accord- ingly , it urged the authorities to explore all possible avenues to end the current political crisis and to take the measures needed to cope with the financial difficulties. The authorities concurred with the staff's analysis, but noted that Burundi was undergoing an exceptionally difficult period in its history. They said that it was the Government's intention to reestablish security through national dialogue as well as through military action when warranted. They pointed out that a majority of the population was striving for peace but that extremists in both ethnic groups were advocating violence. One of the main steps the authorities will be taking is to buttress the judiciary in order to end the impunity of advocates of violence. In that context, they noted that the Government was cooperating with a United Nations commission that was investigating the October 1993 assassination of the President and several other officials. The authorities pleaded for the noninterruption of the support of the international donor community at this crucial juncture. They emphasized that the Government would continue to implement reforms where feasible during this transition period, so as to pave the way for an adjustment program that could, in due course, be supported by the international community. The staff stressed the need to adopt a broad macroeconomic framework for 1996 as soon as circumstances permit, with policies that aimed at containing inflationary and balance of payments pressures and a restrained monetary expansion, including strict limits on the Government's net recourse from the banking system. 2. Fiscal nolicv The 1996 budget, approved by Parliament at end-1995, makes little progress toward fiscal sustainability (Table 3). Moreover, in the staff's view, the budget's projections are also based on unrealistic assumptions. Revenue, excluding grants, is overestimated by about 3 percent of GDP on account of an assumption of higher economic growth. Total expenditure Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - continues to show a decreasing share of developmental expenditure and a rising share of military outlays, including the recruitment of 2,000 new soldiers. The current balance is likely to post a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP, instead of showing a surplus of about 3 percent as budgeted. The budget's underestimation on the current deficit is largely offset by an overestimation on capital expenditure. The staff has calculated that the overestimation amounts to about 3 percent of GDP, taking into account the low rate of implementation of the 1995 investment budget, the deteriorating administrative capacity, the lack of counterpart funds, and the expected sharp cut in foreign financing. Overall, and taking into account both the need to eliminate part of the accumulated payments arrears and no net recourse to the banking system, the staff estimates that the budget will lead to a financing gap of about 4 percent of GDP. Given the above, the staff stressed that action--including improving the structure of expenditures --was needed to move toward a sustainable fiscal position. Toward that end, the staff urged the authorities to implement measures to increase revenue and curtail expenditure, particularly military outlays and expenses related to representation abroad. It also recommended that the budget be reviewed and executed on a cash-flow basis; in the event that revenue falls short of planned, the Minister of Finance should be authorized to freeze commitments of expenditures excluding debt service payments. To improve expenditure control, the staff encouraged the authorities to consolidate all expenditure in the budget and make the Minister of Finance the sole authorizing minister; equally important would be to use counterpart funds within the normal budgetary process. The staff also stressed the need to define a more realistic public investment program (PIP), with assistance from the World Bank, which should be integrated in due time in a well-defined development strategy with clear priorities. The staff cautioned the authorities not to undertake investment projects for short-term gains in stimulating activity, which, with a return to a more normal situation, could prove extremely costly. The staff urged the authorities to seek external financing in the form of grants and loans on highly concessional terms. The authorities acknowledged that the budget had been based on assumptions regarding growth that in retrospect appeared too optimistic. The authorities said that a number of revenue measures would be introduced in early 1996 to compensate for the shrinking tax base. These include an excise tax of 30 percent on gasoline and a transaction tax of 10 percent on other petroleum products; a transaction tax on electricity and water; an increase in the flat rate on income of informal sector operators; and a strengthening of the repayment by public enterprises of on-lent credits. They agreed to monitor the budget on a cash-flow basis, continuing a practice that had been in effect since July 1995. On the expenditure side, the authorities noted that reestablishing security was a major goal and therefore that a strong army was needed. Moreover, new recruitment will also serve to increase the participation of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - Hutus in a still Tutsi-dominated army. With the return to a more normal situation, the authorities indicated their commitment to reducing military outlays and increasing the share of developmental expenditure. The author- ities added that the need to provide for the basic needs of refugees and displaced persons has placed an additional burden on expenditure. 3. Monetary policy The staff stressed that restrained monetary policy was needed to reduce inflationary pressures. Overall, broad money should increase by less than projected nominal GDP growth, with an increase in credit to the economy and a limited drawdown of international reserves. In addition to strictly limiting central bank financing of public sector imbalances, interest rates will need to be kept at a positive level in real terms to avoid financial disintermediation. The staff encouraged the authorities to use the discount rate and open market operations more actively and to change reserve requirements as needed. The staff also noted the deteriorating situation of the banking system, with a few banks and other financial institutions no longer being profit- able. It advised that urgent actions be taken to restructure the financial system and forestall a financial crisis. In that regard, it urged the authorities to apply the existing reserve requirements forcefully, as well as to monitor closely the observance of prudential ratios. The authorities were encouraged to extend the audits to the entire financial system. The staff also urged the authorities to make every effort to avoid excessive budgetary costs and monetary expansion when taking measures to address problems in the financial system. It stressed the need to maintain a cautious restraint on the granting of central bank refinancing. The authorities were increasingly aware of the difficulties of the financial system and noted that a number of measures had been taken. In particular, the monetary authorities have strengthened the monitoring of the observance of reserve ratios and toughened penalties for nonobservance. The authorities'are also monitoring more closely the prudential ratios for all financial institutions. On the basis of the audits of the major banks and other financial institutions, which are being finalized with the assistance of the World Bank, a restructuring plan is scheduled to be drawn in the first half of 1996. In the meantime, the authorities had redeemed part of the deposits at the MBB pending the results of the audits. The authorities asked for technical assistance from the Fund to strengthen the supervision and control of the financial system as well as to enhance monetary programming. 4. Structural and external oolicies In discussing structural reforms, the authorities generally concurred with the staff's view that progress with reforms had stalled in the past two years. They stressed, however, that this was mainly due to the difficult political and social situation that had rendered bolder reforms unfeasible. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - They indicated their preparedness to push ahead in those areas that were feasible during this period; an interministerial committee had been established to monitor the implementation of structural reforms. The staff stressed that the resumption of public enterprise reforms was important for establishing the basis for sustained growth. The lack of progress in the last two years had aggravated the problems in a number of enterprises with negative effects on both the economy and the public finances. The staff urged the authorities to avoid granting direct or indirect subsidies but instead to accelerate the needed reforms, including the increase of tariffs and official prices in line with production costs. The authorities observed that the recent adoption of the new commerce code and the law on privatization as well as the creation of an inter- ministerial committee for privatization provided a legal framework to resume rapidly the restructuring of the sector. They noted that the nomination of directors of public enterprises by the Government had been decided with a view to achieving equitable distribution of management posts between the two ethnic groups. In the current circumstances, the authorities considered that raising the tariffs and official prices of key goods and services, such as electricity and water, would exacerbate an already fragile social fabric. They indicated, however, that as soon as the situation returned to normal, official prices and tariffs would be raised gradually to cover costs. The staff noted that while progress had been made in reforming the coffee sector, including the selling of coffee exports freely at auctions, further reforms had also stalled in the last two years. Measures are needed to further liberalize the sector, particularly the freeing of producer prices and reducing the high level of effective taxation of coffee exports. An audit of the stabilization fund was also needed. The authorities agreed with the need to resume liberalization of the coffee sector. They indicated their intention to revise coffee taxation. In discussing external policies, the authorities stressed their determination not to resort to quantitative restrictions in the face of balance of payments pressures. They also indicated their intention to comply with the Cross Border Initiatives (CBI) regarding the rationalization of the external tariff structure as well as the deregulation of investment as soon as the situation permits. The staff welcomed the removal of the two remaining exchange restrictions that Burundi had maintained under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2. The authorities indicated their intention to consider in due course Burundi's acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. With regard to the exchange rate, the staff observed that the implementation of the present exchange system has led to an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate and a widening premium in the parallel market. In view of likely real shocks-- such as weak agricultural production prospects and a possible decline in coffee prices--and the resulting Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - acceleration in inflation, consideration should be given to a more flexible adjustment of the exchange rate, buttressed by disciplined financial policies, to safeguard competitiveness and return to a unified rate. The authorities agreed with the staff and expressed interest in a more flexible exchange rate arrangement; they also requested technical assistance from the Fund to discuss the institutional requirements of such a system. 5. Statistical issues The authorities recognized that the departure of civil servants and foreign technical experts as well as frequent strikes had affected negatively the statistical system, in particular with respect to national accounts, the balance of payments, and to a certain extent public finances and monetary statistics. The authorities intend to ask for technical assistance from the international community to buttress their statistical system including, where feasible, assistance from the Fund. IV. Staff Appraisal Burundi needs to avoid increasing confrontation between the two main ethnic groups that could end in chaos with terrible economic and human costs, and move toward restraint and reconciliation. Burundi has already lost, in terms of real GDP, a decade of development since 1993. Urgent actions are needed on all fronts to reverse the rapid deterioration in the economic and financial situation. 0 First and foremost is the need to reestablish domestic and external confidence, through a return to a more stable political and social environment. 0 More restrained macroeconomic policies will have to be pursued. In particular, budgetary imbalances will have to be significantly reduced over the medium term to strengthen the balance of payments, phase out domestic and external arrears, and alleviate the debt burden. At the same time, attention will also have to be given to reconstruction, and the resettling of refugees and displaced persons. The 1996 budget, which is based on too optimistic assumptions regarding growth and the taxable base, will need to be reviewed and managed on a cash-flow basis, linking expenditure to available domestic and foreign resources so as to avoid monetary financing and a further accumulation of arrears. Tax collection will need to be strengthened and revenue measures introduced to increase tax buoyancy. The authorities should be commended for the measures recently introduced toward that end. Cuts are also needed on the expenditure side, particularly nonproductive expenditures. Capital expenditure should be rationalized, with the assistance of the World Bank, taking into account the financing constraints and reconstruction and development priorities. A transparent system of accounting for inflows of foreign assistance and related expenditure should be put in place.

The monetary authorities should be commended for having implemented most of the last Fund technical assistance recommenda- tions on developing indirect instruments, but these instruments ought to be used more actively, along with a strengthening of monetary programming. Given the deterioration of the financial sector's situation, audits of all financial institutions should be finalized as soon as possible and a plan designed to restructure the banks in difficulties, with the assistance of the international community. In the meantime, the authorities are encouraged to continue to reinforce their supervision of the financial system. 0 Preparatory work for structural reforms, which are key to establishing the basis for the resumption of growth, will have to be accelerated in most areas, particularly concerning the restructuring of public enterprises. The staff welcomes the establishment of an inter- ministerial committee in charge of structural reforms and the progress made, albeit with delay, on the legal front, with the adoption of a simplified privatization law and a new commercial law. The staff noted that further delays in raising prices and tariffs would only aggravate public sector imbalances. The staff also urges the authorities to resume the liberali- zation of the coffee sector to maintain the traditionally high quality of Burundi's coffee. Regarding the data base, the staff urged the authorities to take actions to address the current weaknesses; it welcomed the authorities' intention to request technical assistance to this end. l On the external side, the staff welcomes the determination of the authorities not to resort to quantitative restrictions in the face of balance of payments pressures. The staff commends the authorities for the removal of the two remaining restrictions under the transitional arrange- ments of Article XIV, Section 2. The staff encourages Burundi to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund's Articles of Agreement, as soon as circumstances permit. The authorities are also urged to implement a more flexible exchange rate policy to enhance competitiveness and return to a unified rate. In this regard, the staff welcomes the authorities' request for Fund technical assistance to discuss the institutional requirements of a more flexible exchange rate arrangement. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation discussions with Burundi be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Article IV Consultation Burundi is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. Discussions for the 1994 Article IV consultation were held with the staff in Bujumbura during the period May 1-12, 1994. The staff report (SM/94/211, 8/10/94) was discussed by the Executive Board on September 6, 1994. The Executive Board's decision was as follows: 1. The Fund takes this decision in concluding the 1994 Article XIV consultation with Burundi, in the light of the 1994 Article IV consultation with Burundi conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in SM/94/211, Burundi continues to maintain exchange restrictions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, in the form of limits on the transfer of rental income, and on the granting of travel allowances. The Fund urges Burundi to eliminate these restrictions as soon as possible. IX. Technical Assistance 1990: FAD mission on taxation of coffee exports. 1991: ETR/AFR mission on exchange system options.

Statement of IFC Investments (As of December 1995) In 1981, IFC committed a loan amounting to USS5.9 million to Verreries du Burundi, a glass container manufacturer. USS4.6 million has been repaid and USSO. was written off. The loan portion has been fully reimbursed, and IFC still holds the US$l million equity portion, which is not salable due to the poor performance of this public enterprise. Structural Adiustment Proaram Burundi's structural reform program was supported through three strut- tural adjustment credits in 1986-92, totaling US$135 million. The last one was partially canceled in June 1995, as the reform program was derailed by political transition and civil unrest. These operations supported: trade and change liberalization, including the introduction of an OGL system in 1992 and the reduction of effective protection through tariff reform; the introduction of public investment programming and a modern public accounting system; the reallocation of public expenditure to improve the provision of basic education and health; the liberalization of producer prices; the re- form of state-owned enterprises; and a more liberal environment for private enterprises, including greater latitude in hiring and firing of personnel. Investment Lendina Proaram Of total current IDA investment lending to Burundi, 39 percent is for infrastructure, 28 percent for agriculture, 15 percent for industry and energy, 12 percent for human resources, and 6 percent for emergency assistance. 1. Current Bank-financed operations in infrastructure include transportation, urban development, and water supply projects. The Bank is helping develop opportunities in artisanal activities, improve sanitation and water supply in secondary urban centers, and improve rural living conditions through access to safe drinking water. 2. In aFriculture, the Bank-financed portfolio is being restructured to improve results on the ground, enhance responsiveness to farmers' needs, and support private sector investment. Investment activities are being con- solidated into two highly focused operations: (1) the Agricultural Services Project, which supports the strengthening of extension and research ser- vices, and rebuilding sector capacities; and (ii) the Agribusiness Promotion Project, which supports private sector investment in agroindustries. Should the Government decide to proceed with the privatization of the coffee sec- tor, the latter component would support this reform, since the Coffee Sector Project is expected to close at end-July 1996. In addition to investment lending activities, the Bank will continue to foster dialogue on sector strategy and sectoral expenditure programming, improve donor coordination, and lay the basis for sector-wide investment operation.

In industrv and enerzv sectors, IDA finances three operations: (i) an energy rehabilitation project to finance key investments and support the privatization of the power company; (ii) a private sector development project aimed at promoting private investment by onlending through com- mercial banks and other financial institutions, and helping improve the business environment; and (iii) a telecommunications project designed to strengthen the operation of the public telephone utility. 4. In ponulation and human resource sectors, the Bank finances: (i) a second population and health project, which focuses on sector policy reform to alleviate financial constraints facing the health sector, by contributing to the expansion and effectiveness of family planning programs, and strengthening health sector management to render it more efficient, more equitable, and more responsive to the population needs in a context of socioeconomic adjustment. Quantitative objectives include a contraceptive prevalence rate of 10 percent and revenues from the health insurance card equivalent to 30 percent of the Ministry of Health recurrent expenditures at the end of the project (December 31, 2000); (ii) a social action project which, within the global goal of poverty alleviation: (a) encourages a broad participation of the population in small-scale productive activities, and assists beneficiaries through the provision of basic social services and rehabilitation of infrastructure by putting in place a social fund; (b) fosters local and NGO participation in the development process; and (c) monitors the country's social situation as a means to improve the Government's economic and social policy formulation and implementation. The project was restructured in September 1995 to better respond to the deteriorating country situation and is focusing on the rehabilitation of social infrastructure (schools, health centers, feeder roads, etc.) relying more on NGOs for implementation. 5. In emernencv assistance, IDA has committed a credit of USS14.6 million (the Emergency Assistance Project, RAP, F'Y 1995) to help improve economic and social conditions for sustained growth. This credit helps finance the Emergency Recovery Program (ERP) that the Government prepared (with the help of the Bank) in late 1994. About 65 percent of IDA funds have been disbursed as of December 1995, and the project is scheduled to close at end-August 1996.

The authorities are aware of these deficiencies and intend to request technical assistance from the international community to buttress their statistical system, including, where feasible, assistance from the Fund. 1. Outstanding statistical issues a. Real sector Real sector data are not reported to STA by the "Banque de la Republique du Burundi" on a regular basis. However, STA makes extensive use of the statistical bulletin published by the "Banque de la Rdpublique du Burundi" to update information on a current basis. b. Government finance Monthly data on central government operations are available in IFS through July 1995, and on external debt through June 1995. However, more detailed GFS data suitable for publication in GFSY are very uncurrent. Therefore, data for Burundi were discontinued from publication after the 1991 GFSY -- The mission has encouraged the authorities to provide revised GFS data and updates, so that Burundi could be reinstated in the GFSY of 1996. C. Monetarv accounts Data for deposit money banks (which consist of commercial banks and other monetary institutions) are not current. In the February 1996 issue of IFS, the latest available data for commercial banks are through September 1995, and complete data for other monetary institutions are available only through 1990. The mission has discussed these issues with the authorities and encouraged them to establish regular monthly reporting of money and banking data for publication in IFS. d. Interest rates Interest rate data are not current. In the February 1996 issue of IFS, the latest reported data are through 1988. e. Balance of navments None. 2. Technical assistance missions in statistics (1992-nresent) None. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public@ 0 3 2 z iii .r! c) .9 3 rA 2 s I .d % ?
