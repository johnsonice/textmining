INTRODUCTION 1. The 1999 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Ashgabat during the period June 29-July 14, 1999.’ A staff team2 met with the Deputy Heads of Cabinet Messrs. Orazov (Economic Affairs), Gurbanmuradov (Oil and Gas), and Babayev (Agriculture); the Chairman of the Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT), Mr. Kandimov; the Minister of Economy and Finance, Mr. Radjapov; as well as other senior government officials. 2. The 1998 Article IV consultation was concluded on June 19,1998 (SW98/114 and SM/98/129). On that occasion, Directors noted with concern the recent increase in Turkmenistan’s external debt and stressed that such a strategy was not sustainable in light of the outlook for Turkmenistan’s foreign exchange earnings, given the lower world prices for raw materials (including cotton, gas, and oil), and the likely delays of investments in the energy sector. Directors urged the authorities not to delay adjustment and reform, as this was the only sure way for achieving sustained, non-inflationary growth over the near- and medium-term. 3. Turkmenistan maintains the following exchange restrictions and multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII: (i) the screening by the CBT and the Foreign Exchange Committee of applications for foreign exchange provided through the weekly CBT auction with respect to certain categories of current international transactions conducted by resident legal entities; (ii) the screening by the CBT of applications for foreign exchange cash with respect to medical, educational, and official travel expenses ‘provided directly (not through the auction) to individual Turkmen citizens, (iii) limitations on purchases of foreign exchange resulting from the closure of access to the banking system for current international transactions and for applicants not identified under items (i) and (ii) above; (iv) the requirement that foreign exchange sales to “specialized stores” shall be subject to the condition that commercial mark-ups over the contract price of goods will not exceed 30 percent; and (v) a multiple currency practice arising from the 50 percent foreign exchange tax on gas exports (in effect since December 25, 1997), the proceeds of which are earmarked for the Foreign Exchange Reserves Fund (FERF).3 i Fund relations with Turkmenistan are summarized in Appendix I. Fund technical assistance has focused on policy design and institution building in the fiscal and monetary areas, as well as on the compilation of basic macroeconomic statistics. Relations with the World Bank Group and the EBRD are summarized in Appendices II and III, respectively. Appendix IV includes a matrix on the reporting of main statistical indicators. 2 The staff team comprised Messrs. Pastor (Head), van Rooden, and Dodzin, and Mmes. Khazai and Roehler (all EU2). Mr. Craig, the Fund’s resident representative, assisted the team. Mr. Zurbriigg, Advisor to the Executive Director, attended the second week of discussions. 3 The staff is continuing its examination of the ability of non-residents who receive local currency proceeds from current international transactions to convert such proceeds into foreign exchange and the implications of restrictions on payments related to contracts registered at the State Commodity Exchange prior to September 1, 1998.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS Turkmenistan’s macroeconomic situation is one offragile output growth, accelerating inflation, widening domestic and external imbalances, and mounting debt service problems. Extensive government control over all productive sectors is a visible feature of the economy. 4. Output trends during 1997 and 1998 were heavily influenced by the discontinuation of gas exports to Ukraine, which largely negated the positive contribution to growth by the agricultural (wheat and cotton) and oil sectors (Table 1). Growth in these sectors, as well as in construction, has been financed through domestic and foreign borrowing and some foreign direct investment, particularly in the energy field. For 1999, real GDP is expected to grow by 19 percent largely reflecting a resumption of gas exports to Ukraine, which lasted only through May, when exports were stopped again because of nonpayment by Neftegas Ukraine for 8.7 billion gas cubic meters delivered during that five-month period. Nongas GDP growth is projected at 4 percent in 1999, backed by sustained growth in oil and agriculture. 5. The trend decline in inflation, which started in mid-1996, ended in August 1998 when 12-month inflation was 13.7 percent.4 Inflation subsequently rose steadily to 27 percent in July 1999. Factors explaining the acceleration of inflation include a rapid expansion of central bank credit to banks during the second half of 1998, a widening fiscal deficit financed by central bank credit, and intensified pressures on the exchange rate following the Russia crisis, which tieled price increases of imported goods (Figures 1 and 2).’ 6. On the fiscal side, a combination of weak tax revenue growth and an expansionary government expenditure policy resulted in an overall state budget deficit equivalent to 3 percent of GDP in 1998 (Table 2). Tax revenue, notably from value added tax (VAT), excise duties, and the natural resources tax, remained low throughout the year due to the continued suspension of gas exports to Ukraine. Tax offsets reached 50 percent of budget revenues in 1998 (see SM/99/259). While government spending on goods and services and investment outlays was cut in response to the weak tax revenue performance, this was outweighed by a sharp increase in the wage bill and government transfers, as civil service wages, pensions, and other benefits/compensations to individuals doubled in March 1998. The main source of budgetary financing in 1998 was central bank credit, which was supplied at a zero interest rate.6 Government wage arrears apparently accumulated throughout the year, but were largely eliminated during the last quarter of 1998. 4 Problems with interpreting official inflation data are discussed in SM/99/259. 5 Utilities prices (for water, gas, electricity, and heat) and household service prices (for public transportation, communication, health and education) remained unchanged as these goods and services are supplied at fixed subsidized prices by the government. 6 Since late 1997, no new treasury bills have been issued by the government while the outstanding bills, together with the accrued interest, have been placed in frozen bank accounts and are expected to be repaid gradually over a few years.

During the first three months of 1999, the financial position of the state budget deteriorated further as payments were not received from gas exports to Ukraine. Through end- May 1999, there was an overall tax revenue shortfall of about 30 percent with respect to budgeted levels, while tax arrears (mainly owed by the gas sector) increased sharply to about manat 1.7 trillion (equivalent to 9 percent of GDP). Most of the shortfall was concentrated in indirect taxes (VAT, the natural resources tax, and excise duties), while collections from social security and other direct taxes were more in line with budgetary targets for that period. 8. The authorities’ response to the revenue shortfall has been to further curtail unprotected state budget expenditure-including mainly nonwage expenditure on health and education, and outlays on defense and security- in order to contain the deficit within limits. In addition, the authorities have introduced a number of marginal taxes and extended tax breaks, which in their view would boost output in the agricultural and industrial sector and increase tax collections. Furthermore, the Ministry of Econom reorganized with a view to strengthening expenditure control, 7 and Finance (MOEF) was and a ministerial order was issued narrowing the scope of tax offsets and netting operations. With these measures, the authorities expect to reduce the overall tax revenue shortfall to 10-l 5 percent in the latter part of the year and to be able to finance another doubling of public sector wages and other transfers to individuals budgeted for December 1999. 9. The deterioration of the financial position of the state budget has increasingly pushed government transactions outside the budset to state funds financed by external borrowing and appropriation of export proceeds. Spending by these extrabudgetary funds has included large prestige investment and construction projects, which in the case of the FERF might have been equivalent to 2-4 percent of 1998 GDP. Staff estimates indicate that the consolidated financial position of the state budget and the main extrabudgetary state funds resulted in a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of around 10 percent of GDP in 1998 (Table 3). Adding other quasi-fiscal operations such as implicit interest subsidies on directed bank credits to agriculture and consumer price subsidies supplied by state enterprises yields a PSBR of nearly 14 percent of GDP in 1998. 10. Monetary and credit aggregates grew sharply in 1998, reflecting expansionary central bank financing of the budget deficit and a sharp growth of CBT directed credit to banks for onlending to the agricultural sector (Tables 4 and 5). During the first quarter of ’ Expenditure by line ministries now needs approval of the budget department of the MOEF, which takes into account the overall budgetary situation. Before, the ministries could obtain approval for expenditures from the treasury department as long as they were within their own spending limits. 8 The funds are the State Fund for Oil and Gas, the Agricultural Development Fund, the Transport and Communication Fund, the Health Fund, and the FERF. In practice, the disbursements of new external loans are administered by the individual public entities operating the investment projects concerned and are not formally registered in the accounts of the state funds; debt servicing of these loans, however, is registered in the accounts of the funds. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- 1999, monetary expansion continued at a rapid pace against the background of a deteriorating budgetary position. Thereafter, however, monetary aggregates declined as the CBT stepped up efforts to improve the repayment of loans, while little or no new directed credit was extended. CBT intervention in the foreign exchange market also increased, although this has been limited by the size of the reserves available to the CBT.9 The rapid increase in monetary aggregates in 1998 led to a 35 percent reduction in (end-year) velocity of money (M2), while the money multiplier declined by 20 percent, as the currency/deposit ratio doubled, largely reflecting lack of confidence in the banking system.” 11. In December 1998, a number of measures were introduced to increase control over the activities of the state banks (see SM/99/259). The measures largely formalized the segmentation already existing and reinforced the close links between specific state sectors and state-owned banks, thus discouraging competition, and recreating a Soviet-type banking system with soft budget constraints for state enterprises, lack of financial discipline, and risk of deteriorating bank loan portfolios. 12. After the official and the commercial bank exchange rate were unified in April 1998, this rate and the curb rate stayed very close together, at manat 5,200-5,400 per U.S. dollar. However, the spread widened sharply following the Russian financial crisis, fireled by the rapid monetary expansion in the second half of 1998. As the central bank could no longer keep the commercial bank exchange rate around the level of the official exchange rate of manat 5,200 per U.S. dollar, the commercial bank foreign exchange window was closed in December 1998. This pushed numerous foreign exchange transactions out of the banking system (including a large share of shuttle traders) into the illegal parallel market, triggering a further depreciation of the exchange rate in this market. Following the credit tightening and the increased CBT intervention, the curb market rate leveled off to manat 14,500 per U.S. dollar in June, after having peaked at manat 19,000 per U.S. dollar in April 1999. 13. Offtcial estimates indicate that the current account deficit of the balance of payments almost doubled between 1997 and 1998, reaching 36 percent of GDP (Table 6). This reflected a further deterioration in both trade and services balances, as world prices for energy exports fell, gas exports to Ukraine did not recover, and construction service imports continued to increase. Imports of consumer goods also increased in 1998 with respect to 1997, notably in the first half of the year. Gross international reserves continued to increase, though, as the deterioration of the current account deficit was financed by further increases in public sector medium- and long-term debt to bilateral creditors (i.e., drawings on existing energy-related projects) backed by government guarantees granted to state-owned enterprises, trade credits connected with the execution of large investment and construction projects, and principal repayments (mainly by Ukraine) of rescheduled debt on account of gas deliveries to BR0 countries in the early 1990s. 9 The bulk of the country’s reserves are held by the FERF, under direct control of the President. lo Pitfalls in the compilation of quarterly and annual GDP figures preclude a thorough analysis of trends in velocity of money in Turkmenistan.

In 1998, Turkmenistan’s debt service obligations reached US%600 million, roughly the same level of the country’s total exports. About half of these obligations were rolled-over into 1999, but some US$90-95 million were in arrears by end-1998.” During the first half of 1999, these arrears were reduced in half as some of them were either rescheduled or paid ofE l2 At the same time, debt service obligations falling due were met through new foreign borrowing (against the upcoming cotton crop) and through a severe compression of consumer imports, which fell by 35 percent between the first half of 1998 and the first half of 1999. 15. The Turkmen authorities have made renewed efforts towards settling Turkmenistan’s claims on other BR0 countries.13 In particular, regarding claims on Georgia-on account of outstanding principal payment arrears under the 1996 debt rescheduling agreement-the authorities have written to the Fund stating their readiness to enter into a renewed effort to find a mutually acceptable solution to this problem. However, this process has not yet started. 16. Turkmenistan’s foreign trade regime remained closed and restrictive in 1998. Formally, Turkmenistan has no import duties. However, excise taxes ranging from 10 percent to 100 percent, are levied on a variety of imported goods. Also, almost all imports, as well as all exports, must be authorized by the State Commodities Exchange (Comex), which effectively controls all trade flows and prices. CBT regulations limit the availability of foreign exchange, which can be obtained only through the central bank auction. These regulations also limit profit margins on imported goods paid for with foreign exchange obtained in the auction. 17. Progress with structural reform has remained rather limited. The government’s monopsonistic procurement policy for cotton and wheat remained in place, with procurement prices significantly below world market prices and without discrimination over the quality of the produce bought by the state cotton company, Turkmenpahta, and the State Bread Corporation. Moreover, the procurement process has remained nontransparent, as producers are also provided with inputs at formally subsidized prices. Progress with state enterprise privatization was also held back due to high reservation prices and the government’s reluctance to increase the list of eligible enterprises to include those operating in “strategic sectors” of the economy, including gas, oil, cotton processing, and the aviation industry. The turnover of those firms which were privatized through end-1998 (mainly in the retail trade and services sectors) remained insignificant for the economy as a whole. Finally, private ownership of land, although permitted by the constitution, remains meaningless, as most land is still under the control of state farmer associations, notwithstanding a recent increase in 2-15 year land leases. Those few plots that l1 Including overdue payments on imports of goods and services, external arrears increased by about US$125 million in 1998. l2 Turkmenistan rescheduled about US$50 million in debt service obligations due to Turkey in 1998-99, to be repaid over a period of 6 years, starting 2000. l3 At end-June 1999 Georgia’s debt service arrears to Turkmenistan amounted to roughly US$ 100 million.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS Policy discussions centered around three main themes: (i) the authorities’ response to the external shocks that have hit the economy; (ii) the sustainability of the domestic and external imbalances; and (iii) the status of structural reforms. In general, an effort was made to highlight those areas in which a more resolute effort by the authorities couldyield a significant contribution towards stabilization and growth. A. Policy Response to the External Shocks 18. It was clear from the discussions that the authorities’ main policy concern was how to respond to the external shock stemming from the renewed suspension of gas exports to Ukraine in May 1999, which added to the impact of the drop in world oil and cotton prices in late 1998 and the financial turbulence stemming from the Russian crisis in August 1998. In the authorities’ view, the Turkmen government was moving in a gradual, yet consistent, manner to alleviate the resulting domestic and external imbalances facing the economy. Control over the emission of direct central bank credit to the economy had been tightened up in recent months and no expansion of such central credit to banks had taken place in May and June 1999. Central bank financing of the cotton harvest was likely to be limited this year because Turkmenpahta would sell cotton fiber in advance. Regarding monetary instruments, the authorities were planning to establish deposit auctions (which were inaugurated on July 1, 1999) to mop up liquidity and gradually move to substitute credit auction allocations at market-determined rates for directed credit. Finally, to foster a reversal of the recent increase in the currency/deposit ratio, the authorities planned to eliminate all reserve requirements on bank deposits of households, while at the same time tripling reserve requirements on bank deposits from enterprises. 19. The authorities stressed that, while trade relations with Russia were limited, the Russian crisis had had a deep “psychological” impact on the Turkmen economy, which threatened to undermine the public’s confidence in the national currency and the financial system in general. This had forced the government to tighten exchange restrictions and controls over the operations of major banks to reassure depositors that their bank accounts were safe. The authorities emphasized that these measures were only temporary and would be reversed when economic conditions improved. 20. Regarding the exchange rate, the authorities conceded that the level of the official rate (i.e., manat 5,200 per U.S. dollar) was not realistic, but argued that conditions were not yet conducive to reunifying the foreign exchange market and reopening the commercial bank foreign exchange window. In their view, at the current time, the CBT had limited ability (i.e., access to international reserves) to defend any exchange rate level and therefore it was better to wait until the Fall when foreign exchange receipts from cotton exports would be forthcoming to the central bank. In addition, exchange rate pressures might ease fbrther over the coming months, as fears of undersupply and shortages of basic staples-which arose in the context of the Russian crisis-diminished. The authorities agreed that unification of the foreign exchange market could Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-ll- be sought (after the reopening of the commercial bank window) only at a more depreciated level than manat 5,200 per U.S. dollar, given the underlying pressures in the foreign exchange market and the likelihood that payment problems in export markets would continue. However, they argued that the inflation differential between Turkmenistan and the rest of the world did not validate a unified exchange rate of about manat 14,000 per U.S. dollar (the prevailing rate in the parallel exchange market). 21. The staff expressed the view that the authorities’ policy response to the external shocks facing the economy had been inadequate. Rather than allowing the exchange rate to depreciate in real terms to foster a reduction in domestic absorption, the authorities had intensified trade and exchange restrictions. In addition, controls over prices and quantities bought and sold across domestic producers, and between domestic and foreign firms, had been increased. On theflscalfrant, the policy response so far had been piecemeal as it had included the simultaneous introduction of marginal taxes (in terms of potential revenue gains) and some partial efforts to reduce tax offsets, without tackling the issue of large wage increases (granted last December and promised again for later this year) and the numerous tax exemptions granted through presidential decrees. Moreover, the expansionary policies of the state funds had remained untouched, and if anything had become looser thus aggravating further the imbalances in the external accounts. 22. The staff advised the authorities to tighten the stance of fiscal policy, putting emphasis on expenditure restraint. The staffurged the authorities to adopt a policy of adjusting wages in line with targeted inflation and productivity developments in the economy, rationalize government operations (e.g., moving commercial activities away from ministries’ control), phase out across-the-board price subsidies, and improve the management of public investment. In particular, the staff stressed the need to cut both unproductive spending by the FERF and subsidies supplied by other state funds. Also, the MOEF should increase controls over the state funds with a view to their early elimination. 23. On taxes, the staff advised the authorities to dismantle the current system of punitive taxation on energy and cotton, and bring the tax system more in line with international practices (Table 7 and Box 1). In the staffs view, these economic sectors were heavily taxed by international standards14 and this acted to reduce the sectors’ ability to meet their current and capital expenditure needs (including the servicing of their external debt), hence eroding the future tax base in these sectors. Dismantling such a system and aligning the tax system in line with international practices- mainly through elimination of tax exemptions granted to specific enterprises and entire sectors-could offer the state budget new sources of additional revenue equivalent to more than 4 percent of GDP, ofwhich one percent of GDP would result from the removal of the current system of appropriations of export revenue proceeds levied on the energy and cotton sectors by the state funds (Table 8). l4 The data in Table 7 show that the effective tax rate on oil is equivalent to about 40 percent of total sales proceeds. The effective tax rates on gas and ginned cotton are 55 percent of total sales proceeds. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-12- Box 1.

As regards tax ofiets, the staffs advice was that, despite the difficult current budgetary situation, partial solutions to this endemic problem affecting the budget were not enough. The staff recommended that the government make a clear and unequivocal public commitment to abandon the use of tax offsets once the current round of offsets is completed (December 3 1, 1999). Otherwise, expectations would remain for a new cycle of offsets. 25. The staff welcomed the authorities’ recent efforts to curb directed credits and develop central bank monetary instruments. However, there was a need to contain central bank financing of the wheat harvest over the coming months, which would add to the existing disequilibrium in the goods market and spill over into excess demand for foreign exchange resources. Also, the staff was concerned that the interest rate in the recently established deposit auctions had not been a market-determined rate, but rather a fixed, pre-announced, nominal rate of 5 percent per annum (i.e., negative in real terms). The staff also noted that the commercial banks’ reserve requirement differentiation introduced by the authorities could result in tirther misallocation of bank resources, without enhancing the stability of the money demand. The staff urged the authorities to implement the advice from the Fund’s MAE department regarding the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - development of central bank indirect monetary instruments, especially on interest rate determination, maturity structures, and access rules for the credit and deposit auctions. 26. On exchange rate policy, the staff stressed that, in light of the pervasive distortions stemming from ad hoc trade and exchange controls, the foreign exchange market should be liberalized without delay, and supporting tight credit and fiscal policies implemented to avoid an overshooting of the exchange rate. The commercial bank foreign exchange market must be reopened in order to attract transactions that are currently conducted in the curb market. The staff recommended that, following the liberalization of the exchange market, the exchange rate would be allowed to float with CBT interventions limited to smoothing out sharp fluctuations.” On institutional reform, the staff emphasized that the CBT should acquire full control over the foreign exchange reserves, and that auction market needed to be modified in line with MAE recommendations to make it more transparent and to improve the market-determination of the auction exchange rate. L B. Sustainability of Domestic and External Imbalances 27. Another main problem facing the authorities since 1998 has been how to service the growing public and publicly-guaranteed external debt so as to avoid delays with the construction of the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline (TCP), which, together with the Turkmenbashi oil refinery, is expected to become a main source of foreign exchange in the coming years. The authorities’ hope is to be able to bridge the difficult period through 2003 (when the TCP is expected to become operative) by utilizing foreign disbursements for ongoing projects and new loans against future oil and gas production, but apparently no rigorous quantitative analysis of the feasibility of this approach has been developed by the authorities. 28. The staff assessed the magnitude of the domestic imbalances. Staff’s estimates suggest that, under current policies, the PSBR could reach about 12 percent of GDP in 1999, of which 9 percentage points represent the deficit of the extrabudgetary state funds and the remainder the deficit of the state budget (which itself would be almost twice the original budget target for 1999). In 2000, under current policies, the PSBR could increase even further, reflecting the full-year effect of the public sector wage increase planned for December 1999. The mirror effect of the large PSBR would be an external current account deficit which could reach about US$SOO million in 2000 (twice its 1999 level) and peak at an average of about US$l billion in 2001-2002, before improving over the medium-term (Table 9 and Appendix V). 29. The staff expressed the view that the balance of payments deficits projected for the next 3-4 years might not be sustainable, especially given the possibility of changes in market sentiment and possible delays in the completion of the TCP. In particular, the staff pointed to the l5 In line with previous advice, the staff recommended an initial depreciation of the exchange rate to say manat 10,000 per U.S. dollar, prior to letting the exchange rate float. This two-stage approach to exchange rate liberalization would provide the authorities with the necessary time for implementing macroeconomic measures to support a float and it would also signal the authorities’ new policy direction.

Moreover, given that a significant portion of the reserves may continue to be used as collateral for outstanding loans, l6 there was a likelihood of a cumulative financing gap of some US$400 million developing during 2002-2004. While the authorities could pre-sell future gas exports to close this gap, the staff strongly advised them against such a policy as it would only provide temporary and very costly financial relief at the expense of mortgaging Turkmenistan’s future. In the staffs view, the only certain way of tackling the economy’s potential cash-flow problems is to contain the growth of the external debt-by setting strict limits on public external borrowing and ceasing new state guarantees on state-enterprises’ foreign borrowing-and to foster a more rapid transition to a market economy-including bold moves in structural reform-to bring about a shift from external government borrowing to foreign direct investment. 30. The authorities agreed with the staWs assessment on the magnitude and implications of macroeconomic imbalances in the short- and long-term. The authorities conceded that the 1999 state budget deficit target of manat 201 billion (equivalent to 1 percent of GDP) might be difficult to achieve, but that they would attempt not to exceed the deficit target by exploring all revenue sources. They were most distressed that the revenue situation had deteriorated to the point where even basic needs could not be met. Expenditure within the state budget could not be cut further and, if anything, should be increased in key areas such as education and health. High expectations were being placed on the introduction of a Tax Code (under discussion since 1993) scheduled for later in the year, which, according to the authorities, would incorporate Fund advice, stop attempts to micro-manage the economy through tax exemptions, and require that any new tax exemptions be approved only by parliament and not through presidential decrees. The authorities also acknowledged that there was a need for a better system of managing the extrabudgetary state funds and self financing ministries. In addition, the authorities were planning to limit the contracting and guaranteeing of public sector external debt (while possibly increasing project-finance type borrowing, which does not require state guarantees and may include foreign equity participation) and to centralize decision making in this area. 31. The staff welcomed the authorities’ recent initiatives towards settling Turkmenistan’s claims on Georgia, underscoring that a successful completion of the negotiations could help alleviate Turkmenistan’s debt service problems. The staff informed the authorities that it is Fund policy that a country should normalize relations with creditors, restructure debt in arrears taking into account the debtor country’s capacity to repay, and not permit the accumulation of new arrears with the exception of debt under negotiation. Normally, the Fund does not intermediate in debt restructuring discussions, but could be of assistance, if requested by the parties involved. l6 By end-June 1999, about a third of the country’s gross international reserves was being used as collateral for external commercial borrowing, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- C. Status of Structural Reform 32. Progress with structural reform is likely to remain insignificant in the near future. Key political figures and sectoral policymakers remain opposed to a faster transition to a market economy. Particularly in the area of agriculture, these officials favor setting targets for agricultural production and the continuation of the state order system with low procurement prices. 33. On state enterprise privatization, the authorities noted that transferring medium- and large-scale enterprises to the private sector required first a survey of all state property. According to officials from the Department of State Property and Privatization (DSPP) at the Ministry of Economic and Finance, such a survey would seek to collect information on the physical condition of the state enterprises, their legal status, and the enterprises’ organizational structure and financial position. While the local authorities are supposed to report to the DSPP on their survey efforts by September 1, 1999, implementation of the survey’ s recommendations has been only vaguely defined for some time in 2000. The recent departure of USAID resident advisors on privatization due to lack of progress reduces the likelihood that a serious and well-prepared privatization effort would take place in the near future. 34. Regarding land privatization, it is worrisome that the granting of long-term leases (15 years) to farmers appears to have been done on an ad hoc basis with heavy reliance on whether farmers met the state order targets during a trial period of two years and/or whether local committees considered an individual farmer to be working the land to its potential. The development of a market for land is not imminent as only very limited parcels have been truly transferred into private hands and the law forbids the sale of land. 35. The staff expressed concern about the back tracking in the area of banking sector reform (see paragraph 11, above). The staff argued that a firm step towards strengthening the health of the banking sector would be to reduce the government’s influence over banks’ lending activities. The recently established requirement that all bank loans to state enterprises be approved by the CBT Credit Committee should be abolished without delay. Instead, the CBT should further improve its on- and off-site banking supervision activities, in line with technical assistance recommendations from the Fund. The staff noted that the official estimate of bad loans in banks’ portfolios, equalling 2 percent (about 1.5 percent of GDP), was likely to understate the severity of this problem. Indeed, a large percentage of the outstanding domestic commercial loans to the energy and the agricultural sectors, many of which are dollar- denominated, are continuously rolled-over rather than repaid to the banks. l7 Finally, the staff noted the potential quasi-fiscal costs associated with cleaning up bank portfolios. 36. The authorities were less troubled than the staff about the economic implications of the increased government control over banks. They noted that the recent increased controls over state-owned banks had been introduced in response to the Russian crisis that threatened to l7 Total loans outstanding to the state enterprise sector amounted to over 70 percent of GDP by end-1998, the bulk of which consisted of external borrowing by the government for onlending through the banking system.

The measures aimed at engineering a defacto deposit insurance to assure depositors that the government was in control of the situation and that the banking system would not be shaken up by the Russian fallout. These initiatives had been complemented by actions to establish temporary bank supervision bodies in each of the state banks that would monitor the banks’ lending portfolio and capital adequacy, and report to the CBT on a monthly basis. The authorities noted that the requirement that all bank loans to state enterprises be cleared by the CBT reflected the government’s concern about adverse selection in the granting of bank loans to enterprises in weak financial condition. D. Other Issues 37. Turkmenistan’s macroeconomic statistics continue to suffer from a number of weaknesses. Notably, there are source, coverage, and valuation problems with the compilation of national accounts data. Budgetary data display similar shortcomings and are still not available on the basis of an economic classification and there is no comprehensive information on extrabudgetary (i.e., state funds) operations. Balance of payments statistics, although considerably improved with Fund technical assistance, do not fully conform to international standards. By contrast, compilation of monetary data has improved vastly in recent years, although work is still needed to develop a new plan of accounts (for both the central bank and the rest of the banking system) in line with International Accounting Standards. The staff considers Turkmenistan’s basic macroeconomic statistics to be broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, notwithstanding the referred to data collection problems. The authorities reassured the staff about their commitment to continue to address these data collection problems. The authorities currently publish a growing range of economic indicators and report core economic indicators to the Fund on a regular basis (Appendix IV). 38. The staff discussed with the authorities their readiness to handle the Y2K problem. According to government officials, computer hardware used by government institutions and other key state-owned enterprises is either too new or marginal (in terms of its role/impact on the production cycle) to be significantly affected by the millennium computer problem. In the case of state banks, ad hoc technical assistance supplied by foreign correspondent banks had also minimized the chance of Y2K related problems. Iv. STAFF h’PRAISAL 39. During the last two years the Turkmen economy has been adversely affected by a number of external shocks which have added to the authorities’ challenge to manage an economy still operating under a system of state orders and procurement prices, and lacking a dynamic private sector. On the one hand, a lack of market reforms and the large role of state banks and enterprises in the economy has allowed the Turkmen authorities to engineer price and quantity controls which have driven excess demand pressures underground. On the other hand, heavy government intervention in the economy has perpetuated past practices such as barter arrangements and has been a deterrent to private foreign direct investment which could have helped finance the large investment needs of this resource-rich economy. Instead, the authorities’ strategy over the past few years has been to engage in substantial foreign borrowing from Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- industrialized and middle income western countries/parties-backed by large energy exports expected over the medium-term and guaranteed by the Turkmen state and the export-import agencies of these countries-to finance the development and upgrading of the agriculture, energy and textiles sectors. 40. While the authorities may continue to hold on through these difficult years, their strategy, however, is not sustainable. For one, the completion of the TCP by 2003, as envisioned by the authorities, is not yet assured. Also, the system of controls can only temporarily dampen pressures towards inflation and exchange rate depreciation in the presence of expansionary financial policies. Finally, lack of accountability by institutions engaged in foreign borrowing and their inability to generate incentives and/or domestic savings has left the central administration with a deteriorating infrastructure and growing debt service obligations which are being met out of a limited pool of foreign exchange resources coming from oil and cotton exports. 41. Although the authorities may be able to manage the debt service problem and temporarily suppress price and output imbalances in the near term through more controls and appropriations of domestic and foreign exchange resources of state enterprises, the staffs discussions pointed to the conclusion that time is running out. 42. In the staff’s view, a fundamental reform of the economy and the public institutions is required. For the immediate future, the appropriate policy response to the renewed suspension of gas exports to Ukraine should be to let the exchange rate depreciate in real terms, while reunifying the exchange rate market, and to engineer a fiscal withdrawal-rather than intensify exchange and trade restrictions-to reduce domestic absorption. Elements of this fiscal withdrawal in the short-term lie mainly in the area of expenditure restraint, including a careful re-examination of the current government wage policy, putting a stop to unproductive investment projects carried on by the extrabudgetary state funds, and streamlining public spending priorities, in general. However, action must also be put in train to begin tapping additional resources (i.e., the taxable revenue forgone) which would allow the government to service the public and publicly-guaranteed external debt on a timely basis for the years to come and to hedge the country from any sudden change in market sentiment about Turkmenistan’s creditworthiness. 43. In the staffs view, steps must also be taken for a more rapid and sustainable transition towards a market economy over the next couple of years. This would entail further fiscal consolidation and the development of basic monetary policy market instruments. It would also require implementation of structural measures-particularly with regard to legal and governance reforms-needed to attract additional private foreign investment and reduce the present reliance on publicly funded development, These measures may be enhanced by placing limits on the contracting of new public external debt in order to avoid running into the balance of payments financing gap projected by the staff between the years 2002-2004. 44. The authorities are aware that the domestic and external imbalances are very large and demand difficult policy decisions to solve them. Their view, however, is to proceed gradually and use tax and other instruments to micro-manage the economy and promote economic sectors which, in the authorities’ view, make important contributions to the economy. The staffs view is Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- that the authorities’ approach is fraught with fundamental difficulties, not only because it is at odds with the established view that clear policy rules and a level playing field for all economic agencies is the best recipe for sustainable growth, but also because the authorities’ gradual and, at times, piecemeal, approach to reform does not provide a clear signal to investors and other economic agents that the rules of the game have indeed changed and budget constraints will be binding. 45. Lack of structural reform is a severe impediment for high quality growth. In addition, its absence is hindering the development of basic entrepreneurial talents, particularly in the agricultural sector in which about half of the population works. While the authorities argue that heavy government intervention in all areas of production and financial intermediation is necessary due to the early stage of development of the private sector and its inability to fully bear the risks of a market economy, this approach could prolong an economic system which has proven to be non-viable by historical standards. 46. Turkmenistan’s renewed approach toward the settling of debt claims with Georgia is a welcome development and will hopefully lead to a mutually acceptable solution for both debtor and creditor in the near future. 47. Turkmenistan maintains restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII and a multiple currency practice, as described in paragraph 3 above. In the absence of a clear timetable for elimination of these arrangements, the staff does not recommend their approval and would urge their removal. 48. While efforts to improve the compilation of basic economic statistics are recognized, deficiencies remain regarding the availability, quality, and timeliness of fiscal and balance of payments data. Notwithstanding these weaknesses, the stti considers the macroeconomic data available to be broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. 49. It is proposed that the next consultation take place on the standard 1Zmonth cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicTable 1.

Exchange rate arrangements: The currency of Turkmenistan, the manat, was introduced on November 1, 1993 at the official exchange rate of manat 2 per U.S. dollar. Since May 1996, the official rate is determined in weekly foreign exchange auctions, which are, however, controlled by the CBT. The official rate, which gradually depreciated earlier, was held constant at manat 4,165 per U.S. dollar after May 1997, about 25 percent below the average exchange rate of commercial banks. On April 17, 1998, the official exchange rate was depreciated to manat 5,200 per U.S. dollar and unified with the commercial banks’ exchange rate. On December 3, 1998, the commercial bank market was closed, leaving the heavily controlled foreign exchange auctions as the only official market for foreign exchange.

Turkmenistan signed the Articles of Agreement of the World Bank Group on September 22, 1992. It became member of MIGA in October 1993 and of the IFC in mid-1997. The Bank finalized the first Country Economic Memorandum in May 1994. The Bank also prepared an Energy Sector Review (FY94), a Health Sector Review (FY95), an Agrarian Sector Review (FY96), special needs assessments in rural water supply and sanitation and urban transport (FY97), a regional development study for the poorest region of the country @askhovuz)(FY98) and a report on Improving the Management of Public Expenditures (FY99). An Energy Exports Prospects Study is underway. The Bank has also provided substantive assistance and advice on privatization issues. 2. An Institution Building/Technical Assistance Loan @TA) in the amount of US$25 million was approved on September 15, 1994 and became effective in July 1995. This loan is addressing selected areas of institutional reform to support the financial sector, energy sector, and the social safety net. The loan includes support for introducing broad based legal and regulatory reforms, finances training in accounting, auditing, and project analysis. An Urban Transport Project (US$34 million) and a Water Supply and Sanitation project (US$30 million) were approved by the Board on May 27, 1997. These projects serve as instruments to support institutional and pricing reform in the transport and water supply sectors, respectively. They are designed to improve the provision of transport and other basic infrastructure services in key urban centers and Turkmenistan’s poorest regions. The Bank has also approved two Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grants for Public Procurement Reform (US$160,000, signed in September 1996) and External Debt Management (IJS$324,000, signed in August 1998). The first Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Turkmenistan was presented to the Board on May 27, 1997. A fact-finding mission from the World Bank visited Ashgabat in June 1999 to collect data for updating the CAS later in the year. Work has also been initiated for a Pilot Health Project, based on the Health Sector Review and a Crop Protection and Animal Health Project, based on the Agrarian Sector Review. In 1996, the Bank established a Liaison Office in Ashgabat to enhance communications with the government and to provide operational support. 3. Following a review by the World Bank of Bank-financed projects in Turkmenistan, it was determined that there was non-compliance with some covenants under the Loan Agreements, particularly in relation to prescribed procurement procedures, leading to the suspension of loan disbursement under all three ongoing projects effective March 30, 1998. Following reestablishment of compliance, the suspension on the Urban Transport and Water Supply and Sanitation Projects was lifted on June 1, 1999. The suspension on the IBTA Loan was lifted on August 6,1999. ‘Information provided by World Bank staff.

Turkmenistan joined the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 1992. The EBRD is pursuing a strategy of supporting Turkmenistan’s transformation toward a market economy and the promotion of the business environment through: (i) the development of enterprise activity through credit lines and direct equity funding for small and medium-sized enterprises; (ii) the strengthening of the financial sector; and (iii) improvements in infrastructure. 2. The EBRD’s portfolio in Turkmenistan currently consists of 4 projects, accounting for a total commitment of Euro 137 million. Projects include an equity participation in a textile joint venture (Euro 28 million); the modernization of the main road from Ashgabat to Mary (Euro 47 million); the upgrading of infrastructure in Caspian Sea port of Turkmenbashi (Euro 28 million); and a credit program for small and medium sized enterprises (Euro 33 million). However, disbursements have remained limited to the participation in the textile factory and about Euro 4.5 million under the small and medium-size enterprises project.

GDP estimates are produced by the National Institute for Statistics and Forecasting (TSP). In mid-1998, TSP and the Institute for Economic Research were merged and subsequently TSP was reorganized and strengthened in terms of the number and quality of its staff. However, the computing capacity of TSP remains inadequate. The national accounts missions from STA during 1998 and April 1999 have assisted in bringing about significant improvements in national accounts statistics. The coverage of GDP estimates has improved, imputations are made for non-response of de novo private sector enterprises and adjustments are now made to cover informal sector activities. However, serveral deficiencies remain due to weaknesses in the basic source data, inadequate coverage of the government sector, incorrect estimation of holding gains and of the changes in inventories. Estimates of GDP in constant prices are compiled using a single indicator method at aggregate level only, while GDP estimates by expenditure are only compiled in current prices and have several defects, including improper valuation of external trade transactions in local currency because of the use of the over-valued official exchange rate for conversion purposes. In the present situation with multiple exchange rates the authorities are far from being able to accurately compute the external trade transactions in local currency. 2. A work program for the further improvement of national accounts addressing these issues was discussed and agreed with the authorities during the latest STA mission. Price indices 3. Consumer price inflation is measured by a chain-linked Laspeyres-type index, with various subindices available. Compilation methods of producer price statistics are not adequately defined, casting doubts on the accuracy of the producer price index. The Turkmen authorities have recently started to compile unit value indices of imports and exports. Government finance 4. The offtcial budget continues to show expenditures by function and not on the basis of an economic classification. The budget includes data on the activities of the general government, the State Funds, and the self-financed ministries. Only the activities of the general government are the control of the treasury system and are subject to approval by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The 1999 budget includes (for the first time ever) subsidy estimates for the provision of flour and free gas, electricity, water, and salt. Also, for the first time, data on debt service on account of loans with government guarantees are shown in the 1999 budget. Monetary accounts 5. Compilation of monetary accounts is based on a system originally developed with STA technical assistance. More recently, however, the system has been updated by EU2 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 35 - APPENDIX IV missions to reflect ongoing changes in the banks’ chart of accounts. Availability and reliability of the monetary data have been enhanced with the introduction of a new interim charts of accounts for the CBT and commercial banks in line with International Accounting Standards (IAS) in March 1998. The CBT intends to implement a full new chart of accounts in 1999/2000. Further technical assistance from the Fund to address shortcomings in money and banking statistics and national accounts is planned during FY2000. Balance of payments 6. Turkmenistan’s balance of payments statistics are produced on a quarterly basis by the CBT according to the methodology of the frfih edition of the IMF Balance of Payments Manual. Significant Fund technical assistance has been extended to Turkmenistan. The most recent STA mission visited Ashgabat from October 29- November 11, 1998. 7. Balance of payments compilation has made good progress in recent years, even though some deficiencies remain. In particular the compilation of direct investment capital and income, and external debt statistics were improved. External debt management and statistics should improve further once the technical assistance program financed by the World Bank’s (through the International Development Fund) starts later in the year. 8. International trade statistics suffer from coverage and valuation problems of customs data. Better data collection and processing is necessary which requires a strengthening of the State Customs of Turkmenistan (SCT) and of the Foreign Economic Relations Department at the National Institute for Statistics and Forecasting with both personnel and computer equipment. A valuation department at the SCT to verify declared import and export values needs to be established. Also, more extensive data on travel, the freight and insurance of imports, and foreign direct investment and the activities of joint venture companies need to be collected. The activities of foreign construction enterprises-which are significant- are currently classified as construction services rather than as those of resident direct investment enterprises, which is the international practice.

The medium-term scenario discussed with the authorities assumed the completion of two projects that have very high priority for the government: the TCP into Turkey by the year 2003 and the completion of the major parts of the Turkmenbashi oil refinery upgrade project (see SM/99/259). Gas exports through the new gas pipeline are assumed to increase gradually. The projections for the value of oil exports were based on an intermediate increase in crude oil production that would be sufficient to supply the refinery, and took into account transportation costs and likely changes in the product mix. Other key assumptions were: (i) modest gas exports to BR0 countries and to Iran; (ii) conservative growth estimates for cotton exports in light of structural problems in the agricultural sector; (iii) partial receipt of payments due on rescheduled gas debt; (iv) delayed realization of planned government projects which would limit the increase in official debt; and (v) continuous delays in debt service payments resulting in a further accumulation of arrears over the next few years. The latter assumption reflects continued limited CBT control over foreign exchange reserves. The projections showed a steeply deteriorating external position over the next few years with a financing gap for the years 2002 to 2004 and a recovery thereafter. This was in line with the authorities’ expectations that Turkmenistan’s external problems could be solved with the completion of the TCP. Main macroeconomic indicators of the medium-term outlook are attached (Table 1). 2. These projections, however, are subject to a large degree of uncertainty and it may be that the current account remains in deficit beyond 2003. In particular, the completion of the TCP as envisioned is not yet assured, because there are many potential suppliers for the Turkish gas market, to which Azerbaijan-a transit country-has recently been added. Turkmenistan’s external position is moreover heavily influenced by the prices for its three key export goods oil, gas, and cotton that are very volatile. In addition, Turkmenistan’s sizable debt stock requires an increased debt service during the next few years because initial grace periods will expire. Recent debt service arrears- notwithstanding official reserves exceeding US$l.3 billion-could also endanger refinancing and financing for new foreign investment projects. On the positive side, Turkmenistan may be able to increase crude oil production and exports if production sharing arrangements are expanded and access to crude oil pipelines or other export routes can be assured. Energy projections indicate that mutually beneficial arrangements for gas exports through the Gazprom controlled pipeline network (via Russia-Ukraine) could be possible, especially for the later years of the projection horizon. Investments in the textiles industry may start to generate export revenues. Government entities control some key import categories like construction services, which could be reduced. Last, structural reforms in agriculture and privatization would provide incentives to increase production of cotton and of import substitutes for consumer goods.

During the last two years the Turkmen economy has been adversely affected by a number of external shocks which have added to the authorities’ challenge to manage an economy lacking a dynamic private sector. In early 1997, gas export s to Ukraine were suspended because of payments problems, resulting in a sharp decline in real GDP during that year. In 1998, output recovered thanks to strong growth in the agricultural and oil sectors, which was largely financed through external and domestic borrowing. In 1999, gas exports to Ukraine resumed, but came to a halt in May because of renewed payment problems with deliveries. For 1999, real GDP is projected to grow by around 19 percent, largely reflecting the boost to gas production experienced during the first five months of the year. 2. The trend decline in inflation, which started in mid-1996, ended in August 1998, when 1Zmonth inflation was 14 percent. Inflation subsequently rose steadily to 27 percent in July 1999. Factors explaining the acceleration of inflation include a rapid expansion of central bank credit to banks during the second half of 1998, a widening fiscal deficit financed with central bank credit, and intensified pressures on the exchange rate following the Russia crisis, which fueled price increases of imported goods. Utilities prices (for water, gas, electricity, and heat) and household service prices (for public transportation, communication, heath and education) remained unchanged as these goods and services are supplied at fixed subsidized prices by the government. 3. On the fiscal side, a combination of tax revenue growth and expansionary expenditure policy resulted in an overall state budget deficit equivalent to 3 percent of GDP in 1998. The main source of budgetary financing in 1998 was central bank credit, which was supplied at zero interest rate. The deterioration of the financial position of the state budget has increasingly pushed government transactions outside the budget to state funds financed by external borrowing and appropriations of exports proceeds. These funds are the State Fund for Oil and Gas, the Agricultural Development Fund, the Transport and Communication Fund, the Health Fund, and the Foreign Exchange Reserve Fund or FERF. Staff estimates indicate that the consolidated financial position of the state budget and the main extrabudgetary state funds resulted in a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of around 10 percent of GDP in 1998. Adding other quasifiscal operations such as the implicit interest subsidies on directed bank credit to agriculture and consumer price subsidies supplied by state enterprises yields a PSBR of nearly 14 percent of GDP in 1998. For 1999, the equivalent PSBR figure is projected at 16 percent of GDP, of which 3 percentage points reflect the state budget deficit; 9 percentage points, the deficit of the state funds; and the difference the impact of the subsidies provided by the state enterprise sector. 4. Following the unification of the official and commercial bank exchange rate in April 1998, this (unified) rate and the curb rate stayed close together at manat 5,200- 5,400 per U.S. dollar. However, the commercial bank foreign exchange window was closed in December 1998 in the aftermath of the Russian financial crisis and rapid central bank credit growth to finance the budget deficit and domestic banks operating in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - APPENDIX VI agricultural sector. This pushed numerous foreign exchange transactions out of the banking system into the parallel market, triggering a further depreciation of the exchange rate in this market. At end-June 1999, the exchange rate in the parallel market was manat 14,500 per U.S. dollar, about three times the level of the official exchange rate. 5. Offtcial estimates indicate that the current account deficit of the balance of payments rose sharply between 1997 and 1998, reaching 36 percent of GDP. Gross international reserves continued to increase, though, as the deterioration of the current account deficit was financed by further increases in public sector medium- and long-term borrowing, trade credits connected with the execution of large investment and construction projects, and principal repayments of rescheduled debt on account of gas deliveries to BR0 countries in the early 1990s. External debt service arrears reached about US$lOO million by end-1998, although about half of these arrears were eliminated in early 1999 through rescheduling or were paid off.
