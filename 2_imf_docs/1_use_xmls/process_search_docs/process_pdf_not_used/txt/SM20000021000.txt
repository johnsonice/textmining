Both the fiscal and external account deficits narrowed significantly in 1999 and would turn into surpluses in 2000. Although real GDP fell in 1999 due to the OPEC-agreed cut in oil output, non-oil real GDP growth continued to accelerate in both 1999 and 2000. l The authorities stepped up structural reforms to promote growth and employment, economic diversification, and the private sector’s role. In addition to the corporatization of the telecommunications and electricity sectors with a view to their privatization, new laws on investment were issued aimed at encouraging foreign direct investment and establishing a level playing field between foreign corporations and Saudi businesses, and discussions with the international oil companies are underway to open the gas sector to foreign investment. A host of other initiatives to further liberalize the economy are under review (Box 3). l Despite improved oil proceeds since mid- 1999, the authorities maintained a tight fiscal policy stance through expenditure cuts. However, achieving a fiscal balance and reducing significantly the government debt by 2005 would require a steadfast implementation of key structural and fiscal reforms. Staff Appraisal The staff commends the authorities for their success to contain the deterioration in the fiscal and external accounts, defend the exchange rate, and preserve the soundness of the financial system. It calls for increased vigilance to achieve the 2000 budget expenditure targets to ensure a reduction of government debt. The staff welcomes the important steps to improve the business environment and further open the economy to foreign investment. It encourages the authorities to deepen and expedite the implementation of reforms, especially in the areas of privatization, the investment and real estate laws, the labor market (through training, review of the curricula, and issuance of the labor law), and fiscal restructuring (including a review of the tax system, a strengthening of the tax and customs departments, and curbing the growth of the wage bill). The staff welcomes the recent improvement in economic and financial data, but calls for strengthening the statistical data base, especially in the areas of fiscal statistics (including the operations of autonomous government institutions), the national accounts, labor market and wages, and capital movements. It encourages the authorities to participate in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- I. INTRODUCTIONANDBACKGROUND 1. The 2000 Article IV consultation discussions took place against the backdrop of improved economic conditions following the strong recovery in oil prices since mid-1999 and an acceleration of economic reforms. Thus, the discussions focused on the structural reforms underway to open the economy and strengthen growth prospects; the need to set fiscal policy on a sustainable path over the medium term; and the progress toward improving the collection and dissemination of economic and financial information, including further strengthening the reporting to the Fund. 2. The previous Article IV consultation was concluded on October 6,1999 (EBM/99/112). On that occasion, Directors observed that the fiscal and monetary policy actions taken by the authorities since May 1998, together with the recovery in oil prices, had narrowed the fiscal and balance of payments deficits, strengthened private sector confidence, and enhanced the credibility of the authorities’ commitment to the exchange rate peg. Noting the economy’s continued high dependence on the oil sector and the remaining financial imbalances, Directors called on the authorities to consolidate further the fiscal position and to accelerate the structural reforms in order to establish solid foundations for higher and sustained economic growth. They also stressed the need for further improvement in statistics, and were encouraged by the ongoing efforts to enhance the dissemination of economic and financial information to the public. 3. The Saudi economy experienced a major setback in 1998 and early 1999 due to the sharp drop in oil prices and the turbulence in emerging markets. However, the economy proved resilient to the exogenous shock, and the authorities successfully managed to contain the deterioration in the financial balances through revenue enhancing measures and expenditure cuts. Still, the fiscal deficit widened, the external current account moved into a deficit, real GDP growth decelerated, and equity prices dropped. Since early 1999, in cooperation with other major oil producing countries, the authorities have moved to shore up oil prices by managing supply in line with developments in global demand. 4. The 1998 exogenous shock reinforced the momentum of economic reform. In order to meet the overriding challenge of achieving higher growth and boosting the creation of jobs in the private sector for the large number of Saudi entrants in the labor market, the authorities moved swiftly to expedite economic reforms, including promoting the role of the private sector, further opening up the economy to foreign investment, and accelerating the preparatory work to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). This, together with the improvement in the external environment, should allow for higher economic growth and employment, and provide an opportunity to reduce the budget’s vulnerability to fluctuations in oil prices by diversifying the revenue base and containing the growth of public spending.

Overall economic conditions improved in 1999. Following the March 1999 agreement among major oil producers, average oil export prices for the year as a whole rose by 46 percent compared to 1998, leading to a 3 1 percent rise in oil export earnings (Box 1). However, as crude oil production was cut by close to 9 percent for the year as a whole, total real GDP declined by about 1 percent in 1999. Non-oil GDP grew by 1.9 percent in real terms, driven mainly by the sustained growth in manufacturing and services, even though activity in construction and public works weakened. Nevertheless, real gross domestic income rose by 14 percent (Table 1, Charts 1 and 2), due to the positive terms of trade effect.’ Box 1: Oil Market Developments in 1999 and 2000 The OPEC Agreement of March 1999 and its impact on prices . Total OPEC output was to be reduced by 1.72 million of barrels per day or about 7 percent (excluding Iraq), while non-OPEC Mexico, Norway, Oman and Russia also pledged a total cut of 0.39 million barrels per day (3.7 percent). Saudi Arabia’s cut of 7.3 percent brought its official quota to 7.44 million barrels per day. . The high compliance to the agreed quotas, combined with a robust world economic growth, resulted in a price increase of 133 percent, from US$10.75 per barrel in February to US$25.10 per barrel in December 1999.’ The average export price for Saudi oil rose by 42 percent in 1999 compared to 1998. Oil market developments in 2000 . Following the sharp oil price increase of 1999, accompanied by the decline of world inventories to historic low levels, OPEC agreed at its end-March 2000 meeting to revert to the March 1999 quota ceilings. This did not achieve the objective of stabilizing the price. On June 2 1, a further OPEC meeting increased the production ceiling by 0.708 million barrels per day, effective July 1. Major non-OPEC producers-Mexico and Norway- also signaled their intention to increase their production levels. However, the price of the OPEC basket of crude oils continued to be around US$30.00 per barrel, as market consensus was that the quota increase was insufficient. . Taken together, the March and June 2000 quota agreements could not curb the oil price increase: the average ~. WE0 price in June (US$29.62 per barrel) was about 8 percent higher than the average price in March. Current projections indicate that the average Saudi export price would increase by about 46 percent in 2000 compared to 1999. . The medium-term outlook based on current WE0 projections shows the price moving in the US$19.70- US%2 1.10 per barrel between 2001 and 2005. ’ Average of the three WE0 crude oils: Brent, Dubai and West Texas Intermediate (WTI). ’ Real gross domestic income (i.e., real GDP adjusted for the terms of trade effects) provides a better measurement of the purchasing power of gross domestic product in an economy that is subject to large movements in the terms of trade (see Saudi Arabia: Recent Economic Developments and Selected Issues, September 2000).

The central government’s overall fiscal deficit narrowed significantly, reflecting both higher oii revenue and expenditure cuts.2 Oil revenue rose by 30 percent compared to 1998, but non-oil revenue fell below its level in both the previous year and the budget estimates, despite the full-year impact of the new measures that were introduced in 1998 (Table 2 and Chart 3).3 This reflects the fact that some of the efforts to mobilize non-oil revenue in 1998 (such as the collection of penalties and sale of land) were exceptional in nature and could not be sustained. Altogether, total budget revenue declined by almost 2 percentage points of GDP compared to the 1998 outcome. On the expenditure side, the authorities maintained a tight policy stance, which led to a decline in total expenditure by about 5 percentage points of GDP to 34.6 percent. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit declined from the equivalent of 10.2 percent of GDP in 1998 to 6.8 percent in 1999. 7. Further settlements of late payments were made in 1999. The authorities continued to regularize the situation of late payments by settling SRls 30 billion (5.7 percent of GDP) to the General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI), the Saudi Arabian Airline, and various contractors. The settlements and the overall fiscal deficit were financed through government domestic borrowing, which led to an increase in the domestic debt by 1.5 percentage points of GDP to the equivalent of 118 percent of GDP at end-l 999. 8. Reflecting buoyant oil export revenue and lower imports, the trade balance and the external current account position improved considerably. Total exports rose by 25 percent due to higher oil export prices, while non-oil exports continued to suffer from weak international prices for petrochemical products in the aftermath of the Asian crisis (Table 3 and Chart 4). Imports declined by about 7 percent compared to the previous year on account of lower import prices, relatively weak economic activity, and a drawdown of inventories that were built up in 1998. While net service payments remained virtually unchanged, the current account deficit declined from 10.2 percent of GDP in 1998 to 1.2 percent in 1999. However, net capital movements recorded an outflow of US$5.8 billion, possibly reflecting private portfolio adjustments following several years of net inflows. In these circumstances, the overall balance of payments recorded a deficit of US$7.5 billion, which was financed by a drawdown of SAMA’s net foreign assets. 9. Liquidity conditions improved. Broad money stock rose by about 7 percent, owing to the sharp increase in net bank credit to the government, a seasonally high demand for liquidity toward the end of the year in connection with Ramadan, and the precautionary 2 The central government accounts exclude the operations of the Public Investment Fund (PIF), and those of the autonomous government agencies (AGIs), mainly GOSI and the pension fund. For further details on the coverage of the fiscal accounts, see Saudi Arabia: Recent Economic Developments and Selected Issues, September 2000. 3 These include a 50 percent increase in gasoline prices, higher fees on expatriate workers, and the introduction of an airport fee (see W/99/222, September 14, 1999).

In contrast, the growth of credit to the private sector decelerated sharply due to the relatively weak economic activity and the government’s settlement of late payments. The interest rate differential vis-a-vis U.S. denominated assets dropped sharply from the exceptionally high level during the first quarter of 1999 that resulted from the speculative attacks against the Saudi Arabian riyal.4 Meanwhile, despite the increase in domestic gasoline prices, CPI-based inflation declined further due to lower import prices. 10. The performance of the financial sector remained strong. Bank profits increased by 10 percent, and stock market prices recovered by 44 percent from the drop in 1998 (Table 5). The recent trend of acquisitions and mergers continued in 1999. The acquisition by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of 50 percent of the capital of the National Commercial Bank-the largest bank in Saudi Arabia-was a temporary measure aimed at diversifying the bank’s ownership and improving its management in preparation for the divestiture of government equity share throu& the stock market. B. Policy Developments in 1999 and Early 2000 11. With full support from the political leadership, a number of far-reaching structural reform measures were introduced to create a more favorable environment for investment and private sector development. A Supreme Economic Council was established in August 1999 under the chairmanship of Crown Prince Abdallah bin Abdul Aziz. Composed of key economic ministers, the Council is in charge of coordinating and expediting policy formulation and implementation of economic reforms5 Since its establishment, the Council has considered a wide range of legislative and regulatory reforms, some of which were approved by the cabinet {Box 2). A new foreign investment law was approved in April 2000, allowing fully foreign-owned companies to benefit from the investment incentives offered to Saudi businesses, and own their business-related real estate. The law also reduces the corporate income tax rate applicable to foreign companies from a maximum of 45 percent to up to 30 percent. Furthermore, the Saudi Industrial Development Fund will allow foreign investors equal access to its long-term credit facilities. Also, to facilitate investors’ relations with government agencies and streamline administrative procedures, a one-stop shop for investment, the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) was established. Finally, opportunities for foreigners to invest in the Saudi stock exchange through open-end mutual funds have been enhanced. 4 See SM/99/222, September 14, 1999. ’ Mr. Abdul Rahman Al-Tuwaijri, former Executive Director for Saudi Arabia at the IMF, is the Secretary General of the Supreme Economic Council.

These two laws-which went into effect in mid-May 2000- give a range of new incentives to attract foreign investment and Saudi capital invested abroad. They also aim at establishing a level playing field between local and foreign investors, including lowering taxes on foreign firms, and allowing fully foreign-owned companies to benefit from the investment incentives available to local companies. The new investment law-which replaced the one issued in 1979-applies to foreign “direct” investment (i.e., investment in real assets), not “portfolio” investment, and covers all sectors. It also permits foreigners to own land and real estate, and sponsor their expatriate employees. The Saudi Industrial Development Fund has also revised its finance policy to allow the extension of credit to fully foreign-owned industrial projects in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the new foreign investment law will allow foreign companies to: . Carry losses forward with no time limit (as against time-limited tax holidays, which will continue to apply to companies that had acquired them under the previous law). . Pay a profit tax with a maximum rate of 30 percent (after a tax rebate of 15 percent to be borne by the government) on profits above Srls 100,000.’ . Repatriate abroad up to 100 percent of profits or share from the enterprise liquidation. . Invest in all economic activities except for a “negative” list of activities (which would include basically defense industries, upstream oil development, real estate in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and some other activities of low developmental or technical value). SAGIA will act as the implementing vehicle for the new investment law. It will serve as a “one-stop shop” for foreign and local investors (for project approval within 30 days), and will expedite the licensing and the provision of various government services to investors. SAGIA’s board of directors is chaired by Prince Abdullah bin Faysal bin Turki (formerly the Governor of the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu industrial areas) and includes representatives from nine ministries, SAMA, and the private sector. ’ This stipulation was intended to expedite the improvement in the tax treatment of foreign investors pending the issuance of a comprehensive new income tax law. Saudi companies will continue to pay Zakat at 2.5 percent of the value of their assets. No capital gains tax was stipulated in the new investment law. 12. A major development in Saudi Arabia’s reform strategy has been the decision to allow foreign oil companies to invest in the gas sector and oil downstream activities. In early 2000, the authorities invited international oil companies (IOCs) to present investment offers in the gas sector, including downstream activities, such as liquefaction, transportation, power generation, petrochemicals, and water desalination. The investment proposals-which are under consideration by the Supreme Council for Petroleum and Mineral Affairs (SPC j could be finalized by end-2000 for implementation in 2001 and are expected to result in sizable foreign direct investment inflows in the next few years.‘j 6 SPC is responsible for formulating petroleum policy in the Kingdom. Its membership includes key ministers and it is playing a central role in the negotiations to involve IOCs in the gas sector.

Following the corporatization of the telecommunication services through the establishment of the Saudi Telecommunications Company (STC) in 1998, progress was made toward establishing the regulatory framework for the sector, following which a strategic partner could be selected, In the electricity sector, the seven regional suppliers (and affiliated electricity projects) were merged into the Saudi Electric Company (SEC), in which the government holds 85 percent equity share. The restructuring of the SEC was initiated with the objective of developing a regulatory framework for the power sector and selling the government’s shares to the private sector in 2001. Electricity tariffs were increased by an average of 78 percent effective April 2000, thus virtually eliminating the related subsidy. 14. Work on key elements of the tax reform has continued. The revised income tax law and the proposed introduction of indirect taxes are under active consideration. However, while the authorities remain committed to modemizing the customs and tax departments, progress in this area has been slower than expected.’ The framework for such modemization-including computerization, establishment of a tax identification number and a large taxpayer unit-was put in place, but implementation has been hampered by organizational and staffing difficulties. 15. The preparatory work for accession to WTO has intensified. In June 1999, Saudi Arabia presented its third revised offer on trade in goods and services, including an action plan for the implementation of various WTO agreements on trademark, intellectual property rights, import licensing, and sanitary and phytosanitory measures. Agreements were reached with eighteen member countries, of which five were signed.* The authorities have involved private sector representatives in the preparatory work for the WTO accession. C. Prospects for 2000 16. A strong recovery in growth is expected in 2000. Real GDP growth would accelerate to 3.5 percent, reflecting a pick up in non-oil activity and higher crude oil output under the recent OPEC agreements. Taking into account the positive terms of trade effect, real gross domestic income is expected to increase by about 20 percent, while inflation will remain very low. ’ Efforts in this area are being supported by FAD technical assistance. * These are Australia, Canada, Japan, Pakistan, and Uruguay.

Based on a conservative oil price assumption (US$l8 per barrel), the 2000 budget maintains the relatively tight expenditure stance of the past two years. However, expenditure is likely to exceed budget estimates, reflecting the payment of the 13* month salary (which was not included in the budget) and possible overruns in expenditure on certain categories.g Nonetheless, based on more updated oil price projections, oil revenue is likely to be at least 50 percent higher than budgeted, resulting in an overall fiscal surplus (1.5 percent of GDP) for the first time in 17 years. There are indications, however, that additional late payments will be settled in 2000, which could offset the surplus and slightly increase the overall financing needs of the central government.” 18. Due to higher oil exports, the external current account will also improve considerably. Although imports are forecast to rise by close to 20 percent in connection wi the recovery in economic activity, the trade surplus is expected to double to about US$44 billion (26 percent of GDP) on account of higher oil and non-oil exports, and the current account is estimated to move into a surplus of US$ 11 billion, equivalent to 6.7 percent of GDP. .th III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS A. Structural Reforms 19. Employment of Saudi nationals remains the first priority of the authorities. The rapid growth rate of the population (3 percent), of which a large proportion will be entering the labor force in the next few years, has not been matched by a rapid real non-oil GDP growth.” As a result, unemployment among Saudi nationals is likely to have increased, even though statistical evidence is lacking pending completion of a labor database. The mission underscored the need to complete the labor market survey (which has been under preparation for more than two years), adopt the proposed revised labor law currently under consideration, and enhance the skills of the local labor force through training and upgrading the school curricula.L2 The authorities explained that the employment issue was being addressed through reforms aimed at accelerating growth in the non-oil sector, replacing expatriate workers with Saudi nationals, and providing training, in particular through the newly established Human Resource Development Fund. Also, they pointed to an increasing tendency for Saudis to 9 The 13* month salary is paid every three years to compensate for the difference between the Gregorian (365 days) and the Hijri (355 days) calendars. lo No precise indications on the magnitude of the settlement and stock of late payments were available at the time of the consultation discussions. ” Even though the population growth rate is reportedly slowing, the labor force is likely to continue to rise rapidly during the next few years. I2 The proposed labor law aims at enhancing flexibility in hiring and firing, and updating the regulations on various aspects of labor relations. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- become self-employed in connection with the rapid development of services. The mission reiterated the need to continue to exercise flexibility in replacing foreign workers with Saudis and suggested that the policy be phased in through market mechanisms, including enhancing the skills of Saudi nationals, increasing incentives for hiring and training Saudi employees in the private sector, and limiting recruitment in the public sector. 20. The mission underscored the need to implement reforms rapidly in order to put the economy on a high growth and employment path. It agreed that the authorities’ reform strategy to promote growth and employment was on track, and welcomed the bold initiatives taken recently to improve the business environment and attract foreign direct investment. The mission noted the potentially positive effects of an early approval of implementing regulations, in particular regarding the investment law and the operations of SAGIA. The authorities have already announced the income tax measures that are applicable to foreign companies pending the adoption of the new tax law, which is expected to be more favorable. 21. The mission emphasized the need to act simultaneously on several fronts for the reforms to produce maximum effects. It pointed out that while the privatization program covering two major sectors-telecommunications and electricity-was proceeding as scheduled, government could disengage fairly rapidly from other public companies that do not require major restructuring, such as the petrochemical company (SAFHC), hotels, and banks. The authorities broadly agreed, and indicated that privatization operations would cover, among others, SABIC and the Saudi Arabian Airline, with the latter requiring some restructuring. They are also considering involving the private sector in water desalination and treatment, roads, and railroads. B. Fiscal Policy 22. The mission commended the authorities for maintaining a tight expenditure stance under the 2000 budget despite the sharp increase in oil revenue. It noted, however, that the expenditure targets were likely to be exceeded given the payment of the 131h month salary and possible overruns on other outlays, following significant cuts over the past two years. In this context, strict expenditure control measures would be needed. The authorities explained that the existing expenditure control measures were being strengthened to better monitor budget implementation and avoid the accumulation of new late payments. 23. The mission pointed to the need to contain the growth of the wage bill. Despite the reduction in the number of civil servants by 50,000, the wage bill rose by 3.3 percent in 1999 and is projected to increase by almost the same rate in 2000, excluding the payment of thel3* month salary.13 The authorities attributed the increase to the ending of the I3 About 30,000 civil servants retired and 20,000 were transferred to the newly corporatized telecommunication company (STC) as a result of the removal of the telecommunications services from the government budget. The total size of the civil service is currently estimated at about 700,000.

They explained that the demographic dynamics in Saudi Arabia reduced the scope for adjusting the wage bill in the near future, particularly in the areas of education and health services, which absorb most new recruitment in the civil service. However, they stressed that enhanced training of civil servants would increase efficiency and limit hiring in the public sector. 24. The mission noted that the unpredictable settlement of sizable amounts of late payments could complicate fiscal management. While noting that these settlements have helped improve the payment track record of the government and enhanced its relations with private contractors and foreign suppliers, the mission called on the authorities to establish a detailed inventory of late payments and prepare a settlement plan, with annu~l payments being an explicit entry in the budget. The authorities emphasized the importance they attach to eliminating all late payments, most of which relate to commitments made over the past fifteen years. This, together with adequate control mechanisms, would help foster sound commitment and payment practices for government contracts. The staff encouraged the authorities to pursue these actions forcefUlly, and to provide early indication of the amounts of late payments to be settled annually, which would help enhance fiscal and debt management. 25. The authorities acknowledged that a continued increase in the domestic debt would be unsustainable and expressed the intention to use part of future privatization receipts to reduce the debt. At the equivalent of 118 percent of GDP at end-1999, the central government’s domestic debt has risen by more than 34 percentage points of GDP since the mid-1990s, reflecting in part the settlement of previously accumulated late payments. Interest payments on this debt amounted to 15 percent of total expenditure and 162 percent of capital expenditure. The mission agreed that the potential financial risks were low because almost 80 percent of this debt is held by cash-rich government entities, mainly the social security organization, and the pension fund (for civil servants).14 Nonetheless, the high debt and debt service payments added rigidity to fiscal management, and the risk element could not be ruled out altogether, especially if oil prices were to decline significantly in the coming years. The mission underscored the need to take advantage of the current favorable environment to introduce more lasting fiscal adjustment measures and reverse the rising trend in the domestic debt. 26. A fiscal adjustment strategy would need to be cast in a medium-term framework. The mission stressed the importance of achieving at a minimum fiscal balance by the year 2005 to reduce the debt (relative to GDP) under conservative oil price assumptions. Achieving this objective would require increasing non-oil revenue by about 3 percentage points of GDP to about 11 percent by 2005, and reducing government expenditure by around 4 percentage points to 28 percent of GDP. Such a reduction would I4 The debt held by the private sector was equivalent to only 26 percent of GDP at end- 1999. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - need to be accompanied by an improvement in the structure of expenditure (lower interest payments and higher expenditure for investment and social projects). In addition, a sizable proportion of privatization receipts would need to be earmarked to debt reduction.15 A fiscal adjustment scenario based on an oil price assumption of US$l8 per barrel on average during 2002-2005-against a WE0 projection of about US$20 per barrel-was used to illustrate the adjustment effort required to achieve the above objectives (Appendix I).16 The mission pointed out that these objectives could only be reached if key reforms are implemented, namely, introducing non-oil revenue measures (excises and indirect taxes, strengthening customs and tax administration, and improving the collection of fees and charges), raising transfers by the PIF to the budget, and reducing the growth of the wage bill. More generally, during periods of high oil prices, the authorities should aim at achieving relatively large fiscal surpluses that would help maintain the debt stock on a declining trend over the medium term. 27. The authorities remain committed to fiscal adjustment, but underscored the difficulty of setting medium-term fiscal targets given the uncertainty and volatility of oil prices. While agreeing that the volatility of oil prices and oil revenue made budgetary planning and fiscal management difficult, the staff pointed out that a medium-term path of fiscal adjustment-aimed in particular at reversing the debt dynamics-could be established based on certain assumptions that would need to be reviewed on a regular basis. For instance, the target could be to reach at a minimum a fiscal balance within the next four or five years, based on conservative oil price assumptions. Oil price and revenue deviations from this average would lead to accumulation/decurnulation of budget savings. 28. The staff highlighted the merit of smoothing out government expenditure, possibly through an oil stabilization fund. It noted that sudden and sharp cuts in government spending in connection with a drop in oil prices could result in the abandonment or delay of viable development projects and impose heavy costs on the private sector. Conversely, a sharp expansion in government spending during oil booms could result in poorly conceived and implemented projects and programs. Also, sharp fluctuations in government spending can transmit instability to the private sector and make it difficult for private firms to make long-term investment plans and decisions. Based on the experience of several oil producing countries with oil revenue stabilization funds, the staff argued that such a fund could potentially help deal with these issues, provided that it is operated on well- defined principles. Absent such a mechanism, the authorities could consider setting a ceiling ” The expected proceeds from the privatization of the telecommunications and electricity companies are not known, but are thought to be substantial. I6 Under current WE0 oil price assumptions, the adjustment scenario would result in a fiscal surplus of about 1.6 percent of GDP in 2004-05 on average.

The authorities agreed to further examine these issues and welcomed the staff work in this area in the context of the GCC -1MF cooperation.‘7 The staff also encouraged the authorities to focus on an optimal long-term fiscal strategy that would determine how much of the oil wealth to consume by the current generation and how much to save for fnture generations. ‘* C. Monetary Policy, Financial Sector, and Exchange Rate Issues 29. There has been no change in the framework of monetary and exchange rate policies. With the easing of liquidity conditions following the turbulence in 1998 and early 1999 in connection with the decline in oil prices and the speculative attacks against the Saudi Arabian riyal, SAMA has continued its liquidity management within the pegged exchange rate system.” For the year 2000, SAMA is expected to rebuild its foreign assets, private sector credit expansion is estimated to be in line with the pick up in economic activity, and interest rates will continue to closely track those on U.S. dollar assets. The real effective exchange rate of the Saudi Arabian riyal appreciated by about 6 percent between 1995 and 1999, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies (Chart 6). However, available information indicates that the international competitiveness of Saudi Arabia’s non-oil exports has not been affected during 1995-99 as evidenced by its stable market share of non-oil exportszo This reflects productivity gains in the petrochemical industry as well as the fact that the economy has continued to benefit from the availability of foreign workers at internationally competitive wage rates. 30. The strength of the financial system and its close supervision have helped it weather the effects of the drop in oil prices. A variety of indicators suggest that the Saudi banking system remains generally strong and well supervised (Table 5). The capital adequacy ratio far exceeds the Basle Committee recommended minimum for developing I7 This issue was discussed during the latest meeting between the First Deputy Managing Director and the GCC ministers of finance and governors of central banks, which took place on May 27, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A staff paper reviewing the experience and the lessons to be drawn from the operations of oil revenue stabilization funds was presented to the GCC ministers of finance on that occasion. ” Saudi Arabia: Recent Economic Developments and Selected Issues, September 2000. I9 SAMA operates within a rule-based framework similar to a currency board arrangement (including foreign exchange cover of 100 percent of domestic currency in circulation and prohibition of lending to the government). However, SAMA retains a degree of discretion in the conduct of monetary policy through repo transactions and foreign exchange swaps. 2o The decline in the value of non-oil exports in 1999 was due mainly to the decline in international prices of petrochemical products. For further analysis of competitiveness of non-oil exports see Saudi Arabia: Recent Economic Developments and Selected Issues, September 2000.

In response to the staff inquiry concerning the need to develop uniform guidelines for the classification of bank loans and provisioning, the authorities indicated that the relatively small number of banks in Saudi Arabia and the differences in their customer base and assets-liabilities structure reduced the need for uniform guidelines. They explained that conservative guidelines were developed by each individual bank in line with its specific needs and in consultation with SAMA. Nonetheless, the development of uniform guidelines would be considered in the near future. 31. The authorities confirmed that the trend toward bank mergers was not indicative of financial weaknesses nor would it affect competition in the banking sector. Rather, the mergers were motivated by the need of interested banks to take advantage of each other’s respective strengths (for example, advanced management in one bank and wider customer base in another). The authorities were confident that competition among domestic banks was adequate. In addition, because of the open economic system, Saudi banks were continually competing with regional and international banks. With regard to the government’s acquisition of half of the capital of the National Commercial Bank (NCB) in 1999 through the PIF, the authorities indicated that the government would divest itself of its equity share in NCB upon the completion of the bank’s restructuring plan. 32. Progress is being made in financial sector reform. In addition to further opening of the stock market to foreign investors through open-end mutual funds, the authorities are considering steps to enhance mortgage lending by the commercial banks, including through securitization of mortgages. This measure would complement the opening of real estate ownership to foreigners and help deepen the financial market. Efforts are underway to develop a secondary market for government securities and to introduce corporate bonds. D. WTO and Regional Integration 33. Saudi Arabia’s accession to the WTO is in prospect. A number of laws and regulations have been streamlined in the context of the preparation for WTO accession (law on trademark and intellectual property rights, the competition law, and visa and sponsorship regulations). Outstanding issues in the next round of negotiations, scheduled for September 2000, include requests by WTO members for concessions on government procurement and improvements in market access offers, particularly in the services sector. The authorities indicated that accession to WTO continued to receive wide support in Saudi Arabia, and was expected to improve the business environment. 34. Efforts have continued to advance regional integration within the GCC, including progress toward the establishment of a GCC common external tariff and a customs union. GCC members agreed in their summit meeting in Riyadh in December 1999 to launch a common tariff no later than March 2005. The agreement stipulated that imports Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - from outside the GCC area would be subject to a common external tariff with three rates: 0 percent on essential goods, 5.5 percent on basic goods, and 7.5 percent on other goods.21 The authorities explained that the loss of revenue from tariff unification for Saudi Arabia would be relatively small. The mission suggested that to enhance the effectiveness of the common external tariff, GCC member countries should also consider harmonizing their overall tax systems, including with respect to the introduction of indirect taxes.22 35. Regional integration efforts continued in other areas. Saudi Arabia has played a leading role in the efforts to implement the Arab Free Trade Area (AFTA), which aims to reduce customs tariffs on inter-Arab trade by 10 percent a year to zero percent by 2007; so far, this tariff has been reduced by 30 percent by 14 Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia. Within the GCC countries, progress has been made to further integrate the members’ stock markets, including the cross listing of, and trade in, the stocks of companies registered in various member countries. In 1999, the Bahrain-based Gulf International Bank (GIB), which is equally owned by GCC members, received permission to open a branch in Saudi Arabia following its merger with the London-based Saudi International Bank. Efforts have also been made to improve and harmonize legislations to facilitate real estate ownership by GCC individuals and companies, coordinate labor market policies among GCC countries, and advance the inter-linking of member countries’ electricity grids with the establishment of a GCC Electricity Grid Authority in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. 36. The regional discussions to establish a free trade zone between the GCC group and the European Union have continued. Outstanding issues in the negotiations seem to be the slow progress toward the establishment of a common GCC external tariff, and the EU’s proposals to exclude key imports from the GCC (mainly petrochemicals and aluminum) from the low tariff categories. 37. The authorities and GCC officials welcomed the Fund’s increased focus on regional issues. They were highly appreciative of the intensified collaboration between the Fund and the GCC through regular meetings between Fund management and the GCC ministers of finance and governors of central banks. This, together with technical assistance from the Fund, would help advance economic integration among the GCC countries. 21 In comparison, Saudi Arabia’s current import tariffs are zero, 12 percent, and 20 percent for a few products (with an estimated average effective tariff rate of about 8 percent). Hence, the goods falling in the 12-20 percent tariff range would be affected most by the implementation of the GCC agreed common tariff. ** Although the unified tariff agreement does not provide formal compensation for the potential loss of customs revenue to some member countries, the establishment of a special fund to address this issue is under consideration.

Efforts have been stepped up to improve the compilation and dissemination of economic and financial statistics. The Central Department of Statistics (CDS) has made noticeable progress in implementing the plan for conversion of the national accounts to the UN 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA).23 The required statistical surveys in various areas have been completed and would help update the base year of the CPI index and the national ‘accounts to 1999 (Appendix V). The authorities indicated that the CDS was working closely with SAMA to prepare a breakdown of the balance of payments into factor and nonfactor services to be used for the compilation of national accounts, and the Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MOFNE) had made progress in using GFS definitions consistent with the 1993 SNA. SAMA’s published annual report and monthly and quarterly bulletins provide comprehensive information on economic and financial developments. Moreover, since March 2000, monetary data have become available on a monthly basis on SAMA’s intemet website. In the fiscal area, the mission received detailed budgetary data, including the stock of the central government’s public debt, the distribution of the public debt by holders, amortization payments through 200 1, and the breakdown of the fiscal deficit financing between bank and nonbank sources. More recently, MOFNE has established a web site containing fiscal data and information on the operations of selected government agencies. 39. SAMA has made significant progress in implementing a medium-term program for the compilation of the balance of payments statistics in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPMS). A working group has been set up to implement the recommendations of Fund technical assistance missions in this regard and the required surveys were being completed. A preliminary draft of a manual for the compilation of Saudi balance of payments according to the BPMS classification has been prepared and is being finalized. The authorities have approached STA and suggested a regional training course on the introduction of BPMS that would be tailored to the specific conditions in the Gulf countries.24 On the revision of the definition of official international reserve assets, SAMA officials stated that such revision was completed in December 1999, in line with the recommendations of a joint STA-MED technical assistance mission. Accordingly, the revised reserves (about twice their level before the revision) included the foreign exchange currency cover (defined as currency outside banks) and the marketable foreign instruments that met the definition of international reserve assets. As such, the authorities felt that the new definition conformed to the BPM5 requirements. 23 This plan comprises, in addition to intensive theoretical and applied training, data conversion in three stages for the periods: 1998-2000,2000-02, and 2002-04. 24 The course is expected to take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in early 200 1.

The staff pointed out that national accounts continued to suffer from weaknesses, including discrepancies with other economic and financial data; the coverage of private capital flows in the balance of payments remains inadequate; and comprehensive labor market data is not yet available. Moreover, the lack of detailed information on the financial transactions of the AGIs and the PIF, as well as on the outstanding late payments, precludes the presentation of a consolidated position of the general government accounts. The staff team urged the authorities to promptly address the situation to allow for a more effective assessment of economic and financial developments and provide a complete picture of the public sector’s assets and liabilities. It also re-emphasized the need for regular reporting of fiscal data to the Fund so as to enhance economic surveillance between consultations. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 41. The Saudi economy has recovered from the effects of the 1998-99 sharp drop in oil prices. Strong fundamentals and sound economic management-aided by successful concerted efforts of major oil exporters to shore up oil prices-have helped contain the deterioration in the fiscal and external accounts, defend the exchange rate against speculative attacks, and preserve the integrity and soundness of the financial system. Lingering effects on growth are expected to dissipate rapidly with the strengthening of confidence, the upturn in oil prices, and the ongoing reforms. 42. The short-term outlook is favorable. Real growth is expected to pick up in 2000 to above-average trend, the fiscal and external account positions will move to surpluses, inflation will remain very low, and the financial situation of banks will strengthen further. The staff commends the authorities for having maintained a tight expenditure stance under the 2000 budget, despite the sharp increase in oil revenue, and calls for increased vigilance to achieve the budget expenditure targets and reverse the public debt dynamics, thereby creating more fiscal room for needed public investment and social outlays. 43. The staff commends the authorities for the important steps to improve the business environment and open the economy to foreign investment. The establishment of the Supreme Economic Council; the Supreme Council for Petroleum and Mineral Affairs; the approval of the investment law; and the decision to open the gas sector to investment by international oil companies are important steps toward attracting larger investment flows, fostering growth, and promoting employment creation. The staff also notes that a number of other reforms in various areas are under consideration and welcomes the progress toward the privatization of the electricity and telecommunication services. It encourages the authorities to take advantage of the synergies from the support of the political leadership for the reforms, the improved external environment, and the prospective accession to WTO to deepen the reform effort and expedite its implementation. In particular, the authorities would need to accelerate the tax reform-where progress to date has been slower than expected- and enhance the structure of government expenditure. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-27- 44. Facing up to the rising demand for employment by the young Saudi labor force will remain a major challenge in the period ahead, and the staff welcomes the fact that this is placed at the top of the authorities’ priorities. The staff agrees that the structural reforms now under way are likely to foster private sector development and enhance growth, thereby increasing employment opportunities for Saudi nationals. Nonetheless, supportive measures would be needed to better prepare the nationals to meet the skill requirements of the private sector, and shift their expectations away from public sector jobs. An important step in this direction would be for the authorities to complete the labor market survey to help improve the information on labor market dynamics and medium-tern prospects. The provision of adequate training would need to go hand-in-hand with efforts to promote private sector development, thereby allowing for a gradual replacement of expatriate workers through market mechanisms. The staff welcomes the establishment of the Human Resource Development Fund, and encourages the authorities to adopt the proposed labor law. A constant review of educational curricula will be necessary to ensure that students have the needed skills to meet the job requirements in a changing economy that is also integrating itself further in the world economy. 45. Fiscal restructuring is another challenging task. The staff commends the authorities for introducing new revenue raising measures in 1998 and maintaining a’ relatively tight expenditure stance in spite of the increase in oil prices. However, much remains to be done to bring about a lasting improvement in the fiscal position, reduce the debt to a sustainable level, and enhance the resilience of the fiscal accounts to fluctuations in oil prices. The staff underscores the need to set fiscal objectives in a medium-term framework, including achieving at a minimum fiscal balance by the middle of the decade and sustaining it thereafter under conservative oil price assumptions. This would require undertaking a more tidamental tax reform, involving the introduction of excises and indirect taxes; an overhaul of the income tax system; and the modemization of the customs and income tax administrations. In this regard, the staff encourages the authorities to enhance revenue collection by all relevant government agencies and to maximize the benefits of the technical assistance being provided by the Fund. On the expenditure side, the growth of the wage bill and other current expenditures would need to be contained mainly through civil service reform. Finally, the staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to use a large part of the privatization receipts to reduce the debt. 46. The staff continues to endorse the pegged exchange rate arrangement, which is supported by Saudi Arabia’s strong fundamentals, prudent macroeconomic management, and sound financial system. The current exchange rate regime, which has anchored stability and strengthened confidence, has successfully passed the test of resilience to exogenous shocks. The ongoing structural reform measures are likely to promote greater flexibility of the economy and enhance competitiveness, while further progress in fiscal consolidation and reduction of the domestic debt would significantly reduce vulnerability to oil price fluctuations. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - 47. The progress ht improving economic and financial data would need to be broadened and sustained. Progress was achieved in recent years to upgrade the statistical apparatus in Saudi Arabia and improve the availability of economic and financial data. However, as the economy is opening up to foreign investment, the reform effort is gaining speed, and accession to the WTO is within reach, efforts to enhance the statistical data base would need to move to a higher gear. In this context, while the data provision to the Fund has improved markedly, a further strengthening of the data base including consolidation of the fiscal accounts would help enhance the assessment of macroeconomic policies. The staff recommends that the authorities significantly strengthen data collection and compilation and increase the scope and periodicity of information that is released to the public, particularly with regard to government operations, the national accounts, labor market and wages, and capital movements.

These reforms are expected to increase the real growth of non-oil GDP to 4.5 percent a year towards the end of the projection period. This scenario is also based on unchanged crude oil output and exports from their current level, and on oil price assumptions in line with the projections under the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO). An alternative fiscal adjustment scenario is shown to illustrate the impact of stronger consolidation efforts aimed at achieving a more sustainable fiscal position over the medium term and reversing the rising trend in the central government’s debt relative to GDP.’ The baseline scenario incorporates the effects of the ongoing income tax reform and the strengthening of the tax department and assumes no further increases in fees and charges (from those implemented in 1998). As a result, non-oil revenue would remain stable at about 8 percent of GDP before declining towards the end of the projection period, owing to the loss in customs revenue following the adoption of a common external tariff (Appendix Table 1). However, total revenue as a percentage of GDP is expected to fall over the same years due to projected lower oil prices.’ Most expenditures are assumed to rise on average by about 3 percent a year in the projection period-in line with the average growth of nominal GDP- except the wage bill, which is projected to increase by 3.5 percent a year (a 13ti month salary would be paid in 2003), and capital outlays, which are assumed to rise by 5 percent a year. Subsidies are forecast to remain unchanged at their 2000-level. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit would deteriorate in the coming years from 1 percent of GDP in 2001 to over 6 percent by 2005. Under the assumption that the deficit would be entirely financed through domestic borrowing, the central government’s domestic debt would continue to rise. Consequently, interest payments as a percentage of total revenue would increase from 18 to 21 percent over the same period, or almost twice the projected Ievel of capital expenditure. Despite rising non-oil exports, the external current account balance would also deteriorate from a surplus of almost 2 percent of GDP in 2001 to a deficit of 7 percent by 2005. This deterioration would mainly reflect declining oil prices and government savings, and rising imports-in connection with increased investments by the private sector and the opening-up of the economy to foreign direct investment. Inflows of foreign direct investment and a drawdown of private assets could cover much of the external deficit. ’ See Saudi Arabia: Recent Economic Developments and Selected Issues, September 2000, for an assessment of the sustainability of Saudi Arabia’s fiscal stance. * Oil transfers to the budget are assumed to decline to 64 percent of oil export receipts in 2001 due to an expected increase in capital expenditure by Aramco, but would recover to 66 percent in 2002-05, in line with the average in the period 1998-99. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-35 - APPENDIX I Based on the same assumptions regarding the ongoing reforms and the transfer of oil revenue to the budget, the alternative fiscal adjustment scenario assumes a conservative oil price projection of US$lB per barrel on average during 2002-05-against almost US$20 per barrel in the current WE0 projections, and includes additional revenue and expenditure measures. On the revenue side, the scenario assumes the adoption of indirect taxes-with its full impact beginning in 2003; the strengthening of the customs and tax department administrations; and an improvement in the collection of fees and charges. It also calls for higher investment income transfers to the budget from the Public Investment Fund. Therefore, non-oil revenue would rise to 11 percent of GDP by 2005 (Appendix Table 2). On the expenditure side, this scenario assumes the same growth rate for capital expenditure, but lower growth rates of the wage bill, supplies and services, operations and maintenance, and a decline in subsidies by half from SRls 5 billion in 2001. It also assumes that part of the privatization receipts would be transferred to the budget to help retire government debt (US$ 5 billion a year during 2001-05). Total expenditure would then decline from 35 percent ‘of GDP in 1999 to 28 percent in 2005. Consequently, the fiscal position would reach balance by 2005 and the central government’s debt would go down to about 80 percent of GDP. The outcome of the alternative fiscal scenario would be substantially more favorable if higher oil prices are assumed.

Subsequently, the arrangement was renewed for a period of five years from December 26, 1993, and for another five-year period from December 28, 1998. Moreover, Saudi Arabia is participating in the New Arrangement to Borrow (NAB). VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement: Saudi Arabia maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions except for restrictions against Iraq and the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in accordance with Decision 144 (52/51). The Saudi Arabian riyal is formally pegged to the SDR at the rate of SRls 4.28255 = SDR 1, with margins of 7.25 percent; however, since mid-1981, observance of margins has been suspended. In practice, the Saudi Arabian riyal has been pegged to the US. dollar since 1986; the middle rate of the riyal against the U.S. dollar is SRls 3.7450 = US$l.

The World Bank maintains a special relationship with Saudi Arabia by providing reimbursable services through the Technical Cooperation Program (TCP), the largest such program for the Bank. It also provides a limited amount of nonreimbursable services. The program, which was initiated in FY 1975-76, peaked at 32 staff years in the mid- 198Os, declined in the following years, to 13 staff years in FY 1998-99. The Bank’s main counterpart is the Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MOFNE). 2. Historically the bulk of the technical assistance has been for infrastructure and for information systems. In the 199Os, however, the emphasis shifted more toward policy advice and implementation. Most recently, a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) was completed. Private sector development (PSD), which was initially a component of the CEM, emerged as an area of considerable activity. In FY 1998-99, several important initiatives were completed (e.g., corporatization of telecommunications, establishment of a privatization ministerial committee and implementation agency, feasibility study on National Railway Network, among others), and other projects were initiated (e.g., privatization of Saudi Arabian Airlines, pricing of water, reform of procurement procedures and restructuring of government’s grain-related policies). 3. Several joint ministry-bank workshops and symposia have been held, including on health care reform, wateriwastewater sector reform, investment promotion, IPPS and small- and medium-enterprise reform, among others. Also, the World Bank Institute is actively involved in offering courses for and in cooperation with the Kingdom’s Institute of.Public Administration.

In 1998-2000, the Central Department of Statistics (CDS) implemented several new surveys, which aimed at converting the national accounts from the 1968 System of2V’ationaZAccount.s (SlvA) to the 1993 SNA, and changing the base year from 1970 to 1999 for the constant price calculations. These surveys included the annual economic survey of establishments (1998, 1999); the manufacturing sector survey (1998); the transportation sector survey (1998); the household expenditure and income survey (1999); the household-based labor force survey (1999); the establishment-based wages and salaries survey (1999); the agricultural sector survey (1999); and the demographic survey (1999). The full results of the labor survey will be published soon; the 2000 labor survey has started at the beginning of May; and the 2000 demographic survey is scheduled to start by late 2000. Other proposed economic surveys include the compilation of import and export price indices (annual, starting 2001), and the input and output industrial production indices (five-yearly, starting 200 1). However, the compilation of the national accounts is still impaired by delays in receiving detailed data on fiscal and petroleum developments. There are long delays in the availability of data on the oil sector; aggregate expenditures are compiled only at current prices and do not include estimates for government consumption of fixed capital; industrial production indices, data on employment, unemployment, and earnings are not yet available; the weights used in the CPI and the PPI are more than 10 years old. Furthermore, the CDS is still working with SAMA to prepare a breakdown of the balance of payments into factor and nonfactor services to be used by the CDS in the compilation of national accounts. The authorities are working on establishing a database on labor markets in Saudi Arabia. They provided preliminary estimates on employment by sector and results for 1998 from a survey undertaken by the Ministry of Labor on employment in large establishments (with more than 20 employees). The National Computer Center is also conducting a labor market survey, which will significantly improve the labor market data base. However, the expected date of completion of the exercise is uncertain. Fiscal sector During consultation missions, the authorities provide detailed information on the operations of the central government, including the stock of the gross domestic debt, the distribution of government debt by holders, amortization payments, and the breakdown of the fiscal financing between bank and nonbank sources. In addition, statistical information is provided on the Saudi Fund for Development, and some data on the General Organization for Social Insurance and the Public Investment Fund (PIF), as well as on four other lending institutions (Saudi Agricultural Bank, Saudi Credit Bank, Saudi Industrial Development Fund, and Real Estate Development Fund). However, there has been no progress in publishing detailed fiscal data and in presenting a consolidated situation of the public finances (central government, PIF, and autonomous government institutions). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-44- APPENDIX V Following recommendations by the September 1997 Fund technical assistance mission on fiscal accounts, the authorities are working to fully address remaining weahesses in the fiscal data. As a first step, expenditure on wages and salaries has been reclassified to be fully captured in Chapter I of the Budget according to the UN System of National Accounts (SNA) methodology. Also, the Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MOFNE) has taken some steps in using Government Finance Statistics (GFS) definitions to put national data in a format consistent with the 1993 SNA. Moneta y data Most financial data are readily available in SAMA’s Monthly Statistical Bulletin, published with about one-month lag and available since March 2000 on the SAMA website. In particular, commercial bank data are adequate and are provided on a regular basis. Monetary data for SAMA are provided to the Fund on a monthly basis. However, liabilities are provided in aggregates without detailed breakdown into components (e.g., no indication of foreign liabilities), which does not permit an accurate compilation for the monetary survey. More disaggregated data on SAMA’s liabilities are only provided during consultation missions. As of August 3 1,2000, the authorities provided the following monthly data for publication in International Finance Statistics (IFS):’ currency issued and currency in circulation, deposit money banks’ accounts, and interest rates on deposits and the domestic share prices index, all through July 2000 (interest rates on government bonds are not published); and quarterly consolidated accounts of other financial institutions through the fourth quarter of 1999. At the authorities’ request, SAMA’s quarterly accounts, which are available through the first quarter of 2000, cannot be published in IFS until audited (the last data published in the IFS is for the first quarter of 1999.) The authorities have revised the definition of official international reserves in light of the recommendations of a STA-MED mission (May 16-19, 1998). The authorities conducted a review of the methodology for compiling their reserves, as a result of which data on Saudi Arabia’s reserves for January 1996-October 1999 were revised upward by over 100 percent for most dates. The authorities noted that these reserves included the currency cover (defined as currency outside banks) and other foreign marketable instruments (which are judged by the authorities to meet the criteria for classification as official international reserves). No information was provided on the composition of foreign assets that were excluded from the revised official international reserve data. Balance of payments Progress is being made to improve the balance of payments statistics, although some data (mainly financial and capital accounts) are not yet compiled or reported according to the BaZance of Payments Manual, Fzfth Edition (BPM.5). Only the major items of the balance of ’ The monthly reports also include weekly data on money supply M 1, M2, and M3. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - APPENDIX V payments are reported, and limited breakdown is provided. Although the oil sector statistics are published in SAMA ‘s annual reports, there is a need to reconcile these data with those in the real sector. Compilation of data on services, income, and transfers as well as on the financial and capital accounts needs to be improved. While customs data are satisfactory, some public sector imports of goods are incorrectly classified as services. The 1997 STA mission on balance of payments assisted the authorities in reclassifying the data according to the Fund methodology, and recommended new collection methods that would allow SAMA to convert the balance of payments to the new presentation within a relatively short period. SAMA had made significant progress in implementing these recommendations, in particular in the design and dispatch of survey forms used for data collection, including from: the MOFNE and several other government agencies and ministries; a large number of private sector companies, including telecommunication and transportation companies; and financial institutions. Finally, to improve the compilation of balance of payments data in accordance with the BPMS, the authorities are planning to organize a seminar together with STA scheduled to take place in early 2001. Data publication Publication is generally limited to officially finalized and approved data. Data on real,sector, national accounts, financial sector, budgetary accounts, and balance of payments are published in official documents, such as the CDS and the SAMA annual reports (the 1999 annual report was published in October 1999 and contains data up to end-1998, and up to March 1999, whenever available). In addition, as mentioned above, main financial data are available in SAMA’s Monthly Statistical Bulletin with about one month lag and since March 2000 on the SAMA website. The budget document is not published but limited actual fiscal data are published in SAMA’s annual report. Data provided to the consultation missions are available in the Fund documents and intended for internal circulation.
