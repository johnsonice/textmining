Fiji has su!Tered from low growth (averaging 2% percent) since the mid- 1970s. ECconotnic prospects have been further clouded since 1987 by political and economic uncertainties over constihltional matters and the renewal of agricultural land leases. . Fiji’s economic performance improved in 1994, spurred by the recovery of production Corn the adverse effects of cyclone Kina Real GDP gmti rose to 4% percent, inflation declined to below 1 percent, and the external position improved. The tinancial policy stance was generally tighter. . Prospects are that real GDP goti will weaken in 1995, reflecting a decline in sugar production to a more sustainable level, and slower gmwth in tourism. However, with weak domestic demand, inflation is expected to remain low and the extemal position is expected to improve markedly. . A banking crisis was averted in early 1995 and the authorities have intensified efforts to strengthen banking supervision. Policy Issues . The appropriateness of fmancial policies in 1995 and over the medium term, in light of a projected increase in the budget deficit. . The appropriateness of the exchange rate, in light of B mn on foreign reserves in late 1994 and the real appreciation of the exchange rate since 1987. . Measures to move the economy to a higher growih path, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. StaffPosition . In light of the weakness in private demand for credit, the iinancial policy stance in 1995 seems appropriate, notwithstanding some widening in the budget deficit. . External competitiveness appears adequate, in light of the strong performance of the external sector in recent years. To preserve competitiveness and enable the economy to adapt to the challenges of a changing world trade environment over the medium term, measures are needed to restructure and diversify the cconorny. . To &prove medium-term prospects, the authorities should maintain tight fmancial policy, speed up the implementation of sbuchxal reforms, and address the uncertainties over the constititional and land issues.

Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Fiji were held in Suva during August 10-22, 1995.’ In concluding the last consultation, Executive Directors noted the pickup in Fiji’s economic growth in 1994, which was achieved with relative price stability, while maintaining comfortable international reserves and reducing the stock of external debt. To strengthen medium-term prospects, Directors emphasized the need to raise investment through fiscal consolidation and to liberalize trade. Directors believed that exchange rate policy remained appropriate, provided it was supported by financial and wage restraint. The statistical base of Fiji is reasonably solid reflecting, in part, technical assistance provided over the years. The core minimum data are reported on a regular and timely basis and most economic data are published regularly. However, some weaknesses persist, particularly in the areas of national accounts and the balance of payments, where technical assistance is being provided, mainly through the UNDP-IMF Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. II. Economic Setting A. Background Fiji is one of the largest and most developed of the Pacific island economies, with a per capita income of US%2,300 and a population of 780,000. Like most Pacific island economies, development has been constrained by high transportation costs, vulnerability to adverse weather and external shocks, and the limited size of the domestic market. Since the military coups in 1987, the economy has been adversely affected by a persistent lack of confidence as reflected in an outflow of skilled labor and professionals, and a marked decline in saving and private investment (Chart I). The situation has been exacerbated by uncertainty over the renewal of agricultural land leases.’ Since the mid-1970s economic growth has fluctuated around an average rate of about 2% percent per annum (Table 1). While social economic ‘The staff team consisted of Messrs. Khor (Head), Cangiano, Faruqee (all SEA), and Zimmerman (OMD). Ms. Kelly (SEA) participated in the policy discussions. The staff met with the Minister of Finance, the Reserve Bank Governor, and other senior officials and private sector representatives. Mr. Ng, Assistant to the Executive Director for Fiji, participated in the discussions. Fiji has accepted the obligations of Article VIII. ‘Uncertainty over the renewal of agricultural land leases (about half of which are on native land) which will expire over the next 2-7 years, has discouraged farmers from undertaking fixed investments or making capital improvements, and the banks from providing loans to the agricultural sector.

To raise the growth potential, the Government has pursued a more outward-oriented strategy since the late 1980s. In 1987-88, the exchange rate was devalued sharply and fiscal incentives were introduced to attract foreign investment and, in 1989, a structural reform program was adopted. This strategy led to an initial surge of foreign investment into the manufacturing sector, mainly to take advantage of Fiji’s preferential access to the United States, Australia, and New Zealand markets. However, reflecting the slow implementation of structural reforms, the strong inflows of foreign investment were not sustained although, more recently, there have been signs of renewed confidence in the private sector, especially in the hotel industry. While the economy has become more diversified over the years, with garments emerging as an important export industry, it remains dependent on the sugar and tourism sectors, which account for 40 percent of foreign exchange earnings. B. Recent Developments and Near-Term Prospects Fiji’s economic performance improved in 1994, mainly reflecting a recovery from ihe adverse effects of cyclone Kina in 1993 and tighterfinancialpolicies Macroeconomic stability has been preserved in 1995, although growth has slowed Real GDP growth rose to 4% percent in 1994, spurred by record sugar production and tourist arrivals (Table 2). Strong growth in exports of goods and nonfactor services more than offset a contraction in domestic demand, the latter on account of a decline in government consumption and lower investment by public enterprises. Growth is projected to slow to its long-term rate of 2% percent in 1995, because of a decline in sugar production to a more sustainable level and slower growth in tourism. Other sectors, including fisheries, forestry, and manufacturing, are performing well. Inflation declined to % percent in 1994, reflecting tighter financial policies and weakness in domestic demand, low imported inflation, and wage settlements of 2-3 percent, about half the rate of 1993, with the public sector leading the way. Wage increases have been moderate so far in 1995, and inflation is likely to remain below 2 percent. The external position improved in 1994. Buoyed by earnings from the sugar and tourism sectors, the current account deficit narrowed from 4% percent of GDP in 1993 to 3 percent of GDP in 1994, and was accompanied by a decline in the overall deficit to % percent of GDP (Table 3 and Chart 2). In line with the authorities’ policy to prepay debt, total external debt was reduced to 13% percent of GDP at end-1994 and the debt-service ratio declined to below 9 percent.

The external position is expected to improve Ruther in 1995. The current account is projected to shift to a surplus of about % percent of GDP, reflecting a weakening in domestic demand. Imports and factor payments abroad are expected to decline, while lower receipts from sugar and tourism will be more than offset by higher official transfers and growth in other exports (fish, forestry products, and garments). The capital account surplus is projected to increase, reflecting a reduction in debt repayments by public enterprises, and a buildup in foreign currency deposits with commercial banks; the latter declined last year in the context of rumors about devaluation. As a result, the overall balance of payments is projected to shift into a large surplus. Following the devaluations in 1987, the exchange rate of the Fiji dollar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies of the five largest trading partners, appreciated by 15 percent through February 1994, reflecting higher inflation in Fiji relative to its major trading partners (Chart 3). With lower inflation in 1994, the appreciating trend was halted and the Fiji dollar has since depreciated by 3 percent. The budget deficit was more than halved to 1% percent of GDP in 1994, due mainly to a reduction in current outlays on goods and services (Table 4 and Chart 4). Capital expenditure rose somewhat, reversing part of the diversion of funds to operating outlays that occurred in 1993 on account of cyclone rehabilitation. Contrary to initial expectations, tax performance also improved, reflecting increased collections of the value-added tax. Available data show that overall profits of the nonfinancial public enterprises were about unchanged during 1990-93. However, budgetary appropriations to the public enterprises have declined since 1991 and are budgeted to decline further in 1995. Monetary conditions were generally tighter in 1994. Led by a reduction in net credit to the public sector, domestic credit expansion fell to 4 percent and the 12-month growth in broad money (M2) decelerated to 3 percent (Table 5 and Chart 5). The decline in net credit to the government resulted from the improved fiscal performance and, more importantly, a substitution ofoutstanding bank credit with longer-term financing from the nonbank sector. Interest rates rose in real terms, as nominal interest rates declined only slightly, notwith- standing the reduction in inflation.

The top management was dismissed and its operations put under strict supervision of the Reserve Bank. The authorities announced that its deposits would be fully guaranteed and the Reserve Bank stood ready to provide liquidity. An external audit was commissioned and a plan is being developed to recapitalize and restore the bank to normal commercial operations over the next few years; preliminary estimates indicate that this could require as much as F$70-100 million (about 2%-3X percent of GDP) over the next five years. The crisis has not affected other banks as their exposure to the NBF is small. In the wake of the NBF crisis, the Reserve Bank intensified its efforts to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework of the banking system, and sought external assis- tance to improve its supervisory capability. A new Banking Act was enacted in June 1995, which subjects all banks (both domestic and foreign) to an annual audit and greater disclosure requirements. In addition, banks have been given until end-1997 to comply with the capital adequacy ratio established under the Basle Convention. The Reserve Bank has formulated new guidelines on asset classifications, in line with international practices, IIL Report on the Discussions The discussions with the authorities took place against the background of Fiji’s weak long-term growth performance, its reasonably favorable current macroeconomic conditions, and the crisis of the NBF. They focused on: (i) the appropriateness of financial policies in 1995 and over the medium term, and the implications of the NBF crisis for the budget; (ii) exchange rate policy; and (iii) measures to enhance growth potential. A. Financial Policies The mission agreed with the authorities’ view that, notwithstanding the weakness in aggregate demand, the relatively tight financial policies that have been in place over the last few years should be maintained to preserve price stability; Fiji’s slow growth should be addressed from the supply side by speeding up structural reforms, 1. Fiscal policy The staff agreed with the authorities that the stance of fiscal policy in 1995 was not inappropriate, as the higher deficit could be financed without crowding out private sector credit needs. The overall budget deficit is projected to widen (by one percentage point) to 2% percent of GDP, about the same as the original budget forecast.’ The budget provided for an increase in the personal income tax threshold which, together with lower transfers from the Reserve Bank, was expected to reduce total revenue by about 1 percent of GDP. Total expenditure was projected to be little changed from the previous year, as a decline in capital ‘At the time the budget was formulated, the deficit for 1994 was projected at 3 percent of GDP. In the event, the 1994 deficit was lower by 1% percentage points of GDP.

As in 1994, the overall deficit was to be financed mainly through the issuance of long-term bonds to the nonbank sector. To make room for a needed recovery in private investment, lower the high level of public debt (40 percent of GDP), and reduce the size of government, the authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal consolidation. As a result of the recent tax reform, the authorities considered that the tax structure was broadly appropriate. Thus, they intended to focus their efforts on reducing operating expenditures, especially the wage bill. Expenditure would be restructured in favor of infrastructure projects, education, and training, in order to enhance the productive capacity of the economy. The authorities noted that they had succeeded in resisting pressures to implement the results of a civil service job evaluation exercise, which would have cost about 2% percent of GDP. The mission supported the authorities’ intended fiscal strategy, which would also help to raise national saving over the medium term. With regard to government revenue, the mission noted that, although tax collections had improved in 1994, there was still scope for improved revenue performance by strengthening tax administration. Nevertheless--given that Fiji’s tax ratio was already higher than that in most developing countries--the mission agreed that fiscal consolidation should rely mainly on expenditure reduction, especially through reducing the wage bill, which is large relative to GDP.’ Given that substantial budgetary resources are likely to be required for the NBF, the mission emphasized that a careful prioritization of all categories of current expenditures would be desirable. 2. Monetary policy Reflecting the slow pace of economic activity, monetary and credit aggregates continued to decelerate in the first half of the year: the 12-month growth rate of broad money (M2) declined to zero at end-June 1995, while that of net domestic credit declined to about 1 percent. Taking these developments into account, the Reserve Bank’s revised monetary program for 1995 envisages that M2 will grow by about 4% percent in 1995, while net domestic credit will increase by 2% percent; the program allows for an accumulation in official reserves, which will raise the import coverage to about five months.6 The mission agreed with the authorities that monetary growth and credit expansion should be consistent with both the maintenance of price stability and an accumulation in official reserves. The mission observed, however, that in current circumstances, there was a ’ At about 12 percent of GDP, the size of the wage bill in Fiji is about twice the average for most developing countries and slightly above the average for the Pacific island economies. Government employment constitutes about one fourth of formal employment in Fiji. 6During the past year, the Reserve Bank has implemented many measures to improve the monetary policy framework in accordance with the recommendations of a mission from the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department that visited Suva in September 1994.

In this context, the authorities noted that the reserve target had been set on the basis of an expected improvement in the external sector and, thus far, developments had been in line with their projections. If external performance were to weaken, they would lower the reserve target to ensure that credit expansion to the private sector remained adequate and would aim to achieve the higher reserve target over a longer period. 3. Exchange rate policy The authorities were generally of the view that the current exchange rate policy should be maintained. However, in light of the run on foreign reserves in late 1994, real appreciation of the Fiji dollar since the major adjustments of 1987, and the lingering concern in the private sector over external competitiveness, they solicited the mission’s view on the appropriateness of exchange rate policy. The mission observed that, although the appreciation of the Fiji dollar had eroded some of the initial gain in competitiveness resulting from the 1987 devaluations, the current level of the real exchange rate was still about 15 percent more depreciated than that prevailing just before the devaluations, and 30 percent more depreciated than the average level in the first half of the 1980s.’ Part of the appreciation was attributable to the pass-through effect on domestic prices in a small open economy like Fiji. However, the external sector had performed well in the past few years; both sugar and tourist receipts had reached record levels; garment exports were buoyant; and new export industries had emerged. Looking ahead, the mission noted that the competitiveness of some exports, particularly sugar and garments, could be adversely affected as Fiji’s preferential access to its major markets was reduced or phased out as a result of the Uruguay Round and regional trade agreements. The authorities should, therefore, adopt measures to restructure the sugar industry and ensure its competitiveness, and diversify the economy. In this connection, the mission stressed the need to maintain price stability and speed up structural reforms. B. Medium-Term Prospects and Structural Policy Issues The major challenge facing the authorities is to move the economy to a higher growth path, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. In the staffs view, these goals are achievable, provided: (i) price stability and external balance are maintained through tight financial policies; (ii) the structural reform agenda is completed; and (iii) the economic and ‘Following the Plaza Accord in 1985, the Fiji dollar depreciated by about 15 percent in real effective terms in the period through mid-1987. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - political uncertainties over land and constitutional issues’ are addressed. In the event of slippages in policy implementation, growth is likely to remain weak (see Annex I). Progress has been achieved in trade liberaliiation under which tariffs on imports have been lowered and quantitative controls virtually abolished. The authorities considered that the economy had adjusted reasonably well to the more competitive environment, and intended to persist with trade reform despite pressures from local producers to roll back some of the tariff reductions. The mission argued that the benefits would become more evident over time as the economy adjusts to increased foreign competition, and encouraged the 8uther streamlining of the liberalized trade regime. They also noted that openness had lowered costs and restrained inflationary pressures. Progress has been made in the area of tar reform--personal income tax rates have been reduced and a greater part of the tax burden has been shifted to broad-based indirect taxes.“ While agreeing that the current tax structure was broadly appropriate, the mission noted that the corporate tax rate was still relatively high compared with some of the more dynamic Asian countries, and encouraged the authorities to lower tax rates further. To minim&e the impact on the budget, it was suggested that the tax reduction be implemented in the context of plans to reform the fiscal incentives system and to improve tax administration. Policies on investment promotion have been less successful. The staff team encouraged the authorities to simplify and streamline the fiscal incentives system with a view to reducing its distortionary effects. lo In addition, they suggested that addressing the uncertainties over constitutional and land issues would be an effective way to encourage investment. In this connection, the representatives from the Native Land Trust Board (NLTB)” said that a decision had been made to focus first on the sugar land leases in the current review of all native land leases. The mission proposed an acceleration of enterprise reform as only three enterprises had been corporatized to date. The authorities observed that a bill had recently been submitted to Parliament which would empower the Government to reorganize all activities of *The 1990 Constitution, which guarantees a parliamentary majority to the indigenous Fijians, is undergoing an independent review to be completed by 1997. 9 The personal income tax was simplified and the top marginal rate aligned at 35 percent with the corporate tax rate. A VAT set at a flat rate of 10 percent was introduced in 1992. A summary of the tax system is contained in the accompanying background paper. “A mission from the Fiscal AfFairs Department visited Suva in March 1995 to review and make recommendations to reform the fiscal incentives system for investment. “NLTB is a statutory body which was established to manage all native land on behalf of the indigenous Fijian population who own about 83 percent of the land in Fiji.

In this context, a plan had been established to corporatize or privatize 16 public enterprises over the next 12 months. With regard to the labor market, the mission supported the recent efforts to move toward a wage system which would link increases in wages and salaries to productivity growth; such a system would help to preserve price stability. IV. Staff Appraisal Fiji’s economy has recovered from the adverse effects of cyclone Kina in 1993, inflation has declined to a low level, and the external position has strengthened. However, the average growth rate is still quite low, private confidence remains weak, and domestic investment has fallen to an historically low level. The authorities’ key policy challenge is to pursue policies that will allow the economy to move to a higher growth path, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Following a strong improvement in 1994, the budget deficit is expected to widen in 1995. While this should not crowd out private investment, the staff would encourage the authorities to return to their goal of fiscal consolidation over the medium term, in order to raise national saving and make room for the needed recovery in private investment. There is further scope for improving revenue performance by strengthening tax administration. At the same time, the staff supports the authorities’ intention to reduce operating expenditures, particularly the wage bill, while restructuring expenditures toward infrastructure projects, education, and training. Such a reorientation would help ease the supply constraints and enhance the productive capacity of the economy. In light of the vulnerability of the economy to exogenous shocks, the authorities are prudent in aiming to raise the level of foreign reserves to about five months of import coverage. The monetary program for 1995 has been formulated with this objective in mind, taking into account the need to maintain price stability and the expected improvement in the external sector. Nevertheless, in light of the current weakness in domestic demand, it would be prudent to monitor closely developments and adjust the program targets, if necessary, to ensure that credit to the private sector remains adequate. With regard to the exchange rate, the staff is of the view that the external competitiveness of Fiji remains adequate, particularly in light of the performance of the external sector in recent years and the prevailing low inflation. Looking ahead, however, it is likely that certain export industries could be adversely affected by the phasing out of preferential access to major markets. Hence, the authorities should take measures to improve productivity and restructure and diversify the economy, while maintaining appropriately tight financial policies to sustain low inflation. The staff supports present efforts to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework of the banking system. In particular, the new Banking Act should enhance transparency through greater disclosure requirements, and the planned adoption of a new asset classification system should improve prudential oversight. The authorities are to be Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-22 - commended for the decisive manner in which they have dealt with the financial crisis of the NBF, which has helped to maintain confidence in the banking system. The economy has become more competitive as a result of the structural measures implemented under the outward-oriented economic strategy adopted since the late 1980s and there are signs of renewed confidence on the part of private investors. The staffwould urge the authorities to speed up the completion of ongoing structural reforms--particularly in the areas of fiscal consolidation, public enterprises, investment promotion, and the labor market-- and address the uncertainties over the constitutional and land issues, Progress in these areas would improve the policy environment and set the stage for a sustained increase in domestic investment, which is essential for the economy to move to a higher growth path. As regards statistical issues, the authorities are to be commended for the generally high quality of the economic and financial data, which are published on a regular basis. The staff supports efforts to improve the national accounts and balance of payments statistics. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Fiji be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

In the staffs view, developments in Fiji during the past year do not warrant a fundamental change to the baseline scenario. However, as indicated in the report, the staff is of the view that Fiji has the potential to improve its growth performance significantly. Table 6 presents a reform scenario which is based on the following key assumptions: (i) the stance of financial policies would remain appropriately tight to maintain price stability and external balance; (ii) the structural reform agenda would be completed over the next 2-3 years; and (iii) the current political uncertainties related to constitutional matters and agricultural land lease renewals would be resolved quickly. Under this scenario, private sector confidence and investment sentiments would be restored with the improvement in the policy environment, while competitiveness would be greatly enhanced by the structural measures and improvement in infrastructure, enabling Fiji to adjust to the changing global economic environment. As to the stance of financial policy, the scenario would require that the budget deficit (including funds necessary to recapitalize the National Bank of Fiji) be largely eliminated over the next five years, and that money growth would be kept in line with nominal GDP growth. Fiscal consolidation would be achieved mainly through cuts in operating expenditure, particularly the wage bill, while the resources would be redirected toward more productive types of expenditures such as infrastnrcture, training, and education. Against this background, gross domestic investment as a share of GDP would increase back to the pre-1987 levels (by about 7 percentage points of GDP). This higher level of investment would be financed through rising national savings as well as an increase in foreign savings, National savings would rise on account of the fiscal consolidation and on improvement in public sector savings. The increase in foreign savings would reflect a higher level of capital inflows, especially foreign direct investment. The overall external balance would remain in surplus, with foreign reserves staying at above 4% months of import cover. There would be a moderate rise in the external debt/GDP ratio but the debt-service ratio would remain low.

Nonfinancial Relations Exchange Rate Arrangement Since April 1975, the exchange rate of the Fiji dollar has been linked to a basket of currencies of Fiji’s five major trading partners: the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the pound sterling; and the Japanese yen. The weights used in the basket are based mainly on the value of trade, tourist transactions, and external debt service. The exchange rate is determined daily in relation to the currency basket, The Reserve Bank’s buying and selling rates for transactions in U.S. dollars are communicated to commercial banks. Since the major devaluations in 1987 (17% percent on June 29 and 15% percent on October 7), the Fiji dollar has been stable against the basket of currencies. The exchange rate was FSl.43 per U.S. dollar on August 31, 1995. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation The 1994 Article IV consultation discussions were held during August 1994.

However, a few weaknesses persist (see below). These have been well identified and technical assistance is being provided, mainly through the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre in Suva. The authorities are hdly cooperative in providing data to the Fund in a timely manner. In addition to the periodic information provided to the Statistics Department (STA), the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) faxes the News Review to SEA on a weekly basis. As to official statistical publications, the RBF publishes the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review, and the Monthly Economic Bulletin; and the Fiji.Bureau of Statistics publishes a quarterly Current Economic Statistics and monthly Statistical News. Each year, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issues the Budget Address and the Supplement to the Budget Address. All of these publications are received by SEA on a regular basis. 1. National Accounts Fiji has not produced the national accounts by expenditure at constant prices since 1989. Delays in reporting expenditure components of the national accounts at current prices have been reduced during the past year. The Fiji Bureau of Statistics has just completed rebasing the national accounts from 1977 to 1989. 2. Prices The consumer price index has been recently rebased to the average for the period from July to December 1993. The new basket of goods and services contains 33 1 items, 65 more than the old one. Data on wages remain weak and are reported to the Fund with considerable delay (the index of wages has not been reported since 1992). There are persistent difficulties in compiling export and import unit values, mainly owing to a lack of qualified staff. 3. Government Finance Statistics Fiji is a regular reporter of data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook. However, some inconsistencies remain between the GFS data and fiscal data provided to SEA, especially in the areas of nontax revenue, wages and salaries, other purchases of goods and services, and subsidies and transfers. The STA database includes data on central government budgetary operations through 1994. Government debt data reported by the authorities for the years 1987 through 1990 have not been included in the database, owing to methodological problems. (Debt data were apparently being reported on a net rather than a gross basis). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3o- ANNEXIV 4. Monetary Statistics Statistics on the monetary authorities and deposit money banks are comprehensive and are provided to STA on a regular and timely basis. 5. Balance of Payments In the balance of payments area, problems remain in the capital account. These seem to derive from the absence of a consistent framework and insufficient coordination among the Reserve Bank, the Fiji Bureau of Statistics, and the Ministry of Fiice and Economic Development. For instance, data on central government and other official entities’ debt and debt-related flows provided by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development are not consistent with the information provided by the Reserve Bank.

The World Bank has been a major contributor to Fiji’s development program since independence in 1970. To date, Fiji has received 13 loans totaling USS147.3 million (net of cancellations). The share of the IBRD in Fiji’s long-term (disbursed) debt outstanding at the end of 1993 was 15.2 percent, and the share of debt service was 23.2 percent. 2. Lending operations have included loans for the development of Fiji’s infrastructure and financial services. Approvals have included a third telecommunications project (1989) of US$8.1 million to help finance the expansion and modemization of telecommunications facilities; a housing project for low-income families (1990); and a second road upgrading project of US.51 5 million (1992). The latter project (cofinanced with the AsDB and the EXIM Bank of Japan) is to assist economic development, particularly in rural areas, through a program of rehabilitation and improvement of existing road links. 3. In 1995, the Bank completed a country report on Fiji, in addition to the third Pa@ Islands Regional Economic Report. The report addresses the critical issues affecting Fiji’s economic performance, including: how to restore economic growth sufficient to provide jobs for the steady expansion of the labor force and to improve living standards of all Fijians; and ‘Prepared by World Bank staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33 - ANNEXV diversification of the economy to reduce vulnerability to volatile export markets and take advantage of opportunities emerging from the changing global environment. In addition, country reports on Fiji have been prepared as part of the Bank’s Pacific regional studies on energy, post-secondary education, health, and transportation. Technical assistance was provided to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development to examine the financial structure, operations, and management controls of the National Bank of Fiji. 4. IFC has approved five investments in Fiji totaling USS3 million. The first two operations were aimed at strengthening the traditional sectors: a US$6 million investment to rehabilitate and expand the country’s sugar milling capacity; and a USS8.8 million investment to help finance a 300-room international hotel in order to ease capacity constraints in the upscale tourist sector. Two operations have been in support of the development of nontraditional industries: an investment of USD.6 million to support a forestry products project; and an investment of US%3 million to establish a merchant bank that will facilitate private sector purchasing or leasing of equipment. Approval was given in 1993 for a USSl million investment to assist in the development of cut flower exports and a USS4.2 million investment to expand garment production. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service is assisting the Government in reviewing existing tax concessions, import duty concessions, and other incentives. An initial report has been prepared.
