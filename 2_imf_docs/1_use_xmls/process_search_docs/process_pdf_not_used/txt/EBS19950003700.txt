Introduction Estonia's second stand-by arrangement (SBA), equivalent to SDR 11.625 million (25 percent of quota), and a first purchase under the Systemic Transformation Facility (STF) equivalent to SDR 11.625 million (25 percent of quota), were approved by the Executive Board on October 27, 1993 in support of a program for the period July 1, 1993 to December 31, 1994. The first purchase under the SBA of SDR 2.325 million and the first purchase under the STF (SDR 11.625 million) were made in November 1993. The second, third, and fourth purchases under the SBA (SDR 2.325 million each), and the second purchase under the STF, were made following completion of the second review under the SBA in January 1995. While all performance criteria for end-March and end-June 1994 had been met, u completion of the second review of the program was delayed as a result of issues related to Bank of Estonia's financial support to the Social Bank. The 1994 Article IV consultation (together with the first review under the SBA) were completed on April 8, 1994. 2/ At the conclusion of the 1994 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors welcomed the continued implementation of Estonia's economic stabilization and reform program, but expressed concern regarding inflation. With the possibility that wage increases might exceed productivity gains, Executive Directors recommended supply-side policies to enhance wage and price flexibility given the exchange rate peg. Estonia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 effective August 15, 1994 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. 2/ Discussions for a new program to be supported by a stand-by arrangement and for the 1995 Article IV consultation were held in Tallinn during January 17 - February 1, 1995. u The Estonian representatives included the Prime Minister, Mr. Tarand; Minister of Finance, Mr. Lipstok; Minister of Economy, Mr. Jiirgenson; Minister for Reforms, Mrs. Hanni; Governor Kallas; and other senior Government and Bank of Estonia officials and representatives from the financial sector. Mr. Bergo, Executive Director, participated in some of the meetings as an observer. The mission established that Estonia met all quantitative performance criteria for end- December 1994. Understandings were also reached, ad referendum, on all u Compliance with the end-March performance criteria (and the completion of the first review) allowed Estonia to make the second purchase under the SBA.

In the Letter of Intent and accompanying Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP) dated February 28, 1995, the Estonian authorities request a fifteen-month stand-by arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 13.95 million (30 percent of quota); JJ in view of Estonia's present balance of payments and reserve position, the authorities have indicated their intention not to make purchases under the arrang,ement. Parliamentary elections were held on March 5. Mr. V&hi, who was Prime Minister at the time the first stand-by arrangement with Estonia was approved, is expected to head a coalition government. No change in the direction of economic policy is anticipated. II. Performance Under the Stand-By Arrangement in 2994 The authorities' macroeconomic goals for 1994 were largely achieved. The recovery in output strengthened, underpinned by rising exports and investment; inflation declined over the course of the year; external trade was redirected toward western markets; and significant progress was made in privatization. Even though inflation was higher than had been anticipated, indications are that Estonian producers remained competitive. All the program's performance criteria were met. 1. Cutput. emplovment. and prices Estonia's economic recovery, which started in the second quarter of 1993, gathered momentum during 1994. After falling by 6 l/2 percent in 1993, real GDP is estimated to have risen 'by 6 percent in 1994. 2J Rapid growth in export volumes and strong investment demand continued to lead the economic upturn. Preliminary data indicated that export volumes, which r'ose by over 40 percent in 1993, grew again by 35 percent in 1994, and total investment is estimated to have increased by over 40 percent in real terms in 1994. Buoyant investment continued to reflect large inflows of foreign direct investment, which amounted to about 10 percent of GDP in 1994, having increased by some 60 percent in U.S. dollar terms (Table 1 and Chart 1). Employment continued to fall in '1994; however, this was more than matched by a decline in the labor force, largely reflecting emigration, and the unemployment rate fell from almost 9 percent in 1993 to 8 percent in u EBS/95/25, 3/l/1995. 2J The newly emerging and faster growing private sector (together with privatized enterprises) is estimated to account for at least one half of GDP, and may not be adequately covered by national statistics. The economic decline may have been overestimated and the pace of the subsequent upturn may have been underestimated as a result.

This was accompanied by a decline in the rate of underemployment from 5 percent to 3 percent, despite a slow pace of labor shedding in large enterprises, including those under privatization. u Despite the continued implementation of stabilization policies, the average monthly inflation rate was about 3 percent in 1994, compared to 2 l/2 percent in 1993. Inflation accelerated to 6 l/2 percent per month in the first quarter of 1994, reflecting the sharp real appreciation of the Russian ruble which raised export and import prices as well as increases in administered prices. Over the remainder of the year, inflation moderated to a monthly rate of 2 l/4 percent. Consumer prices again increased by 3 l/2 percent in January 1995, as utility fees (mainly for electricity and transportation) were raised sharply. Indications are that productivity growth in the tradable goods sector remained high, as robust foreign direct investment coupled with the highly skilled labor force facilitated the transfer of technology and the renewal of obsolete capital stock. Price increases were the lowest in the traded goods sectors. During the last three quarters of 1994, goods prices increased at a monthly rate of less than 1 percent, services excluding items where prices are increased administratively rose by less than 2 percent, and services where prices are increased administratively rose by over 4 percent as the implicit subsidies on electricity and transportation were cut (Chart 2). 2. Fiscal nolicv and developments After recording a small deficit in 1993, the general government's overall fiscal position was broadly in balance in 1994 (Table 2). The financial surplus amounted to 1 percent of GDP, and net lending operations were an equivalent 1 percent of GDP. 2/ Overall, foreign financing amounted to 1 l/4 percent of GDP, and there was an equal increase in deposits with domestic commercial banks. As in previous years, expenditures were cash-rationed, and two supplementary budgets based on revenues in excess of original budget forecasts were approved over the course of the year. Revenue performance was more favorable than envisaged in the 1994 budget. While total revenues did decline --from about 40 percent of GDP to just over 35 percent of GDP--this was less than had been anticipated following the reduction in income tax rates to a flat 26 percent in 1994. VAT receipts rose more strongly than budgeted, mainly reflecting higher imports and improved administration stemming from tighter controls on the registration of enterprises and from the inspection of VAT returns. Nontax u Underemployed workers are those experiencing a reduction in their work hours or placed on paid compulsory leave. u The financial balance is the overall balance excluding net lending, which is financed by external borrowing.

With regard to expenditures, current spending (notably transfers and subsidies) fell by 3 percentage points to 33 percent of GDP, and capital outlays fell sharply (by over 1 percentage point of GDP to about 1 l/4 percent of GDP). Transfers to households (pensions, child support, sickness benefits and compensation for high household living expenses) declined by 1 l/2 percentage points to 9 percent of GDP; the number of recipients increased but the adjustments in benefits did not keep pace with inflation. Net lending (aimed at construction and repairs of infrastructure, and energy sector investment projects) fell about 1 l/4 percentage points to nearly 1 percent of GDP due both to technical difficulties and delays in project implementations. 3. Monetarv develoDments The growth rate of broad money fell sharply from 68 percent in 1993 to 30 percent in 1994 (Table 3 and Chart 3). The decline in the growth rate of base money was more severe as commercial banks sharply reduced their excess reserve levels (by 12 percentage points, to 9 percent of deposits) during the year (Table 4). Reflecting large administered price increases during the year, together with the sharp expansion in money balances in late 1993, real money balances declined in 1994, and preliminary data point to a slight increase in the velocity of broad money. The Bank of Estonia lowered the effective reserve requirement on deposits with commercial banks in July, but this had a limited effect on domestic credit expansion, as the decline in required reserves was matched by a rise in banks' deposits abroad. u While private credit demand was strong-- commercial bank lending to the private sector rose by 73 percent during 1994--the effect on domestic credit was offset by a sizable accumulation of government deposits. Unlike the banking crises of 1992, when several commercial banks were allowed to fail with loss to depositors, the Bank of Estonia lent the Social Bank EEK 231 million in August and September 1994 (equivalent to about 6 percent of base money) to meet large withdrawals, including by the Government. The events surrounding the Social Bank appear not to have significantly weakened depositor confidence in the banking system, as the currency-to-deposit ratio remained unchanged at about 65 percent. u Further, whereas banks charged an increased risk premium in their lending operations with the Social Bank, other interbank lending rates remained in line with the German interbank market. Despite lending to the Social Bank and valuation losses incurred as a result of having official foreign exchange reserves in currencies besides the deutsche mark, currency board liabilities were more than fully covered I/ The Bank of Estonia allowed vault cash to be used for up to one half of the reserve requirement as of July 1994. 2/ The high currency-to-deposit ratio reflects the use of cash for almost all retail transactions, as well as the payment of wages and salaries.

Even so, and despite the indications that Estonian producers are competitive, the rise in inflation in the first quarter of 1994 contributed to rumors of kroon devaluation, prompting the Bank of Estonia to start offering forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities ranging up to seven years to shore up confidence. lJ Even though the proportion of foreign deposits in broad money rose late in the year, this was accompanied by the elimination of the small differential which developed between the Bank of Estonia certificate of deposit rate and the deutsche mark interbank rate. 4. External developments As expected, the external current account balance shifted into deficit in 1994 for the first time since independence, with a deficit of 6 l/2 percent of GDP compared to a surplus of 3/4 percent in 1993 (Table 5 and Chart 4). The recovery in activity and the high share of investment spending (much of it associated with foreign direct investment), contributed to burgeoning imports and a larger trade deficit. Export growth remained buoyant, increasing more than 60 percent in U.S. dollar terms. Estonia's highly liberal trading regime and outward orientation facilitated the reorientation of merchandise trade toward western markets. a Imports plus exports represented 110 percent of GDP in 1994, compared to a world average of approximately 40 percent, but it is possible that Estonian trade data may be somewhat overstated by transit trade. Foreign direct investment dominated the capital account in 1994. Estonia's success in stabilization, advantageous location between western and CIS markets, and low costs are cited as encouraging direct investment, which was mainly from the Nordic countries, Russia, and Germany. Official long term capital inflows were lower than expected, as technical difficulties delayed disbursements of committed loans. 3J The short-term capital account registered a net outflow as highly liquid commercial banks placed their excess funds abroad. Net international reserves grew more slowly in 1994, reflecting the moderate expansion in reserve money demand. 5. Structural reforms The streamlining of the privatization law in 1993 laid the groundwork for a substantial acceleration in the sale of large state enterprises in 1994. By end-1994, a total of 258 such enterprises had been sold, which lJ Beginning in December 1994, the Bank of Estonia limited the sale of forward foreign exchange contracts to three quarters of a domestic commercial bank's assets, less loans from other banks, over the preceding six-month period. 2J The only remaining export quotas (on specialized clay, quartz sand, and gravel) were removed on October 18, 1994. 3J Official debt (including use of Fund credit) remains very low at only US$173 million, or 6 l/2 percent of GDP.

Accordingly, the international tender announced on December 15, 1994 was the last such operation that will be conducted by the Privatization Agency. Almost all small and medium sized enterprises have been privatized at the local level, and about 15 percent of all registered dwellings were privatized during 1994. The use of privatization vouchers was expanded in 1994. Whereas previously all enterprises had been sold for cash only, privatization vouchers could be used for up to 50 percent of the purchase price of some enterprises as of mid-1994. lJ In late 1994, the Government started to offer minority interests in several enterprises against vouchers at public offerings (where the majority interest had been sold to a single "strategic investor"). In addition, almost all dwelling privatizations have involved the use of vouchers by current tenants; vouchers also have started to be used in the purchase of bonds offered by the Compensation Fund. 2J Effective August 1, 1994, free trading of vouchers among Estonian residents was permitted. The restitution process (of real estate) has proceeded slower than expected, largely because of cumbersome administrative procedures and an embryonic system of land and property registration. For this reason, although restitution and compensation claims in respect of about 111,000 properties have been processed (out of a total of 159,105), only about 15,000 properties have actually been restituted (or compensated). III. Policv Issues and the New Program 1. Overall strategy and nrozram objectives The authorities' overall objective is to consolidate the progress toward sustainable growth through a continuation of the macroeconomic policies pursued over the preceding two years. These policies are centered on the currency board arrangement, under which the central bank cannot lend to the Government, and can only lend a very limited amount to commercial banks. The authorities have accordingly constrained the overall fiscal deficits to the availability of external financing. Even though the reduction in inflation remains an important objective, the ability to achieve a specific inflation objective is limited given the absence of monetary independence under the currency board arrangement. In these lJ Privatization vouchers are issued to residents either in relation to number of years worked (National Capital Vouchers) or in compensation for property that could (or would) not be restituted (Compensation Vouchers). These two forms of vouchers can be used interchangeably. 2J The state-owned Compensation Fund receives 50 percent of the net proceeds of the privatization of state and municipal property, and offers its bonds as an investment vehicle for voucher holders.

In the longer term, the rate of increase in domestic wages and nontradables prices will need to be governed by the extent to which labor productivity growth in the tradables sector exceeds the rate of increase in tradables prices. Should wage growth exceed this limit, it would lead to a real exchange rate appreciation and decline in real net exports, which in turn would lead to a contraction in both activity and money. The severity of the adjustment in terms of output and employment will depend on the flexibility of labor and goods markets. Thus, vigilance over wage and other labor market policies, the maintenance of a highly liberal exchange and trade systems, and further structural reforms are important aspects of the authorities' approach. At the same time, fiscal policies should be appropriately restrained, so as not to become an independent source of domestic price pressures. Specific policies for 1995 therefore include fiscal operations which require no domestic financing, and foreign financing directed to investment; strict adherence to the currency board arrangement; the maintenance of a highly liberal exchange and trade system; and further structural reforms. To maintain credibility in the currency board arrangement, besides the prohibition against Bank of Estonia domestic lending, the Bank of Estonia will ensure that its net international reserves remain in excess of currency board liabilities. Real GDP growth is projected at 6 percent in 1995, led by exports and investment, while increases in domestic demand are expected to widen the trade deficit. The inflation rate is projected to average 26 percent in 1995, well above the rate in most trading partners; however, productivity growth in the traded goods sectors is expected to offset the effect of wage increases on competitiveness. With the projected lowering in inflation and in inflationary expectations, the velocity of broad money is forecast to decline slightly. The current account deficit is also projected to fall slightly, reflecting a projected fall in capital goods imports associated with foreign direct investment. While no financing gap is projected for 1995, the Estonian authorities are requesting support from the Fund in the context of a stand-by arrangement in view of the possible need to augment gross reserves. They have accordingly indicated that they do not intend to make purchases under the stand-by arrangement unless conditions should change. The proposed stand-by arrangement establishes as quarterly performance criteria: a floor on the Bank of Estonia's net international reserves net of currency cover; limits on the general government's financial deficit and net lending; limits on official external borrowing; and a floor which the Bank of Estonia will maintain with respect to the reserve requirement on deposits with commercial banks (Table 6). In addition, the Bank of Estonia will maintain the full foreign currency backing of the currency board's liabilities and the Government will not accumulate external payments arrears. Implementation of the program will be assessed during a review carried out no later than November 14, 1995, and performance criteria for end-December 1995 and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - end-March 1996 will be set at that time. A prior action for approval of the arrangement by the Fund's Executive Board is the start of a viable plan for the Social Bank. 2. Labor market and wage nolicies The authorities are aware of the importance of labor market flexibility for maintaining competitiveness and for adjustment under the currency board regime, and are accordingly determined not to intervene in the wage setting process. Enterprises are allowed to freely determine their wages, except for the minimum wage which has played a minor role in wage setting. JJ Given the absence of strong employer organizations and trade unions, wage settlements are likely to be based on firm specific productivity developments. Moreover, labor mobility has been facilitated by low unemployment compensation and a short eligibility period; less than one fifth of the unemployed currently receive unemployment benefits, and benefits are limited to nine monthly payments of less than one twelfth of the current average wage. Finally, in order to further minimize frictional unemployment, the authorities are improving the operation of employment offices, in particular through computerization. Despite the expected upturn in activity, the risk remains that labor shedding of newly privatized enterprises in the medium term may prevent the unemployment rate from falling rapidly.. Another complicating factor is the changing composition of unemployment toward a higher share of structurally, longer-term unemployed. The share of job seekers unemployed for over one year has increased from the beginning of 1993 from one quarter to one third of all unemployed in the beginning of 1994. A potential increase in the number of structurally unemployed points to the need to expand retraining programs; indeed, demand for retraining programs far exceeds available positions. 3. Fiscal policv and social safetv net The Government has formally adopted the concept of balanced budgets, and for 1995, Parliament has again approved a central government budget that aims for a balanced financial position. The approved budgets for the main extrabudgetary funds (the Social Insurance Fund and the Medical Insurance Fund) envisage small surpluses, and the Ministry of Finance projects that local government spending will be more than fully covered by tax revenues and by transfers from the central government. Official estimates therefore point to a financial surplus of about 1 percent of GDP for the general government, with net lending operations envisaged to amount to 1 percent of GDP, and the overall fiscal position of the general government would be balanced. lJ At end-1994, the minimum wage amounted to one fifth of the average wage. The Government plans to keep it unchanged in nominal terms during 1995. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - The authorities project that total revenue of the general government will increase slightly to just over 35 percent of GDP, with significantly higher personal income tax revenue only partly offset by lower corporate income tax revenues. Total expenditure is budgeted to rise to slightly over 34 percent of GDP. Although pensions and public sector wages are to increase in relation to GDP, with Parliament approving a 47 percent increase in government wages for 1995, total current expenditures are projected to fall slightly in relation to GDP. u With the exception of pensions, all current spending categories are expected to decline slightly relative to GDP. Capital expenditure financed from the state budget is to rise considerably because of the need to rehabilitate infrastructure, to be financed largely by external borrowing. During the discussions, the staff expressed the view that in contrast to the cautious nature of budget projections of previous years, official estimates of revenue collections for 1995 appear somewhat optimistic. Specifically, the authorities expected personal income tax collections to increase sharply in 1995- -by 1 l/2 percent of GDP--mainly on the assumption that more vigorous administration would reduce evasion. The staff also questioned whether the envisaged 47 percent increase in government wages was in line with fiscal restraint and the aim of lowering inflation. All in all, the staff thought that on current policies, revenues could be as much as 1 l/2 percent of GDP lower than envisaged, which could imply a financial deficit of l/2 percent of GDP. The authorities acknowledged that their revenue projections could be on the optimistic side. Also, while the wage increase was substantial, public sector wages had become unacceptably low relative to the national average, and that the budgeted increase which would raise them from about 80 percent to 90 percent of the national average was warranted. In any case, should revenues fall short of projections, expenditures would be commensurately reduced as budgets were being implemented on a cash-rationed basis. In that connection, the staff stressed the need to identify the scope for lower expenditures. The authorities noted that there could be some scope to raise excise taxes. Moreover, local tax collections could be higher as local governments could levy income taxes on enterprises up to a rate of 2 percent (as well as a range of other taxes including a local sales tax up to a rate of 1 percent) on the basis of a law enacted in late 1994. The potential for reducing expenditures was more limited, and consisted mainly of delays in the implementation of wage increases. The conduct of fiscal policy is likely to benefit considerably from the formulation of a medium-term framework for budget planning. This will be facilitated by the introduction of a Public Investment Program (PIP), the establishment of a State Treasury in 1995, and from the reunification of the fiscal years of central and local government in 1996. In this connection, u The increase in wages approved by Parliament is not mandatory. So far, wages have been increased by 20 percent as of January 1, 1995.

Budgetary pressures over the medium term are likely to stem from the need to raise social safety net provisions and public sector wages. Government wages are still below those of the private sector, while social security benefits have been close to subsistence levels. For the present at least, government proposals in this area are to finance part of benefits from employee contributions. 4. Monetarv issues As noted above, the cornerstone of monetary policy remains adherence to the principles of the currency board arrangement. While the associated policies, described in the MEP, remain broadly unchanged from those pursued in 1994, several steps are being taken with a view to strengthening the currency board. The Bank of Estonia has indicated its intention to abstain from bank rescue operations similar to that related to the Social Bank, and the program sets a limit on Bank of Estonia liquidity support to commercial banks beyond which Government financial involvement is needed for assistance. A firm basis for close consultation between the Bank of Estonia and the Ministry of Finance has also been established with regard to commercial banking issues. With regard to the Social Bank, specifically, the Bank of Estonia and the Government have agreed to sell or liquidate the Social Bank, and for the Bank of Estonia and the Government not to claim their deposits in the Social Bank; all remaining depositor claims would be honored. I-J The staff expressed serious concern regarding the Bank of Estonia's forward foreign exchange facility, and urged that such operations be ceased as soon as possible. The Bank of Estonia officials thought that these contracts strengthened confidence in the exchange rate peg and currency board arrangement, and that ceasing to offer them would have a negative effect on credibility in the currency board. The staff responded that the resort to such an instrument seems to have done little to allay devaluation rumors in the last months of 1994, and that confidence ultimately depended on macroeconomic policies. The need to resort to such instruments to bolster confidence could, as a result, have the opposite effect should any doubts emerge about policies. The authorities remain firmly committed to maintaining full cover for the currency board. However, they have been active in seeking to take advantage of the higher returns associated with investments in other currencies. To maintain confidence in the currency board, the staff emphasized that at least 100 percent of currency board cover be held in l.J Details of the plan will be described in a supplement to the Staff Report.

The Bank of Estonia aims to strengthen the banking system, with a view to aligning the Estonian financial system with that of the European Union by 2000. Commercial bank supervision is being rapidly strengthened, and prudential ratios and accounting regulations consistent with EU directives are being implemented. The minimum capital requirements for commercial banks is being increased rapidly, which is expected to result in a sharp reduction in the number of commercial banks by 1996. The Bank of Estonia is considering the introduction of universal deposit insurance in line with EU directives. The staff suggested its implementation be made contingent on the accumulation of adequate reserve funds given the expected consolidation of the banking system, including the possibility of further bank failures. It was agreed that any such scheme should be financed solely by contributions from commercial banks, would not involve any official guarantees, and that coverage be limited so as to minimize moral hazard. The Bank of Estonia is also considering a uniform reserve requirement on commercial banks. At present, household demand deposits with the Savings Bank are subject to a 50 percent additional reserve requirement; by end-1994, these deposits comprised slightly more than 10 percent of deposits with commercial banks. While indications are that the additional reserve requirement on deposits with the Savings Bank are not needed for prudential reasons, the staff was concerned about the impact of lowering reserve requirements on liquidity, given that commercial banks in Estonia had limited access to external credit markets. The staff thought that measures to ensure that this did not translate into rapid credit growth should be considered as an expansion in liquidity could affect inflation. Bank of Estonia officials expressed the strong view that there would be little if any effect on domestic liquidity, and that banks were likely to increase their foreign exchange deposits given limited domestic lending opportunities. That said, the authorities are prepared to ensure that additional liquidity would be released only gradually, either through a phased reduction in the requirement or other offsetting measures, even though their intention was not to be involved in liquidity management on an ongoing basis. 5. External develoDments and nolicies The Estonian authorities are committed to a highly liberal trade and payments regime. Few import tariffs remain (on cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and recreational boats), and these are to be replaced by domestic excise taxes in 1995. Moreover, current excise taxes on imported alcoholic beverages and tobacco, which exceed those on domestic products, will be equalized by end-1995. Nevertheless, the Estonian authorities noted that pressure to protect agriculture continues from within Estonia, as well as Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - from the European Union and other Baltic states with the aim of giving their exports an advantage relative to other countries. However, the Estonian authorities remain resolute in their opposition to agricultural protection, since it would reduce overall welfare and place a heavy burden on poorer segments of society, would be contrary to their free-trade philosophy, and could encourage other industries to call for protection. The Estonian authorities remain committed to their goal of strengthening ties with European and global organizations. An association agreement with the European Union is expected to be signed in the coming months to complement the free trade agreement which came into effect on January 1, 1995. The authorities also intend to join the World Trade Organization as soon as possible; to this end, they expect to bind their tariffs at levels equal to those of the European Union. In 1995, Estonia's current account deficit is expected to narrow slightly to 5 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting a moderation of foreign direct investment and associated imports of capital goods. The reorientation of trade away from CIS countries, particularly on the import side, is expected to continue. On the capital account, the inflows of foreign direct investment are expected to decline somewhat from very high levels recorded in 1993 and 1994, partly reflecting increased opportunities in other transforming economies. Net official reserves are projected to grow in line with the demand for reserve money, and gross reserves are expected to average the equivalent of 3.2 months of imports in 1995. 6. Structural reforms The authorities have made significant strides in their privatization program. Enterprises that remain to be privatized represent mainly those which have leased all or part of their production capacity, or have foreign partners --where legal obstacles have slowed down the sales effort--and large utilities and infrastructure enterprises. 'To assist in completing the last stage in the privatization program, the Government in 1994 decentralized the sales effort to include, inter alia, assistance by the EBRD to make ready several large enterprises for privatization. Furthermore, the Government has committed itself to reorganize into stock companies several large utilities, as well as the Estonian Railways, the Port of Tallinn, and the Post Office in preparation for their privatization over the next several years. It has also decided to dispose of enterprises with foreign partners or leases as quickly as possible, even if the prices realized may seem disadvantageous. Regarding housing, in January 1995 the Government asked municipalities to establish early deadlines for the privatization of housing under their control; it is hoped that by end-1995 over 50 percent of all registered dwellings will have been transferred into private ownership. Efforts will continue to be made to accelerate and complete the restitution process as quickly as possible, including transferring the experience of districts with good records of restitution to districts where Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - progress has been slow. The Government will also work to simplify the land registry system to create more streamlined procedures for the registration and sale of property and land. The Government has expressed some concern that vouchers are trading at a substantial discount from their face value. To increase the demand for vouchers, it has reserved a share of selected enterprises for sales against vouchers. In addition, it is hoped that the value of vouchers will be enhanced as land and dwellings that have not been privatized by their residents are made available for voucher sales later in 1995 and 1996. In any case, the authorities are committed to not guarantee the value of vouchers through budgetary or other means. The staff concurs with this approach. IV. Medium-Term Prosnects and Canacitv to Repav the Fund Based on current policies and stable growth of the domestic economy, Estonia's trade volume is projected to expand relative to GDP through the medium term. However, the surge in external trade associated with liberalization, as well as the undervaluation of the kroon, is expected to moderate after 1995. On the assumption that the real exchange rate vis-a-vis the Russian ruble remains near its current level, and other terms of trade shocks do not occur, export volume growth is projected to be 5 per- cent to 6 percent per year over the medium term, with the share of trade with CIS countries increasing slightly toward the end of the period because of Estonia's advantageous position to supply the Russian market. Import volumes are projected to grow faster than GDP, as the share of import- intensive investment, particularly that financed by private and official capital flows, remains high. Under this scenario, the current account deficit is expected to decline from 6 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 to just under 4 percent by 1999 (Table 7). Estonia is expected to remain attractive to foreign capital, with private sources of financing increasingly replacing official lending. Nevertheless, following the surge experienced in 1993-94, foreign direct investment flows are projected to moderate to about 3 percent of GDP by 1999. The share of other private investment, including portfolio investment, is expected to increase as the vehicles for using such inflows and the Estonia capital market both develop. Additional foreign financing is likely to be provided in line with the PIP which is now under discussion, with net flows expected to peak at US$91 million in 1995 and decline thereafter. Estonia maintains a cautious policy on foreign borrowing. On February 23, 1995, Parliament passed a law limiting foreign borrowing by the central government in any year to 15 percent of central government revenues, and the stock of debt to 75 percent of revenues. In line with this policy, total official debt (including use of Fund credit) is projected to amount to just 8 percent of GDP in 1995 and decline in proportion to GDP thereafter. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - Debt service will also remain very low, although a small peak will occur in 2000 as EU/G-24 loans disbursed in 1993 become due. lJ The scenario assumes that Estonia will not make any purchases under the proposed stand-by (in line with their intention); under this assumption, payments to the Fund peak in 1997 at US$23 million, equivalent to 0.9 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services and 0.4 percent of G:DP. If all purchases under the proposed stand-by were completed, payments to the Fund would still peak in 1997 with total payments equal to 1.0 percent of exports and 0.4 percent of GDP (Table 8). In this light, Estonia is not expected to have difficulties in repaying the Fund as scheduled. V. Staff Aooraisal Estonia's stabilization and reform program continues to be successfully implemented, and the Estonian economy recorded several significant achievements during 1994. Output increased for the first time since independence, the inflation rate declined in the latter part of the year, foreign direct investment inflows rose to among the highest in the world o-n a per capita basis, and exports increased sharply while continuing to shift to western European markets. For 1995, the authorities have formulated a program that aims to conscllidate the progress toward sustainable growth accompanied by a further reduction in inflation and a continuation of structural reforms. The main elements of the program are the maintenance of a tight fiscal stance aimed at a balanced financial position, with external financing directed toward investment projects; firm adherence to the principles of the currency board arrangement; the maintenance of a liberal exchange and trade system; financial sector reform; and continuation of structural reforms aimed at strengthening the development of the private sector. The staff believes that the authorities' program will indeed facilitate continued progress toward sustained growth on the basis of market principles. It is expected that the inflation rate in Estonia will exceed western European levels for some time to come. However, Estonia's competitive position would be preserved as long as this is matched by productivity gains in the traded goods sector. The currency b'oard arrangement would imply that the required adjustment would take place without change in the nominal exchange rate should Estonia's exports become uncompetitive. However, unless goods and labor markets are highly flexible, the adjustment process could be lengthy and entail significant costs in output and employment. It will therefore be important that the authorities do not interfere in the setting of prices and wages, so as not to impede the smooth functioning of: these markets. For the present, the staff believes that Estonia's competitiveness in tradabyte goods is still being maintained, and that the real appreciation of the kroon reflects a combination of administered price lJ The medium-term scenario assumes a small buildup in Government short-term holdings abroad in preparation fior this payment. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - increases and high wage increases in line with productivity gains in the traded goods sector. Over the medium term, the staff expects the inflation rate to decline, converging toward western European rates. Estonia's cautious fiscal approach has been one of the focal points of its stabilization effort, and one of the factors underlying the success of the currency board arrangement. For 1995, a balanced state financial budget has again been adopted. However, unlike in previous years, there is a risk that revenues may fall short of budget forecasts. In particular, a substantial rise in personal income tax receipts is assumed in the budget which may not be realized. All in all, the staff believes that on the basis of budgeted expenditures, lower-than-expected revenues could lead to a financial deficit in the order of l/2 percent of GDP. To the extent that revenues fall below projections, it will be important for the Government to take offsetting measures, preferably on the spending side, to enable the budget position to remain in balance. The Ministry of Finance is formulating a medium-term framework for budget planning. This is a very important endeavor, and will help evaluate the longer-term effect of various revenue and expenditure measures. The adoption of a Public Investment Program will be a major step in this regard. A related medium-term issue is government external borrowing. While the staff welcomes the newly introduced limits on central government external borrowing, and external debt levels are expected to remain low by international standards, the staff would note that debt service payments in the future could burden the budget if the returns from the use of these resources fall short of the resulting expansion in debt service obligations. A key aspect of Estonia's stabilization strategy has been adherence to the currency board arrangement, which has been effective in underpinning the rapid decline in inflation. The staff believes that the currency board arrangement continues to be appropriate for Estonia, and supports the implementation of measures which maintain credibility in it. Over the past year, the Bank of Estonia has engaged in activities which, if continued, could undermine the credibility of the arrangement. In particular, the Bank of Estonia lent significant amounts to the Social Bank. The staff therefore welcomes the Bank of Estonia's plan to sell or liquidate the Social Bank, and fully supports the authorities' intention not to be involved in similar rescue operations in the future. The staff also recommends that the Bank of Estonia cease offering forward foreign exchange contracts. The problems with the Social Bank have reaffirmed the importance of banking supervision. The Bank of Estonia has recently started a serious effort to strengthen bank supervision, and the implementation of recent Fund technical assistance recommendations should facilitate this effort. The Fund stands ready to assist the Bank of Estonia in this endeavor, including by providing an advisor in banking supervision. Estonia presently has one of the most liberal foreign trade regimes in the world, with virtually no quantitative restrictions or tariff barriers to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - international commerce. This openness has been one of the principal factors leading to the high levels of foreign direct investment in Estonia. There has recently been some debate, however, on the issue of trade measures to protect agriculture. We believe that imposing tariffs would be costly to the Estonian economy. They encourage inefficient domestic production; raise costs to consumers, particularly to the poorer consumers in the case of agriculture; and discourage efforts to increase productivity. Moreover, their imposition runs contrary to efforts to integrate Estonia in the world economy, and will be hard to remove once they are introduced. The staff thus welcomes the authorities' intention to firmly resist any protectionist measures in this area. Estonia's privatization program has played a key role in the revival of incomes and production, and we support the authorities' planned measures to accelerate the property and land restitution process. The Government is also taking measures to facilitate property registration for the development of mortgage and real estate markets. Over the medium-term, the staff supports the Government's intention to privatize public utilities and to continue with the effort to implement legislation in support of the reform effort. Regarding privatization vouchers, the Government should accept the market valuation for those instruments, and not attempt to support their prices through budgetary operations. The Fund attaches importance to data issues that impede the reliabili,ty of economic analysis. Areas of concern within the national accounts statistics are the adequate measurement of activity in the emerging private sector, consolidated data on general government operations, and measurement of external trade. The staff therefore urges the authorities to work with the Fund's resident statistical advisor to the Baltic states on these issues. In conclusion, the staff believes that Estonia's stabilization efforts continue to be successful. With few exceptions, the authorities have implemented the appropriate policies, and the results on output and inflation have already become apparent. The staff expects that the implementation of these policies would continue, and that the recovery in output which started in 1994 will gather momentum. The staff therefore recommends approval of the stand-by arrangement. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The first Bank study, a country economic memorandum ('CEM) entitled "Estonia - The Transition to a Market Economy", provided a comprehensive overview of the Estonian economy following independence, and was published in March 1993. The study was followed by a series of policy notes that provided advice to the Government on various macroeconomic and structural reform issues. The Bank also prepared a Public Expenditure Review which was discussed with the Government and other donors in May 1994, and published in July 1995. The Review formed the basis for further work on the development and implementation of the Government's Public Investment Program. The first World Bank lending operartion in Estonia, a Rehabilitation Loan for US$30 million, was approved by the Board of Executive Directors of the Bank in October 1992. The loan aimed to support the Government's reform program and to help maintain output in key sectors. The loan closed on September 30, 1994; USS28.6 million equivalent were disbursed and the remainder canceled. A USS38.4 million District Heating Rehabilitation Loan, of which USS3.7 million was disbursed by mid-February 1995, was approved by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors in :May 1994. The main objective of this loan is to increase energy efficiency and improve environmental conditions. In May 1994, a Highway Maintenance Loan (US$12 million) was also approved, with the main objective of preserving the Estonian road network and avoiding costly rehabilitation or reconstruction in the future. The Bank's Board of Executive Directors also approved a US$lO million Financial Institutions Development Loan (FIDL) in October 1994, with the objective to support the Government's implementation of reforms in the enterprise and financial sector. A health project (US$lB million) was approved in January 1995 with the objective of improving the health of the Estonian people through health sector reform. An environment loan which would aim to improve environmental quality in the Hapsalu and Matsalu bays is scheduled to be presented to the Board in April 1995, and an Agriculture and Forestry Project which would support the Government's efforts to promote rural entrepreneurship, private ownership, technical transformation of production systems, and to establish a rural land market is scheduled for appraisal in June 1995.
