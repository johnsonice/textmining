Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Peru, together with the midterm and financing assurances reviews under the third year of the extended arrangement, were conducted in Lima during the period September 11-29, 1995. The Peruvian representatives included the Prime Minister, who is also Minister of Education, the Minister of Economy and Finance, and the President of the Central Reserve Bank. The staff repre- sentatives were Messrs. Duran-Downing (Head-WHD), Cortes (PDR), Kaune (WHD), Schiff (FAD), Terrier, and Valdivia (both WHD). j=/ Following Peru's clearance of its arrears with the Fund on March 18, 1993, the Executive Board lifted the ineligibility status of Peru and approved a three-year extended arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 1,018 million (218.4 percent of quota), of which SDR 621 million corres- ponded to the rights accumulated under the rights accumulation decision. After the first purchase (SDR 642.7 million), Peru has chosen not to make any additional purchases under the extended arrangement. On July 24, 1995, the Executive Board completed the financing assurances reviews through October 1995 and endorsed the economic program for the third year of the extended arrangement. Peru is on the 12-month consultation cycle and the last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 22, 1994. u At the time of the last Article IV consultation, while commending the authorities for the progress that had been accomplished, several Directors observed that the maintenance of a tight fiscal stance was essential to control domestic demand pressures and allow room for growth of the private sector. They emphasized that the maintenance of such a fiscal stance was a key ingredient in the efforts to preserve competitiveness and diversify exports, in the context of strong private capital inflows and pressures on the currency to appreciate. Directors also encouraged the Government to persevere in its efforts to deepen structural reforms. Peru is currently providing adequately the core data to the Fund in terms of periodicity, timeliness, coverage, and quality. In addition, Peru has provided the necessary data for the conduct of the Article IV consulta- tion, and an important improvement was noted in the quality of the data in recent years. 1/ The mission was assisted in the field by the Fund's resident representative in Lima, Mr. De Moraes. During the stay of the mission in Lima an FAD mission headed by Mrs. Casanegra provided assistance in the area of tax administration, and an MAE mission headed by Mr. Guitian reviewed aspects of monetary and foreign exchange management and policies. Mr. Sanson, MAE advisor to the President of the Central Reserve Bank, and Mr. Zamalloa, assistant to the Executive Director, also participated in the discussions. Z?/ Peru formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund Agreement on February 15, 1961.

Backpround Following a three-year period characterized by a decline in output, economic activity in Peru rebounded strongly during 1993-94, while inflation fell markedly (Table 1 and Chart 1). Economic expansion was broad based and real GDP increased by an average of 9.3 percent a year, with strong growth registered in construction, fishing, and manufacturing. Gross domestic investment rose by 5 percentage points of GDP (to 21.5 percent), an increase slightly higher than that registered in national savings. The 12-month rate of inflation dropped from 56.7 percent in December 1992 to 15.4 percent in December 1994. During 1993-94 the external current account deficit widened slightly to about 5 l/2 percent of GDP, as private investment began to recover. Reflecting strong private capital inflows including those related to privatization; the net international reserves of the Central Reserve Bank rose substantially, with gross reserves increasing from the equivalent of about 6 l/2 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services at end-1992 to about 11 months at end-1994. In 1993 and 1994 the fiscal position improved somewhat which, together with large receipts from privatization, enabled the nonfinancial public sector to build sizeable deposits with the domestic banking system. Central government current revenue increased from 11.3 percent of GDP in 1992 to 13 percent in 1994, reflecting a reduction in tax evasion and a broadening of the tax base (Table 2). Higher tax collections and an improvement in the operating balance of the rest of the public sector helped finance a significant increase in public sector capital outlays, particularly for education and infrastructure. The primary surplus of the nonfinancial public sector (excluding privatization'receipts) rose to 0.7 percent of GDP on average during 1993-94, up from 0.3 percent in 1992. Privatization receipts amounted to USSO. billion in 1993 and USS2.2 billion in 1994, with USSO. billion of the cumulative amount spent on social projects. In the monetary area the net domestic assets of the Central Reserve Bank contracted substantially in 1993-94 because of the accumulation of deposits by the nonfinancial public sector as well as stepped up open market operations by the Central Reserve Bank to sterilize the effects of its purchases of foreign exchange in the context of large private capital inflows (Table 3). The ratio of broad money to GDP increased sharply, reflecting in part the remonetization of the economy. During 1993-94 the currency appreciated by 12.3 percent in real effective terms (Chart 2). A comprehensive program of structural reforms was implemented during 1993-94. Legislative changes were enacted in the areas of telecommunica- tions, energy, and fisheries in support of the privatization program. Major concerns in the areas of mining, telecommunications, air transportation, energy, and cement were privatized. As part of the privatization contracts, the new owners were committed to undertaking significant additional investment during the following five-year period. In 1993 the private Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 3 - pension system started operations, and a new banking law and Central Bank charter came into effect; the Central Reserve Bank was recapitalized in 1994. Prudential regulations and bank supervision continued to improve and the capitalization of the banking system was increased. The process of closing official development banks was completed and government activities in this area were limited to the operation of a second-tier institution (COFIDE). The operations of Banco de la Nation were scaled down, its personnel reduced, and its balance sheet restructured. In 1993 Peru cleared its arrears with the Fund and the World Bank and entered in a three-year rescheduling agreement with Paris Club creditors. Progress also was made during 1993-94 toward the normalization of relations with other foreign creditors. 2. Performance under the 1995 program Despite the above-described improvement in performance, pressures started to build'up in the second half of 1994 because of a rapid credit expansion and an acceleration in the pace of public sector expenditure, and these pressures remained strong in early 1995. Against this background the economic program for 1995 was aimed at reducing inflation further to 9-11 percent and narrowing the external current account deficit to 5.1 per- cent of GDP, while strengthening the net international reserves of the Central Reserve Bank. Real GDP growth was projected to decelerate to a more sustainable level (6-7 percent). Although in most areas performance has been moving in line with the program, aggregate expenditure increased more rapidly than envisaged, financed by larger private capital inflows than anticipated. Mainly on the strength of private investment, real GDP grew by 8 percent during January- September 1995 with respect to the same period in 1994. The 12-month rate of inflation declined from 15 l/2 percent in December 1994 to 10.3 percent in October 1995, well within the program range. However, during the first half of 1995 the external current account deficit widened significantly to 7.5 percent of GDP, reflecting higher imports associated mostly with private investment. All performance criteria for end-June 1995 were met with margins, and indications are that those for end-September also have been met (Table 4). The primary balance of the nonfinancial public sector (excluding privatization receipts) registered a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP during January-June 1995, compared with a deficit of 0.4 percent in the program. Reflecting the improvement in the primary balance as well as somewhat lower than programmed interest payments, the overall deficit (before privatization receipts) was below program projections (2.8 percent of GDP compared with 3.6 percent) and there was a further accumulation of deposits with the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 4 - domestic banking system, including from privatization receipts. u Central government current revenue was somewhat below program projections reflecting mainly delays in the implementation of measures to strengthen tax administration in the value-added (VAT), excise, and income taxes. This outturn was more than offset by higher net operating revenues of the public enterprises and autonomous agencies, and lower noninterest spending. Capital outlays were below programmed levels reflecting improved selectivity in the implementation of projects beginning in May, mainly by the Central Government, the housing fund (FONAVI), and the National Development Institute (INADE). During the first semester of 1995 the net domestic assets of the Central Reserve Bank contracted by about 24 percent with respect to currency in circulation at the beginning of the year, compared with 1 percent in the program. This development reflected the stronger fiscal position, larger commercial bank reserve requirement deposits, and larger placements of Central Reserve Bank certificates of deposits. u During the third quarter, the Central Reserve Bank stepped up ,its open market operations in an effort to offset the monetary impact of its net foreign exchange purchases; the outstanding stock of its certificates of deposit doubled to S/. 1.1 billion (equivalent to about 35 percent of base money) at end-September 1995. Interest rates on central bank paper rose from about 15 percent in March to about 18 percent during April-August but declined somewhat beginning in early September. The 12-month rate of growth of credit to the private sector (in real terms) decelerated from about 34 per- cent in December 1994 to 28 l/2 percent in September 1995, but it remains higher than envisaged under the program. The growth of credit was mainly financed by foreign currency deposits and commercial bank borrowing abroad (which increased by about US$730 million and US$530 million, respectively, during January-September 1995). Between December 1994 and August 1995 the new sol depreciated by 2.6 percent in real effective terms reflecting mostly the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies. The external current account deficit in the first semester of 1995 widened to 7.5 percent of GDP, compared with 5.8 percent in the program (Table 5). While exports in U.S. dollar terms were slightly above program projections, imports rose by 51 percent with respect to the first half of 1994, significantly more than envisaged under the program. Most of this growth in imports is accounted for by capital and intermediate goods but consumer goods also have increased rapidly. The growth in imports I/ During January-June 1995 cash proceeds from the sale of public enterprises amounted to US$308 million (compared with a baseline projection of US$209 million), of which US$238 million were spent on social programs, as allowed under the program. 2/ During April-August 1995 the Central Reserve Bank raised the rediscount rate by more than five points, increased the effective reserve requirements of banks by reducing their average period of computation, and tightened regulations to ensure full compliance with the reserve requirements. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 5 - decelerated to 39 l/2 percent in the third quarter of 1995 compared with the same quarter in.1994. With respect to the capital account, public sector net foreign borrowing was broadly as envisaged under the program, but larger than expected private capital inflows have contributed to an accumulation of net international reserves of about US$385 million during January-September 1995, well above the program target. In October 1995 Paris Club creditors activated the third tranche of the 1993 multi-year rescheduling agreement covering maturities through end-March 1996. On October 27, 1995, the authorities announced that an agreement in principle had been reached with the Steering Committee of foreign commercial banks on a Brady-type package. III. Report on the Discussions The authorities were pleased with the recent performance of the economy which, as indicated above, was evolving as envisaged in the program in most areas. For 1995 as a whole, inflation was projected to decline to 9 l/2 percent (toward the lower end of the program objective of 9-11 percent) and output to grow by 7 l/2 percent (compared with 6-7 percent in the program). However, the authorities expressed some concern about the external current account deficit, which was projected to remain at about 7 l/2 percent of GDP (5.1 percent in the program), with higher than anticipated private foreign inflows, and they were keeping developments in this area under close review. The discussions thus focused on the policy options to reduce the external current account deficit and to deal with pressures on the currency to appreciate. 1. Prospects and policies for 1995 and 1996 In the fiscal area the authorities expressed confidence that they would comply with the objective of the program (a primary surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP in 1995), and said that the outturn might be better than programmed. During the remainder of 1995 they would make efforts to preserve the margin that was accumulated earlier under the program, by strengthening tax administration and keeping expenditure under control. They are committed to implementing the recommendations made in September 1995 by an FAD technical assistance mission on tax administration, which included enhanced audits through the program of cross-checking the tax returns of large taxpayers with those of their main suppliers, increased coordination between the tax authority (SUNAT) and Customs, and accelerated reform of the tax courts. In the monetary area the authorities expected the rate of growth of credit to the private sector to continue to decline to 24 l/2 percent (in real terms) by end-December 1995, which would help reduce pressures on domestic expenditure. They noted that the slower pace of economic activity and the rise in domestic interest rates had resulted in a marked slowdown of credit operations in domestic currency. Furthermore, although commercial banks borrowing abroad had remained high, the growth of foreign currency deposits with the domestic banking system had slowed somewhat during the third quarter of 1995. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - The authorities noted that the widening in the external current account deficit had occurred concurrently with a further strengthening in the net international reserves position of the Central Reserve Bank. They believed that this widening reflected in part large investments undertaken by the private sector, particularly in the mining and telecommunications sectors. They viewed the undertaking of such investments, financed in large part by private capital inflows, as essential to Peru's economic development over the medium term. They considered that the increase in the external deficit also reflected with a lag the increase in public sector expenditure and bank credit to the private sector that had taken place in the second half of 1994 and in early 1995. They were confident that actions like the tightening of the fiscal stance since last May and the slowdown in the rate of credit growth would contribute to a deceleration in import growth. The authorities also said that they were monitoring closely developments in this area and they were prepared to take further action if needed. The authorities were in the process of developing the economic program for 1996 and indicated that they intended to request a successor arrangement from the Fund (the present extended arrangement expires in March 1996). A draft budget was sent to Congress in September, based on a rate of real GDP growth of 6 percent and a further reduction in inflation to 8.5 percent in 1996. The staff encouraged the authorities to adopt policies aimed at a more ambitious inflation objective. The staff also cautioned that in 1996 the external environment might not be as favorable as in 1995. On the basis of current WE0 projections, the terms of trade were expected to deteriorate by close to 5 l/2 percent, reflecting lower export prices for mineral products. In the fiscal area, the staff stressed the need for a significant improvement in the primary balance, while making allowance for needed outlays on basic social services and economic infrastructure. The staff noted that this would require a further improvements in tax administration, and cautioned against large wage increases, which would contribute to a deterioration in external competitiveness and affect expectations adversely. The staff also recommended that caution continue to be exercised in spending out of privatization receipts. 2. Dealing with private caoital inflows Peru maintains an open system for current and capital transactions and has attracted significant private capital in recent years, following the adoption in the early 1990s of measures to stabilize the economy and the implementation of wide-ranging structural reforms. Excluding privatization proceeds, private capital inflows have amounted to USS1.5 billion in the first half of 1995, an amount close to that registered for all of 1994 (USS1.8 billion). Part of this increase is explained by foreign direct investment, but there also remains large unidentified flows which are believed to have been in part in the form of medium- and long-term credits extended by suppliers and parent companies to firms operating in Peru. 1/ lJ Detailed data on the composition of private capital inflows is only available with a long lag in Peru. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - Part of the capital inflows is reflected in deposits with the Peruvian banking system and adds to the sources for credit expansion. I/ In an effort to curb credit growth, which as noted, has been above program projec- tions, the Central Reserve Bank has increased the discount rate, tightened the reserve requirements, and significantly stepped up open-market opera- tions since the beginning of this year. As a result, interest rates on Central Reserve Bank certificates of deposits were strongly positive in real terms. The authorities noted that high domestic interest rates tended to reinforce foreign capital inflows and that the increase in the outstanding stock of Central Reserve Bank certificates of deposits would result in the re-emergence of quasi-fiscal losses. They also noted that the marginal reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits with the banking system, set at 45 percent since November 1993, already was high and that imposing a similar requirement on financial intermediaries' borrowing abroad could affect confidence negatively. The staff reiterated that an increase in domestic savings, including through a tightening of the fiscal stance, would help reduce the burden on monetary policy. Moreover, continued strengthening of the prudential regulations and the supervision of banks was needed to deal with the risks associated with the rapid credit expansion. In this regard, the staff welcomed measures implemented earlier this year by the Superintendency of Banks in the form of stepped up requirements for the provisioning of mortgage and consumer loans and mandatory quarterly audits of banks. The staff also urged the Superintendency of Banks to strengthen its risk analysis, particularly for loans extended in foreign currency, and to continue encouraging the capitalization and provisioning of the banking system. The staff cautioned that the adoption of capital controls should only be considered as a last resort. With respect to exchange rate policy, the authorities were facing a dilemma. The strong private capital inflows have put substantial pressure on the currency to appreciate and the authorities have been following a policy to limit this appreciation through sterilized intervention. Although the currency had appreciated in real effective terms in recent years, nontraditional exports have grown at an annual average of 15 percent in the last two years (and 24 percent in the first half of 1995 compared with the same period a year earlier), possibly boosted by increases in productivity resulting from the widespread pacification of the country and the structural reforms implemented since 1990. The authorities felt that letting the currency appreciate would help reduce inflationary pressures further but were concerned that this might lead to an increase in imports, an unwelcome development at a time when the current account deficit had widened significantly. Thus, they were assessing the nature and permanence of lJ About three fourths of commercial bank liabilities to the private sector is denominated in foreign currency, and the proportion of commercial bank credit extended in foreign currency has hovered at about 75-80 percent in recent years; at present it still accounts for 73 l/2 percent of total credit.

Medium-term issues and policies Peru's medium-term outlook remains difficult and the country will need continued extensive support of the international financial community together with strong domestic adjustment to ensure the return to external viability. A continued public sector adjustment effort will be all the more necessary given that private sector demand led by large investment projects, particularly in the mining and energy sectors, is projected to remain strong in the next few years. Peru's external debt service is projected to remain high, and the staff strongly encouraged the authorities to limit their recourse to foreign borrowing and avoid borrowing at nonconcessional terms. 5/ In the discussions the authorities stressed that high external debt service levels would continue to prevail over the medium term and noted that foreign creditors would need to provide Peru with a special treatment on its debt to help create the conditions for growth. The authorities are hopeful that the Brady-type operation can be finalized within a few months and they intend to request financial assistance from the Fund, the World Bank, the IDB, and possibly bilateral creditors to help finance its cost. The authorities indicated that they intended to approach Paris Club official bilateral creditors for a new agreement when the current three-year rescheduling agreement expires in March 1996. The authorities also said that they intended to take steps toward the normalization of financial relations with non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors. The staff has emphasized the need to implement policies to achieve a reduction in the external current account deficit in line with the medium term path presented in the staff report for the third-year program of the extended arrangement (EBS/95/112 of July 10, 1995). A revised medium term scenario including the full impact of the debt reduction operation with commercial banks is to be discussed with the authorities and will be included in the report dealing with the authorities' request to purchase the set asides to finance the debt reduction operation. Achieving sustained economic growth in Peru will require continued implementation and deepening of structural reforms. In this connection, the authorities indicated that they were reactivating their privatization progr=, which they intended to complete by the year 2000. In mid-October the Government sold the Lima electricity generating company (EDEGEL) and 1/ After taking into account the estimated impact of a debt reduction operation with foreign commercial creditors, Peru's external public debt service ratio on an accrual basis would still be equivalent to close to 30 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services during the 1996-98 period. There is relatively little short-term external and domestic public debt outstanding. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - intends to proceed swiftly with the sale of a steel company (Siderperu) and other smaller companies. In 1996 the Government plans to complete the privatization of the state petroleum company Petroperu, part of the electricity company Electroperu, a large mining complex, Centromin, and other smaller concerns. The authorities also are introducing legal changes to strengthen the conditions for economic development. In July 1995 Congress approved a labor law that increases flexibility in the hiring and layoff processes and a land reform law that eliminates restrictions on land tenure and clarifies property rights, thus enabling owners to use their land as collateral for bank credit. A draft law on water rights was recently introduced in Congress, which would set the rules for a water rights market and transfer the maintenance costs of irrigation systems to the private sector. In the area of pensions, a set of reforms was implemented in August 1995 with the aim of facilitating the transfer of workers from the public to the private system by eliminating differences in contribution rates and retirement ages between the public and private pension systems. The Central Government also intends to issue before end-1995 interest-earning securities in order to cover the quasi-fiscal losses of the Central Reserve Bank. The Peruvian authorities are developing a set of second generation structural reforms that would form the basis for balance of payments support loans from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank. Under that program reforms would be undertaken in public health, the social security system, and the regulatory framework. In the area of central government management, a program to establish an integrated computerized system linking the Treasury, Budget Office, Controller, and spending ministries is proceeding, with completion expected in two-three years. In the area of trade policy, the authorities reaffirmed their intention to unify Peru's tariff structure in the near future; at present about 97 percent of imports are subject to the duty rate of 15 percent and the remaining ones to the 25 percent rate. To support the diversification of exports the authorities are developing a set of measures, particularly targeted at small exporters. With regards to regional developments, the authorities noted that progress in the discussions with the Andean Group (GRAN) continued to be hampered by existing disparities in tariff structures and that no significant progress had been recorded toward strengthening ties with the MERCOSUR area. Peru intends to finalize a free trade agreement with Chile in the near future. The authorities noted that the surcharges on agricultural products which had been introduced in 1991 had been reduced to a very low level and reaffirmed their intention of continuing to comply with the timetable agreed upon with the IDB for their reduction. On October 24-25, 1995, the Peruvian authorities presented their economic and social program to the foreign donors community at a Consulta- tive Group meeting held in Paris. They emphasized that efforts to increase the share of public 'social expenditure in relation to GDP would be continued and that a key aspect of the reforms to be undertaken will be the gradual decentralization of social spending. The authorities intend to continue to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - combat extreme poverty through increases in the provision of infrastructure and in the quality of education, health, nutritional levels, and basic justice. With respect to the environment, issues faced by the Peruvian Govern- ment are diverse, ranging from the impact of rapidly growing urban centers to deforestation in the Amazon and the Andes and toxic pollution associated with mining operations. To define a comprehensive policy in this area and promote the preservation of the environment, the Government enacted in December 1994 the law creating a national environmental authority (CONAMA), which is being established since September 1995 with the support of the IDB. 4. Economic data In recent years Peru has used Fund technical assistance in rebuilding its statistical database including in the areas of national accounts, fiscal operations, and monetary operations (Appendix VI). Areas in which the compilation and provision of data are in need of improvement are: the computation of a CPI of national coverage; the updating of the input-output matrix; the fiscal accounts, particularly on the central government expendi- ture side and the operations of the rest of the nonfinancial private sector; labor costs and productivity; and private capital inflows. IV. Staff Appraisal Significant progress has been accomplished in recent years in Peru. Economic growth has resumed, inflation has been reduced significantly, and the net official international reserves position has been strengthened. In 1995 economic growth, while slowing to a more sustainable level than that registered in 1994, remains high. The 12-month rate of inflation has been reduced to about 10 percent and the authorities are confident that it will fall to single digit levels by year-end. The net official international reserves of the Central Reserve Bank have continued to increase on the strength of capital inflows. However, the external current account deficit has widened significantly pointing to the need of raising further domestic savings. In the fiscal area the authorities have tightened public expenditure since the second quarter of 1995, thus helping to ease pressure on resources. They will need to persevere in their efforts during the remainder of 1995 and move ahead energetically in implementing the recom- mendations of the recent FAD technical assistance mission to strengthen the tax administration. In 1996 there will be a need to strengthen fiscal adjustment to help reduce external imbalances and, as noted below, ease the burden on monetary policy. In the recent past a heavy burden has been placed on monetary policy in dealing with strong capital inflows. In this connection, it will be important to strengthen the fiscal stance and at the same time increase flexibility in the management of the exchange rate somewhat to limit the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - undesirable effects of capital inflows. The imposition of capital controls cannot be seen as a practical alternative to these policies. In this regard, credit growth has slowed somewhat in recent months. However, developments in that area will have to be monitored closely and the authori- ties will need to accord increased attention to the status and scope of prudential regulations of banks to preserve and improve the health of the banking system. To this end, commercial banks' borrowing abroad also should be maintained under close review. Because of the strong capital inflows associated with Peru's successful performance, pressures on the Peruvian currency to appreciate have continued. To help preserve competitiveness, public savings should be increased, as noted, and a prudent policy should be kept with respect to wage increases in the public sector also, because of their incidence on the private sector. Of equivalent importance, efforts should be made also to continue improving the efficiency and productivity of the economy through a deepening of structural reforms. In this regard the staff welcomes the reforms approved by Congress in 1995 in the areas of labor regulations, land rights, and the pension system, and encourages the authorities to move decisively to reactivate the privatization process, particularly in the case of Petroperu. Peru's medium term outlook remains fragile, in part because of the high levels of external debt and debt service. Even with strong domestic adjustment the country's external viability could not be attained without the support of substantial debt- and debt-service reduction by commercial creditors and concessional foreign financing. In this regard, the staff welcomes the agreement in principle reached with foreign commercial creditors. This agreement is an important further step toward the normalization of relations with foreign creditors and, in this context, the staff encourages the authorities to take decisive steps toward the normalization of financial relations with remaining non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors. The staff also urges the authorities to limit new borrowing abroad and to avoid having recourse to nonconcessional financing. In view of Peru's performance under the program to date, the staff recommends the completion of this review.

Backpround In March 1993 Peru cleared its arrears with the World Bank, with the help of bridge financing from the United States and Japan, following the Government's successful completion of the Bank's program for countries with protracted arrears. The World Bank has since approved two additional adjustment loans, two complementary technical assistance loans, and lending for the Government's social emergency fund, FONCODES, and in health, education, transportation, and sewage. 2. Obiectives During FY 1995-97 the Bank intends to concentrate its lending and policy dialogue in four main areas: (a) infrastructure development; (b) social sector development; (c) institution building; and (d) macroeconomic sustainability. 3. Lending New World Bank commitments to Peru are projected to average about US$425 million a year during FY 1995-97, conditional upon the continuation of implementation of sound economic policies and further progress in structural reforms. During FY 1995 the Bank has approved loans for Electricity Privatization Adjustment, the Lima Water Rehabilitation Project, and Primary Education. 4.

Outstanding statistical issues a. Real sector The consumer price statistics mission that visited Lima in May 1994 identified methodological problems that overstated inflation prior to 1990. The mission recommended that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) and the National Institute for Statistics and Computing (INEI) work together to prepare a new CPI series for use in deflating the national accounts estimates. The CPI for the 1991-94 period wasrevised in 1995, following the adoption of a new base year but the review of the CPI before 1990 will not be possible due to technical difficulties with the INEI's database. The May 1994 mission also recommended that a national urban CPI be constructed based on information in 25 cities, and possible methods were discussed. However, progress has been slow in this area, and currently the INEI computes CPI indices in six major cities. The INEI is currently revising the national accounts, including an update on the input-output tables to 1992. The project is scheduled for completion by early 1996. b. Government finance , An STA expert visited Lima in 1993 and 1994, to assist the authorities in the compilation of improved fiscal data. The main recommendations of the mission were to exclude some noncash transactions and the operations of the regional governments from the central government data. At the same time, the mission advised including in central government operations the data of the decentralized institutions that were omitted. The 1994 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) includes data reported by the Central Bank of Peru through 1992, and data compiled by the STA mission for 1993, which correspond to the operations of the consolidated central government. During 1995 the Central Reserve Bank reported GFS data on the operations of the general government for 1994, and revisions from 1990. C. Monetary accounts Starting in early 1995, the BCRP has been reporting monetary data to STA on a regular and timely basis. Money and banking statistics in International Financial Statistics (IFS) are updated through July 1995. During the multisector statistical assessment mission to Peru (March 1993), a new method of reporting information for the monetary authorities, the deposit money banks, and other banking institutions was developed.
