Introduction Discussions for the 1995 Article IV Consultation were held in Ljubljana during the period June 6-14, 1995. The staff team L/ met with the Minister of Finance, Governor of the Bank of Slovenia (BOS), the Minister of Economic Relations and Development, the Minister of Industry, the Minister of Labor, officials of various government ministries and agencies, and representatives of the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development, the Bank Association, the Stock Exchange, and exporters. Mr. Kiekens, Executive Director, participated in some discussions. Fund and Bank relations are summarized in Appendices I and II respectively. The last Article IV Consultation was concluded on August 1, 1994 (EBM/94/71). On that occasion, Executive Directors complimented the authorities for the impressive strides made in reducing inflation, increasing foreign exchange reserves, and for the early return to positive GDP growth. Directors, however, stressed the need to rein in aggregate demand through a more cautious-than-budgeted fiscal policy to support the anti-inflationary stance of monetary policy. Given the strong external position and real growth prospects, they recommended a slower rate of crawl for the exchange rate. The authorities were also encouraged to reduce the degree of indexation of wages and financial assets and to accelerate the pace of privatization. Directors emphasized the need to sustain progress towards regularizing creditor relations. Slovenia avails itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2. The exchange system is, however, free of restrictions on making payments for current international transactions. A review of the quality, coverage, and currentness of economic and financial statistics is contained in Appendix III. Core surveillance data are provided on a high frequency basis and with minimal lag. Statistical coverage and quality are on the whole quite good; data on national income accounts are the most problematic statistical area. II. Economic Background Slovenia's economic performance continued to improve during 1994 and the first half of 1995. After first turning positive in 1993, real GDP growth (based on preliminary data) accelerated to 5 l/2 percent in 1994 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Real aggregate demand expansion doubled to 4 l/4 percent in 1994, reflecting sharply higher investment (15 percent) and a revival in exports of goods and nonfactor services, particularly tourism; in contrast private consumption growth slowed, owing to a lower increase in real wages and a rebound in domestic savings rates. Aggregate demand also shifted toward domestically produced goods, spurring output growth and contributing to a widening in the current account surplus. The stronger and more broad-based real GDP growth also produced a bottoming out in the employment shedding that had been experienced since independence in 1991 u The staff team consisted of Messrs. Kincaid, Hewitt, Kalra, Pujol (all EUl), Jiang (EP, EUl) and Ms. Verschoor (ADM). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- :2 - (Chart 2). Moreover, with a 10 percent drop in registered unemployed (December-December), the unemployment rate edged down. Increases in real net wages slowed to 6 percent (annual average) from 16 l/2 percent in 1993. This was mainly due to the adoption of a tax-based incomes policy in May 1994. This policy served as a counterweight to worker-managed enterprises that tend to set wages and employment at too high levels, with adverse consequences for investment and competitiveness. Under this policy, nominal wages were partia;Lly indexed (up to 90 percent) to past quarterly inflation. Enterprise profitability also improved as industrial productivity surged by 11 l/2 percent- -well ahead of real wage increases-- boosted equally by higher output and lower employment. Inflation declined to 18 percent at end-1994 from 23 percent at end-1993, owing entirely to more modest administered price adjustments; monthly core inflation declined only slightly during 1993-94. This stubborn inflation stemmed mainly from the mix of monetary and exchange rate policies, coupled with a highly indexed economy. From 1992 through the first half of 1994, an unstated real exchange rate rule (CPI based) prevailed as the authorities sought to encourage an export-led recovery, but this strategy imparted considerable inflationary inertia in this highly open economy--trade accounted for 110 percent of GDP in 1994. During this period, the authorities sought to bring down inflation by lowering monetary growth, but this anti-inflationary effort met with very limited success. From mid-1994 with the advent of an incomes policy to further anchor external competitiveness, the nominal exchange rate crawl against the deutsche mark was gradually slowed (Chart 3). The immediate consequences were two-fold. One, Slovenia's export competitiveness--measured by relative unit labor costs --diminished by 7 l/2 percent during the second semester. Two, high domestic interest rates, occasioned by tight monetary conditions and backward indexation of financial assets (and still relatively high inflation), increased further uncovered interest differentials (Chart 4), intensifying already sizable capital inflows (that reached 4 l/4 percent of GDP in 1994). r/ The current account surplus rose to US$475 million or equivalent to almost 3 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 compared with a surplus of 1 l/4 percent of GDP in 1993 (Table 2). Exports earnings rose by 12 percent on the strength of a recovery in foreign demancl and a weaker U.S. dollar; imports payments increased in line with exports and thus the trade deficit was virtually unchanged in 1994. The surplus on the net services account lJ About half of these inflows consisted of foreign borrowing by enterprises with affiliated companies abroad as access to private capital markets remained limited pending regularization of creditor relations. The other half related to household transactions recorded through foreign bureaus and could represent misclassified tourism receipts, suggesting a larger current account surplus.

With these sizable current and capital inflows--totalling over 7 l/2 percent of GDP, the increase in net foreign assets of the banking system (in U.S. dollars) in 1994 doubled from that in 1993; gross foreign assets of the banking system rose by USS1.2 billion to USS2.8 billion (4 months of imports). In an effort to keep their monetary program on course, the authorities engaged in massive sterilized intervention--the contribution of net domestic asset expansion to broad money growth virtually ceased (Table 3 and Chart 5). At the same time, broad money growth was lowered to 44 percent in 1994 from 62 percent in 1993. After a string of small fiscal surpluses during 1991-93, the fiscal accounts slipped into a small deficit of l/4 percent of GDP (Table 4). While less than budgeted (1 percent of GDP), this procyclical stance was unnecessary and complicated monetary management. Moreover, the fiscal position shifted abruptly during 1994 from a cumulative surplus of 1 l/4 percent of GDP through three quarters to a deficit of 1 l/2 percent of GDP during the fourth quarter, owing mainly to pension payments. In addition, revenues/expenditures remained about 47 percent of GDP, with the extensive social safety net accounting for nearly half these amounts. Relatively high payroll taxes reduced external competitiveness and continued to encourage expansion of a "grey" economy. Structural reform has gathered speed. Bank rehabilitation was nearing completion. However, currency denomination and maturity mismatches at two large banks --accounting for 40 percent of the assets of the banking system-- have adversely affected their profitability and liquidity, hampering efforts at privatization. As regards enterprise privatizations which were long delayed by domestic debate over the likely beneficiaries of ownership transformation, almost all 1,400 socially-owned enterprises (SOEs), submitted voluntary privatization programs by end-1994. Meanwhile, the Development Fund sold or liquidated about 60 percent of the 98 largest loss- making enterprises under its charge. Overall, enterprises experienced an operating surplus of about 8 percent of GDP in 1994. Partial data for the first half of 1995 indicate new emerging trends. Real GDP growth for the first quarter slowed to 4 l/4 percent from 5 l/4 percent for the comparable period in 1994. Although movements have been irregular, growth in seasonally adjusted industrial production has tapered off (Chart 6). Real GDP growth may thus cool to some 4 l/2 percent for 1995 or somewhat below the authorities' projection of 5 percent. As regards the external accounts, merchandise exports rose by nearly one-third for the period January-May, 1995 compared with the same period in 1994. Nonetheless, the trade deficit widened (by US$200 million) as intermediate- and capital-goods imports rose sharply in line with higher investment and export of goods and non-factor services. The net services account recorded a larger surplus (up by US$125 million) --again owing to tourism--offsetting over half the deterioration in the trade account.

With the impact of the substantial real currency appreciation expected to be felt later in the year, the current account surplus is envisaged to shrink to about 2 percent of GDP. III. Policv Discussions Discussions focused on appropriate policies to achieve sustainable real growth and to consolidate the progress toward nominal convergence with the European Union (EU). As regards the first objective, the authorities continued to follow an export-led growth strategy bolstered by supply-side reforms, l-J h-1 w 1 e anti-inflation efforts were increasingly anchored by exchange rate stability. Notwithstanding the clear achievements obtained by these policies, tensions were evident that could weaken policy resolve. Social friction was on the rise, emanating from distributional conflicts-- across sectors; between 'capital and labor; among income groups; and between retirees and workers. Similar conflicts were an underlying reason for the stop/go policies pursued by the former Yugoslavia. 1. Macroeconomic Policies With robust real GDP growth and a strong external position, the authorities tilted macroeconomic policies toward attaining low inflation by stabilizing the DM/tolar exchange rate. The staff commended the authorities for this policy reorientation and credited this shift with a drop in annualized inflation to single-digit levels in 1995; the exchange rate has remained stable against the deutsche mark during the first seven months of 1995 and annualized inflation fell to 7 percent for this period (Chart 7). The government's inflation target of 10 percent would seem to be within reach, depending on the magnitude of future administered price changes. a. Monetary and exchange rate policies This success in nominal stabilization did not come without some travails, Monetary management was initially complicated by increased capital inflows induced by a higher uncovered interest rate differentials, while a rapid weakening in external competitiveness prompted concerns about prospects for growth and the current account. Discussion centered on the authorities' policy response to these challenges. The authorities stated that sterilization costs in the face of large foreign exchange inflows hLad become excessive; these costs reached 1 percent of GDP in 1994, nearly pushing the BOS into its first deficit. Thus the BOS lJ The underpinnings for this strategy were recently articulated in a government study, "Approaching Europe-- Growth, Competitiveness and Integration--The Strategy for the Economic Development of Slovenia" (see Appendix IV).

Easing of interest rates was reinforced in April 1995 when the BOS's refinancing rates were lowered by 6 percentage points to lo-11 percent. On the advice of a Fund technical assistance mission, the BOS also sought in April, 1995 to enhance nominal interest rate flexibility by deindexing instruments with a maturity below 30 days and lengthening the formula for longer-dated instruments to three months. The virtually universal backward indexation of financial assets during a prolonged disinflationary period had contributed to persistently high domestic rates of return on such assets. The staff welcomed this increased flexibility of interest rates, which is expected to narrow interest differentials more quickly in the future, and the authorities' intention to undertake further deindexation as soon as conditions permit. In reviewing monetary conditions, it was apparent that the sizable capital inflows experienced during 1993-94 were largely absent in 1995. The substantial easing of domestic nominal interest rates, which significantly narrowed the uncovered interest rate differential, was considered the main factor. Both the authorities and the staff were surprised by the responsiveness of private capital flows to uncovered interest rate differentials, particularly given that Slovenia has not yet regularized creditor relations. (Staff analysis to be presented in the background paper confirms a statistically significant positive correlation between capital inflows and uncovered interest rate differentials during the period January 1993-May 1995.) This experience suggests that restrictive monetary policy can indeed induce substantial capital inflows in transitional economies as elsewhere. In mid-February, just past the crest of the capital inflows, the BOS also imposed temporary inward capital controls --borrowers were required to make a non-interest bearing tolar deposit equivalent to 40 percent of foreign loans with less than five year maturity--and raised the existing foreign exchange cover requirement to 100 percent for short-term deposits. While it was difficult to assess quantitatively the contribution of these new capital controls to the subsidence of foreign exchange inflows, the authorities had anecdotal evidence to suggest that the impact was not likely major, but that the controls had extended maturities. u As the situation was still in flux, the authorities stated that they intended to retain these controls for the time being as a precautionary measure. As to the future, the staff counseled that the exchange rate, supplemented by uncovered interest differentials, might be given more weight in assessing monetary conditions. The staff was concerned about a potential tapering off in remonetization and expressed reservations about the predictive power of estimated money demand functions in the new low inflation environment and with an ongoing switch to nominal financial I/ Because borrowings were largely undertaken with affiliated companies abroad, terms were reportedly altered to circumvent this regulation.

Monetary conditions might easily become too loose or too tight if policy judgments focused narrowly on measures of excess money demand. Monetary developments should thus be monitored closely in conjunction with other indicators-- including inter alia wages, activity measures, and imports- -to avoid in particular domestic demand overheating. In this latter regard, moderate sterilization could prove highly useful. The authorities stated that several indicators were indeed watched closely. Some comfort was taken in the recent modest deceleration of broad money expansion and the apparent consistency of recent developments in broad money velocity with its past trends (Chart 8). The BOS has come under attack for its "hard" tolar policy. In the view of some critics, the real exchange rate has appreciated too much and too fast--,20 to 30 percent depending on the measure and timeframe. When confronted with data for January-April 1995 that showed more, and not less, rapid export growth, these critics replied that a lagged response to the past currency appreciation would soon be evident, citing reported sharp weakening in the profitability of some exporters. Slower export expansion would jeopardize real growth and employment owing to the high share of exports in GDP. This scenario appeared to be somewhat exaggerated in light of the consistent current account surpluses, which suggested that some real appreciation had been in order. Given this, some have argued that a nominal appreciation would achieve this correction faster and with lower inflation. Such an approach could, however risk an overshooting of the real exchange rate, which would damage the real sector and BOS credibility. In this connection, the past substantial variation in the current account surpluses made extremely difficult an assessment of the "equilibrium" real exchange rate. Moreover, investment could rise sufficiently in the future with forthcoming privatizations to eliminate the current account surplus without a change in the real exchange rate. With the significant recent real appreciation and the uncertainty regarding the equilibrium level of the real exchange rate, a wait-and-see approach was considered advisable. The Finance Minister, among others, expressed some sympathy for exporters' concerns. As a result, or simply to fend off additional pressures to relax the hard tolar policy, modest rebates on pension and health contributions (equivalent to 0.2 percent of GDP and reportedly consistent with WT.0 obligations), were incorporated into the 1995 budget at a very late stage. The BOS stressed that it would stay the course. Using the nominal exchange rate to regain competitiveness lost through excessive wage awards by exporters--a practice in the former Yugoslavia--would yield an inflationary spiral. More fundamentally, exporters needed to face squarely the implications of rising relative wages rather than attempt to pass those costs on to the rest of the economy through the exchange rate and inflation.

Incomes nolicv Against this background, the authorities considered wage policy to be central to their efforts to temper the erosion of external competitiveness stemming from greater exchange rate stability. After long negotiations with the unions, a modified incomes policy came into effect July 1 or three months after the previous one lapsed. The new policy stipulates an 80 percent backward indexation of wages to inflation in the previous quarter and may imply some paring back of nominal wages awarded during the second quarter. Neither the authorities nor the staff considered the backward indexation formula to be a major hinderance to achieving the inflation target for 1995 because indexation was partial and quarterly inflation was already quite low. The key question was rather the new policy's effectiveness. The authorities expected better adherence to the wage law owing to changes in enforcement procedures. They were prepared, however, to take additional steps to secure compliance if necessary. For the future, the staff recommended that formal wage indexation be terminated once confidence in price/tolar stability is secured. C. Fiscal volicv In'recent years, the authorities have sought to maintain expenditure discipline associated with a roughly balanced budget, while pursuing a medium-term objective to restructure and lower taxes. This strategy has become more difficult with the emergence of deep-rooted structural weakness in the pension and health funds. u The 1995 budget was passed by Parliament in late June. The estimated deficit for the central government plus pension and health-care funds was about l/2 percent of GDP or half the deficit budgeted for 1994. The staff team consider the 1995 budget to be broadly appropriate and welcomed the implied slight tightening of the deficit target. It also encouraged the authorities to achieve some modest overperformance on the envisaged budget as in previous years. The team noted that the cumulative surplus during January-May, 1995 was somewhat lower than in the comparable period in 1994. Greater expenditure restraint would therefore be needed during the second half of 1995 than in 1994 in order to achieve the proper fiscal stance and support monetary policy. In this latter connection, it was recommended that should sustained, sizable capital inflows unexpectedly return, fiscal policy could usefully assume some of the sterilization burden by narrowing the deficit further or engaging in overfunding. The Finance Minister was very concerned by the unbalanced expenditure pattern exhibited in 1994 and its potential recurrence in 1995. He attributed this pattern to the late passage of the 1994 budget and to L/ The net financial balance of the Pension and Health Funds deteriorated steadily from a surplus of 2.1 percent of GDP in 1991 to a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP in 1994.

He added that with improved expenditure control over ministries, the MOF should be better placed to contain late-year spending pressures. The Minister also expressed the intention to submit the 1.996 budget to Parliament before end-1995. Looking beyond 1995, budget prospects look increasingly difficult suggesting that ambitious reforms need to be launched already in 1996. The main challenges stem from EU harmonization and the need to reduce wage taxation. With EU trade integration, customs receipts are projected to decline in stages by 2-3 percent of GDP. Slovenia will also need to replace its present system of sales/turnover taxes with a VAT harmonized at EU levels to reduce international tax distortions. The authorities explained that VAT introduction had been deferred until 1997 pending the strengthening of tax administration and unifying of tax collection authority in the MOF. Accordingly, a draft tax administration law- -establishing a unified tax office --was expected to b'e approved by Parliament during 1995, permitting implementation in 1996. 'To replace foregone custom revenues and to reduce an excessive reliance on wage taxes, the authorities expected to increase taxat:ion of wealth, particularly real estate; to raise progressively certain excises taxes to European levels; and to strengthen auditing to improve compliance by the self-employed and corporate sectors. The staff team supported these efforts and suggested that a VAT could also improve export competitiveness by shifting the tax burden away from the export sector. To achieve the authorities' medium-term fiscal objectives of reducing expenditures and taxes to near EU leve:Ls, reform of the pension and health- care funds would be key. I-.

They hoped, however, to formulate a politically acceptable package in the near future. The staff broadly supported the authorities' thinking, noting that delayed reform would prove more costly. 2. Structural Policies a. External policies Since the break-up of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) and CMEA, Slovenia has sought to establish new trade links and normalize creditor relations as part of its outward-oriented transformation strategy. Slovenia joined the GATT on October 30, 1994, also ratifying the Uruguay Round Agreement. The WI'0 membership agreement was signed in December 1994 and was ratified in June, 1995. The anticipated external impact of the Uruguay Round was considered minor by the authorities as liberal or free trade agreements with the EU, EFTA and the Visegrad countries (which together accounted for nearly three quarters of trade in 1994), were already in place. In June, an EU association agreement was initialed. Slovenia has made substantial progress in untangling the complex legacy associated with the debt owed by the former SFRY. As regards official creditors, the authorities stated that four bilaterals were ready for signature by the Finance Minister and discussions on a further two were nearly completed. The staff team inquired as to the reasons for the relative slow progress in concluding bilaterals. The authorities attributed this to detailed discussions on the amounts to be allocated to Slovenia based on territorial or final beneficiary principles. The authorities explained that they were moving deliberately to assure prompt subsequent Parliamentary action on this politically sensitive issue. On June 8, the authorities reached an agreement in principle with the bank steering committee--the first successor state of the former SFRY to do so. Under this agreement, Slovenia would accept 18 percent of the bank debt of the former SFRY (plus 18 percent of the present value of the past due interest) in contrast to the share represented by the Fund quota key (16.39 percent). Debt held by "connected persons"-- Serbian-related entities as determined either by OFAC or a special arbitrator--would not be allowed' to participate. The final maturity (2006) and interest rate (Libor plus u Among the short-term options under consideration were: increases in retirement age; unification of retirement age for men and women; valorization based on cost of living rather than average wages; a higher penalty for early retirement; and use of a longer work period and broader definition of income in calculating a pensionable base.

Approval by two thirds of creditors and by the Slovenian parliament was envisaged before end-1995. Roughly speaking, Slovenia's bank debt would rise by US$1/2 billion to about US$l billion- -less of course amounts held by connected persons. Even after this deal is concluded, Slovenia's external debt burden over the medium-term would remain relatively low (Table 6) and the increased fiscal interest costs would be minor--less than l/4 percent of GDP in 1996. The staff team once again raised the timing of Slovenia's acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII. The authorities indicated their intention to move to Article VIII status in 1995. Subsequent to the mission, Slovenia communicated to the Fund that it would accept Article VIII status effective September 1, 1995 (EBD/95/112, 8/8/95). b. Privatization and labor market policies Privatization of banks and SOEs is the major unfinished structural reform related to Slovenia's transformation to a predominately private sector economy. As rega:rds banks, the main stumbling block for privatization of the two major banks is their currency denomination and maturity mismatches. Both mismatches stem from the importance of 30-year, DM-linked government rehabilitation bonds in their portfolios. The authorities were, therefore, considering redenominating into tolars a portion of these bonds to help close these banks' presently unprofitable open foreign exchange positions. At the same time, they would undertake an appropriate laddering of maturities. With a view to deepening financial markets, the staff recommended that some new bonds bear ,nominal interest rates, while the remainder could have the possibility that interest rates could be reset later on a nominal basis. Such steps would also go a long way toward developing a secondary market in government securities; creating a domestic yield curve; and establishing a more realistic maturity profile. It was recognized that these advantages needed to be balanced against higher budgetary interest costs and refunding risks. The team proposed that the government (MOF) debt replace BOS bills in order that a single benchmark security emerges to price credit risk and to deepen this market, which is crucial for open market operations. The approval process for the 1,400 privatization programs was well underway with almost half of these programs approved by end-May; the Privatization Agency expected however that this process could slow as more difficult and complex programs were encountered and that it might take until end-1996 to complete the approval process. In any event, about 60 investment funds have been established and capitalized through distribution of vouchers. Thus, the stage is set for mass privatization to commence. While the authorities considered that the slow pace of SOE privatizations had earlier depressed net capital formation, the pick up in investment observed during 1994 was partly attributed to greater certainty concerning the timing of privatization and future ownership. Thus, some of the benefits from the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - privatization effort were already evident. The authorities were, however, concerned that the combination of internal buyouts and investment funds would not provide adequate enterprise governance. In particular, they were worried that most enterprises would effectively remain in the hands of managers/workers--"insiders", implying that management decisions might continue to be biased toward wages and employment. The authorities looked to greater "outsider" and foreign participation to increase tension over income shares for capital and labor and to provide the fresh equity capital and new technology that would facilitate a move from the old labor-intensive activities to capital- and technology-intensive activities that would strengthen the long-term competitiveness of the economy. Weak corporate governance was also viewed by some as an argument for continued government intervention in wage bargaining. While the staff acknowledged the near-term merits of this argument, it warned that national wage agreements tended to enshrine the current wage structure, slowing increases in wage dispersion across sectors and job categories that are needed on efficiency grounds. The cost, however, would be additional income inequality and perhaps greater social tension. Slovenia's ongoing economic transformation, combined with limited wage flexibility and labor mobility, creates the potential for high structural unemployment. To counter this, the authorities were prepared to redouble their retraining efforts; to promote more flexible work practices; to enhance regional mobility; and to narrow existing generous unemployment benefits. IV. Staff Appraisal The Slovenian authorities have continued their exemplary economic management in 1994 and thus far into 1995. The contraction of real GDP experienced at the onset of transition in 1991 has been reversed and a second year of rapid growth is in prospect. At the same time, inflation has retreated from near hyper-inflationary levels in 1991 to near EU levels in 1995. Substantial, albeit uneven, progress in structural reforms'and institution building has been evident. Although the authorities have successfully managed Slovenia's domestic imbalances and transformation challenges to date, they should not rest on their laurels. They are keenly aware of this and have expressed their determination to keep the economy on course. Perhaps the most visible new challenge to this effort stems from the heightened tensions over distributional issues. In the short run, consolidating success in fighting inflation, while sustaining output growth and employment expansion, is the most immediate task. In this connection, the authorities' new nominal framework with its greater emphasis on a stable exchange rate has paid handsome dividends in 1995. This policy shift has lowered seemingly entrenched inflation and made single-digit inflation in 1995 a realistic prospect--for the first time in Slovenia's history. The likelihood of robust real growth and of continued current account surpluses indicate that now is the proper time for such a hard tolar policy. Strict adherence to the new incomes policy would mitigate the impact on external competitiveness. Thus, this policy mix Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 ~ appears consistent with the authorities' broad objectives for inflation and growth. Nevertheless, owing to uncertainties surrounding remonetization, the authorities are encouraged to use several indicators when keeping a careful,watch over monetary expansion. The surge in foreign exchange inflows in 1994 has been effectively addressed through a two-pronged response. One, the stabilization of the nominal exchange rate has brought about a real currency appreciation that is projected to diminish the current account surplus. Two, large capital inflows have eased with the suspension of sterilized intervention and the consequent lowering of domestic nominal interest rates and narrowing of uncovered interest rate differentials. Partial deindexation of financial assets also played a role by reducing persistently high domestic rates of return. The authorities' intention to further deindex financial assets as soon as conditions permit is also supported. While the contribution of inward capital controls is less clear, retaining these new controls temporarily would seem p:rudent in view of the uncertainties associated with capital flows and their maturities, timing of further deindexation of financial assets, and developments in Slovenia's risk premium. Should sizable capital inflows re-emerge, the authorities should also tighten fiscal policy or engage in overfunding. The authorities' prudent fiscal management has been the bedrock of Slovenia's successful stabilization. For 1995, this bedrock remains firm but fissures are forming as a result of needed structural reforms in the budget. These reforms are not technically easy, necessitating new expenditure controls, a revamping of tax administration, a restructuring of indirect taxes to achieve greater harmony with the EU, and requiring a budget neutral reduction in wage taxes, compensated by higher non-wage taxes. Necessary reforms to the pension and health-care systems are, in addition, extremely difficult politically. Nonetheless while this is a multi-year agenda, important steps in each of these areas should be taken already in the 1996 budget. Slovenia's transformiation into a market economy is making substantial progress. Most notably, the long-delayed privatization of SOEs is now poised to take off. The authorities must Twork diligently to quickly complete the privatization process. Attention has appropriately focused on the crucial role to be played by the new owners--insiders, outsiders, and investment funds--in securing proper corporate governance and the capital and technology that are vital to Slovenia's future. Strengthened corporate governance would also obviate the need for long-term government intervention in wage bargaining. Finally, contemplated changes to rehabilitation bonds should permit bank privatization to go ahead and facilitate development of a secondary market in government debt. The complexity of external debt issues associated with the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia has slowed the regularization of creditor relations, postponing Slovenia's integration into international financial markets. Indeed, completion of bilateral agreements with official creditors Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - has taken longer than expected; the authorities should redouble their efforts to reach closure on outstanding issues. Slovenia's agreement in principle with commercial bank creditors-- the first by a successor state to the former Yugoslavia--is most welcome. This agreement, which appropriately balances various concerns, does not pose a major burden on Slovenia's fiscal and external prospects. The staff hopes that quick finalization by all parties will prove possible. Slovenia maintains an exchange system that is free from exchange restrictions on current international transactions. The staff welcomes the authorities' intention to accept the obligations of Article VIII effective on September 1, 1995. It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public'- 14 - Table 1.

Of the three loans that it inherited as a successor to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, only one loan for the Slovene Coast Water Supply and Sanitation Project remains under implementation. Since Slovenia became a member of the Bank in its own right, an Enterprise/Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL) was approved in July 1993. The first tranche of the EFSAL (US$35 million) was fully disbursed in December 1994. Although behind schedule, the overall performance of Slovenia in implementing the program of reforms and achieving its development objectives has been satisfactory, especially as the pace of reforms picked up in recent months. More specifically, the pace of privatization of socially-owned enterprises is generally on track and sustained increases in energy prices have helped to stem the losses in the public service enterprises. The efforts in restructuring Nova Ljubljanska Banka and Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor appear to be also on track. The regulatory framework of the banking sector has been substantially strengthened, including the Government approval of a draft banking law. However, privatization in the banking sector and development of the banking supervision function of the Bank of Slovenia are delayed and very little progress has been achieved in the reform of pensions. The remaining issues and timing for the second tranche release are currently under discussion with the Government. The Investment Recovery Project (IRP), now under preparation, will complement the EFSAL by providing finance for restructuring and new investment of recently privatized enterprises. Given Slovenia's relatively high per capita income and access to credit, Bank operations in the coming three to five years are expected to be few and designed to address selected high priority objectives. In addition to the EFSAL and the IRP, the Bank lending program emphasizes operations in the environment sector. An Environment Project is under preparation, with a focus on expanding the use of natural gas, particularly switching to the use of natural gas in highly polluted areas, and on strengthening environmental institutions in Slovenia-. The phaseout of ozone depleting substances is to be financed by the GEF.

The Statistics Department (STA) has provided technical assistance in the areas of balance of payments and money and banking'dur.ing.FY1993,,"‘ FY1994, and FY1995. The authorities are aware of the .areas ,in,which '_. " statistics need to be strengthened and action plans have‘been', or are being', developed to address these areas.:A multitopic mission from STA.is presently scheduled for September 1995. National income accounts are the most problematic area of major macroeconomic statistics. These,accounts are considered‘acciirate except possibly for the .high inflation.period 1991-92. Value.:,added:has .been .' reclassified according to NACE categories and reconstruction of'historical data has been completed. Value added-for the small-scale private sector may be under-reported as survey techniques are not yet fully developed and tax evasion is prevalent. (One recent study placed the size of the "grey" economy at 10 percent of total GDP in 1994.) Real aggregative and sectoral growth rates (by industrial origin) are reliable, excep.t.'for::the possible' aforementioned underestim,ation. Annual data on the nat'ional..:income .:, ", accounts--nominal, real, ,and various categories--are published in the BOS bulletin; quarterly estimates of aggregate real GDP growth are also presented in the BOS bulletin. Owing largely to staffing constraints, the Statistical Office does not however undertake a decomposition of real aggregate demand by expenditure categories; this task is performed by ;:he Institute for Macroeconomic Analysis and Development and published in a monthly bulletin. The methodology for estimating specific expenditure deflators appear problematic and have led to discrepancies with GDP estimates on the production method. A more complete reconciliation of real external sector magnitudes between the national income accounts and the balance of payments is also required.

Statistical coverage is limited to deposit money banks. Inclusion of savings banks, which do not accept deposits has been recommended, but these has not been given a high priority because these institutions reportedly represent less than 2 percent of total assets of deposit money banks. Economic sectorization generally conforms to international standards. While monetary aggregates are well classified and reliable, the accuracy and consistency of commercial banks' average lending and deposit interest rates needs improvement. An average is calculated based on the lowest and highest rate, rather than a transactions or portfolio weighted average. The time series is also subject to changes in reporting banks. The BOS Bulletin is published monthly and contains timely monetary aggregates, interest rates, and the central bank balance sheet. Balance of payments data are comprehensive and of high quality, conforming in most respects to the methodology of the Fund's Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition. These data are published regularly in great detail and with very little time lag. Nonetheless, efforts are underway to improve the accuracy of classifications. In particular for tourism receipts, the authorities employ an estimation model based on the number of nights spent by foreign travelers and average expenditure; the latter was obtained some years ago. A new expenditure survey was completed in 1994, but the results have not been completely analyzed as yet. This new survey should provided updated estimates of per-night expenditures and is expected to take into account a switch in transactions from in cash payments-- recorded in part at exchange bureaus --to credit cards, which may have led to an underestimation of tourism receipts. In this connection, it was recommended that these bureaus identify the residency of their customers and improve their transaction classification. With regard to data on the balance of payments and on external debt, pending the final determination of obligations to official and commercial creditors, the reported external debt and debt service obligations are tentative. A shift to accrual reporting of debt service payments has also been suggested. The Ministry of Finance complies a broad range of monthly statistics on all major categories of general government operations--i.e., central government, local government, and extrabudgetary social funds. GFS methodology has been employed for some time and these data appear to be of reasonable quality and reliability, and comparable to data in many countries with more advanced statistical systems. These comprehensive data are published monthly and on a timely basis in the MOF Bulletin. The main aggregates appear in IFS. The MOF is in the process of establishing its public debt database to be used in Treasury operations; the authorities intended to make this data available once the system was up and running.

Competitiveness. and Intepration The Stratepv for the Economic DeveloDment of Slovenia , .., ‘8. The above titled document was prepared by the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development based on contributions. This study was under preparation for more than one year before the first draft was published in October, 1994. It was approved by the Government in April 1995. The following briefly summarizes the key objectives, challenges, policy directions, and presents their medium-term macroeconomic scenario. . . ); .:.. . ,... .,,, . . ) ~ ~ .- I. Background and Goals - > :; The report describes Slovenia as a middle income, democratic country in transition to a market economy with private ownership. In addition to transitional challenges, Slovenia--as a small open economy--has had to adjust to the disintegration of its common market with-the .former Yugoslavia and now has to prepare to join the European Union (EU). ,The stated:goals are four fold: (i) to obtain European integration; (ii) to gradually-catch up economically with the developed European countries; (iii) to achieve greater competitiveness of the economy; and (iv) to reach. sustainable economic growth, while preserving national identity, the environment, and social equality. ; ;;: _, : The restructuring of the self-management social&t economy into a ::' market economy was viewed as an important immediate strategic goal. Maj.or". elements of this process include ownership transfer; development of financial and labor markets; a shift from a predominately manufacturing economy to one emphasizing the service sector; and an outward economic orientation designed to foster efficiency and growth., In this later regard, Slovenia's primary strategic goal is its integration into Europe--the,ElJ;. w- EFTA, and the six CEEC that have already signed EU aesociation agreements--. and more broadly with non-European OECD countries. Geography dictated the importance of Europe and Slovenia's desire to become a member of the EU. The EU association agreement (initialled in June, 1995) was seen as crucial because it would iqtroduce over time free trade with a region considered essential for the secure development of Slovenia's small economy. With its initial higher economic development. and ' greater market orientation than the six CEECs, Slovenia was considered to need less than 10 years to adapt to the requirements of the EU association agreement. Subsequently, full integration into the EU would mean acceding to the provisions of the White Paper (December 1993) and meeting the convergence criteria as a prerequisite for joining the European Monetary Union. Of the five EMU convergence criteria, Slovenia.currently fulfills, the two fiscal criteria: the deficit of the public sector is below 3 percent of GDP and the public debt is well below 60 percent of GDP. However owing to the still relatively high inflation in Slovenia, the criteria on inflation, interest rates, and exchange rate were not yet satisfied.

Economic Restructurii A gradual approach has been adopted, recognizing that restructuring costs are not reduced but only deferred or are borne by less influential social groups. A private sector is emerging through privatization of socially-owned enterprises and establFshment of new enterprises. In the initial privatization phase, administrative distribution of shares was undertaken to disperse ownership to insiders and outsiders. In the second phase, ownership concentration is expected to increase enterprise efficiency and lead to a greater capital income relative to wage income. The second phase will commence once privatization shares begin to be traded; relatively low prices are expected to prevail permitting a concentration of ownership. Shares reserved for insider buy-outs should be sold to privatization funds to accelerate the process. Strict supervision of privatization funds is required to assure active ownership. 13therwise Government involvement should be directed towards investment in economic infraseructure, rationalization of the remaining public enterprises, and a partial privatization of government activities. A modem financial system consisting of both money/banking and capital/equity markets was viewed as an essential complement to privatization and a possible source of employment. As regards the money market , .interest rates should increasingly be market-determined and expressed in nominal terms. The spread. between deposits and lending rates should be reduced through greater competition among domestic banks and through the entrance of foreign banks. The state should transfer its major ownership of banks to priv,ate hands. Development of a low cost payments system under proper supervision is also a priority. For the capital market the basic challenge is the rapid emergence of a well-organized market for shares resulting from the privatization process. In this connection, several. key elements were noted such as disclosure requirements for enterprises and investment funds and government regulations to promote investor protection and prevent stock manipulation. To foster long-term savings; .the pay-as-you go social benefit funds should be converted into a well-organized,system with voluntary pension plans and life and health insurance. The major tasks in the labor market are to increase mobility, redefine the roles of unions and management, and assure the continued equality of opportunity. Frictional unemployment would be lowered by inducing more flexibility into the labor market, while structural employment, which is seen as the larger of the two types of unemployment, would require efforts to redistribute educational skills and increase sectoral and regional labor mobility. Frictional unemployment could be lowered by promoting job search and by limiting the extent and duration of unemployment benefits. Structural employment could be enhanced izhrough re-education and training, subsidies for the young and partially disabled, lowering of the tax burden on wages, and encouraging more flexible work rules. A important component of any active employment policy would the reintegration of the grey or informal economy into the formal economy.

Macrostabilization Macroeconomic policy has also opted for a gradual' approach rather than shock therapy. Monetary and exchange rate policies will be focused on the requirements to establish conditions for low inflation.and a stable exchange rate. Consequently, incomes and fiscal policy were viewed as the less constrained macroeconomic policy instruments. In the former Yugoslavia, excessive wage increases redistributed future income to the present via government external borrowing or enterprises' decapitalization/underinvestment. This resulted in a dynamic disequilibrium. Privatization provides the natural enemy--private ownership--to excessive wage increases. During the interim period, incomes policy would be the only safeguard against excessive wages awards. This policy's basic guideline would be to limit real wage gains to productivity growth. Equalization of wag2 increases in industrial, service, and governmental sectors will be abandoned to promote allocative efficiency. As social security contributions are lowered to strengthen international competitiveness, real wage demands should not be permitted to offset these efforts. As regards fiscal policy, the main thrust is to reduce the size of government. Revenues and expenditures should be both lowered by about 4 percentage points of GDP thus maintaining a roughly balanced budget including pension and health funds. On the revenue side, tax collections would need to rise, while social contributions would decline by more. Indirect, profit and property taxes should be increased and their tax bases extended to capture the present "grey" economy. Progressive income tax should be moderate and exemptions reduced, in part, to discourage tax evasion. More property should be taxable and enterprises as well individuals should be liable. The turnover tax should be replaced by the VAT by 1997. Profit taxes are expected to rise only after privatization and with the introduction of tax auditing and accounting standards. With new procedures to reduce tax evasion, revenues would be enhanced. Reductions in social expenditures is envisaged to account for three quarters of the total decline in government spending. In the short run, pension costs could be held down by lengthening the period used to calculate a pensionable base and moving to cost-of-living adjustments for benefits from the present real wage basis. In the long run, employers should provide only minimum obligatory pension insurance; the remainder would be financed by employed persons through voluntary contributions. Health fund expenditures would be controlled by the introduction of additional voluntary health insurance and private health services. IV. Quantitative Scenario Based on consensus projections of the international economic environment and an assessment of the capability of the domestic economy to adjust, two quantitative scenarios were elaborated. The Plus scenario assumes a favorable international environment including fast integration of Slovenia into Europe with Slovenia fulfilling the EU convergence criteria by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - APPENDIX IV the year 2,000. l.J According to this scenario (Table 8), real GDP would grow at 5.5 percent per year on average, labor productivity by 3.5 percent with 2 percent yearly growth of employment by the year 2,000. The present unemployment rate would drop by half from 14.1 percent to 7.5 percent. Real wages increases are in line with productivity growth. Contributions for social security are linked to wages but contribution rates are implicitly assumed to decline. Exports would grow at a yearly rate of over 6 percent exceeding the expansion of demand in :partner countries. Imports, particularly of investment goods, wouLd rise faster than the exports. A gradual reduction of the current account surplus would occur. Investment would revive further and investment in fixed assets would increase from the 17.7 percent of GDP in 1994 to 25.4 percent of GDP in 2,000. Structural reforms would enhance the marginal efficiency of capital to at least that of Spain, Portugal and Ireland. 1/ The second or minus scenario assumes continued political and economic instability in the region, a recession Ln industrial countries, and increasing protectionism. A slower pace of structural reforms is presumed and EU convergence criteria would not be met by the year 2000. Real GDP growth is projected to be lower-- an annual average of 2.8 percent.
