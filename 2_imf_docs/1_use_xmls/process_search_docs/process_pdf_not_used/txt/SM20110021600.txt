Other Reforms to Achieve Sustainable and Inclusive Growth Broader reforms are needed to develop the nonhydrocarbon sector and secure sustainable growth over the longer term.17.      Improving the business climate and governance is key to meeting the government’s objective of increasing the private sector’s share in the economy to 70 percent by 2020. Currently, Turkmenistan lags considerably behind its comparators in the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators rankings and does not participate in international initiatives, such as IMF Standards and Codes, and surveys to help improve governance and the business environment. The authorities’ declared goal is to diversify the economy by fostering nonhydrocarbon sector development and promoting market-oriented reforms. Simplifying registration procedures, improving access to foreign exchange, and facilitating financing for SMEs are appropriate steps to foster the development of the nonhydrocarbon sector and improve governance. A key next step should include participation in the World Bank Doing Business Initiative to help identify priorities to improve the business climate. Developing a dynamic private sector would also entail the restructuring of public sector enterprises and moving away from central planning as the main tool for allocating resources by allowing market forces to determine interest and exchange rates and prices for commodities and services.  18.      Enhancing the framework for managing hydrocarbon resources will improve governance and the oversight of public resource use. Although the authorities have been studying international experience regarding managing hydrocarbon resources, the main reform decisions have yet to be taken. Resource management, including in determining the saving and stabilization roles of the FERF and the SF, should follow best international principles and practices, including the Santiago Principles for Sovereign Wealth Funds and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.  19.      Further exchange rate regime liberalization would facilitate financial intermediation and trade. A new law on foreign exchange regulations—currently in parliament—is expected to ease controls outside the large state enterprises, but further liberalization is needed. In particular, the law would eliminate the requirement of prepayments for exports and imports and allow banks to conduct foreign exchange transactions with nonpublic customers without seeking prior approval from the CBT.   20.      The authorities are interested in enhancing the social safety net, including exploring alternatives to subsidies. The improvement in the UNDP Human Development Index reflects the increasing real per capita social spending in recent years, but more remains to be done (Box 4). The new Ministry of Labor and Social Protection has been empowered to establish adequate labor statistics and improve the social policy and benefits system. The authorities agreed that   Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT TURKMENISTAN      CORRECTED : 8/26/11  12 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  Box 4. Turkmenistan: Social Policy and Subsidies Real per capita social spending has been increasing in recent years contributing to improvements in the UNDP Human Development Index. Since 2007, a new social plan increased spending on education, social security, and heath care. Although the share of social spending in the state budget declined from 67 percent in 2007 to about 50 percent in 2010, real per capita social spending increased by 50 percent in the same period.  Government and SOEs employ 30 percent of the work force. The government wage bill share has declined since 2006 from 6½ to 4 percent of GDP in 2010. The nongovernment sector is mostly in agriculture and retail, which continue to be heavily affected by government policies. The government provides a large and mostly untargeted basket of goods and services at highly subsidized prices. Prices for essential staples, including bread, water, electricity, and gasoline for households, are low even by regional standards. Education is free and medical care, transportation, rents and mortgages for public employees are heavily subsidized. A basic amount of natural gas is free for households, as measuring consumption, especially in rural areas is not enforced.     The cost of implicit energy subsidies is estimated at 20 percent of GDP in 2010. Based on international oil and gas prices, the average ratio of energy subsidies to nonhydrocarbon fiscal balance is estimated to exceed 60 percent in 2010–16.
