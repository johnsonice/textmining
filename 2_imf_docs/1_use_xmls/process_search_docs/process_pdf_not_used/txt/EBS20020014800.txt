Discussions were held in Manila during May 30-June 13. The team met with Finance Secretary Camacho, Budget Secretary Boncodin, Planning Secretary Canlas, central bank Governor Buenaventura and other senior officials; Congressional leaders; academics; representatives from NGOs, trade unions, financial institutions; and with World Bank and Asian Development Bank staff. l The team comprised Josh Felman (Head), 11 Houng Lee, Bas Bakker, Christoph Duenwald (all APD), Barbara Baldwin (MAE), Gabriela Inchauste (FAD), and Inutu Lukonga (PDR). The mission received much help from Sean Nolan (Senior Resident Representative) and from Mr. Guinigundo (OED), who participated in the meetings. . The Philippines’ 33-month stand-by arrangement expired on December 3, 2000, without purchase of the final tranche, mainly because the fiscal deficit went far off track. Outstanding obligations to the Fund at end-June 2002 amounted to SDR 1.5 billion (168 percent of quota), of which SDR 0.3 billion falls due during 2002. . The second post-program Board discussion was held on March 6,2002. Directors urged action to reverse the erosion of tax revenues, including tax administration reforms. They also recommended strengthening the bank regulatory framework, to force banks to deal with their non-performing assets. . The Philippines has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, maintaining an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. It is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle; the previous cycle was concluded on March 1, 2001. . The Philippines is expected to remain under post-program monitoring until September 2003, at which time the outstanding borrowing from the Fund will fall below 100 percent of quota. Accordingly, the next post-program mission is scheduled for October 2002. . The authorities have recently participated in an FSAP and a fiscal ROSC assessment, the conclusions of which are summarized in Sections 1II.B and Box 3 of this report. The Philippines’ statistical base has major weaknesses, notably with respect to the balance of payments and national income accounts; data issues are discussed in Box 3 and Annex V. . The authorities have not yet indicated whether they consent to the publication of this staff report and PIN.

Despite these efforts, the legacy of the Marcos era has proved difficult to overcome, and the economy remains troubled, with the public sector highly indebted and the banking system now impaired. l The new administration has reinvigorated the reform effort. It plans to balance the budget by 2006, clean up the banking system, deregulate the power sector, and rely on commercial financing until the reforms take hold. The favorable initial results of this strategy have won the Philippines increased respect in international capital markets. 0 In recent months, however, policies have slipped. Continued revenue shortfalls have led to large fiscal deficit overruns, and progress on important reform bills has stalled in Congress. So far, financial markets have reacted little to these difficulties, on the assumption that the deviations will be temporary. 0 The task now facing the authorities is to bring their reform program back on track, so as to preserve its credibility. Most critically, they must minimize any deviations from the 2002 fiscal deficit target, by taking administrative measures to halt the decline in revenue, and by cutting expenditure. 0 Over the medium term, further strong measures will be required. To balance the budget, the domestic tax agency will need to be overhauled and the size of the civil service rolled back. To address the problems in the banking system, the prompt corrective action framework needs to be overhauled and the legal framework amended. To boost growth, the electricity sector must be deregulated and pricing depoliticized. Moreover, external commercial borrowing needs to be reduced, to limit the country’s exposure to the vagaries of international capital market sentiment. 0 Implementing these measures will require considerable political will, for the obstacles to fundamental reform are strong-and growing as the 2004 election approaches.

BACKGROUND It is now more than 1.5 years since the reformist government of President Aquino came to power, determined to transform the political system and reinvigorate an ailing economy. Over this period, successive reformist governments, now headed by President Arroyo, have succeeded in restoring a vibrant democracy, but the economy remains troubled, despite considerable assistance from the Fund. Many observers have concluded that the authorities ’ economic strategy has not succeeded, or perhaps not been implemented, especially since the mostpressingproblem remains the same as in 1986~insufficient government revenue. It is worthwhile, then, to take stock and evaluate what has been accomplished, what remains to be done, and whether the authorities ’ current strategy will be sufficient to solve the country’s problems. In short, it is time to look at the Philippines with “a fresh set of eyes I’. A. The Original Asian Crisis Country 1. In February 1986, President Aquino assumed office, on the heels of a “Peoples’ Power” revolution. Her inheritance was an economy in shambles. The Philippines had declared a moratorium on its massive external debt, triggering a cumulative 17 percent collapse in output in the previous two years-one of the largest contractions in modem times. The major corporations were bankrupt, the major banks were failing, and the authorities’ rescue operations were creating a serious public debt problem. 2. Rebuilding the economy was thus a daunting challenge. To do this, President Aquino’s administration decided to abandon the previous development path of monopoly am protection, which had so clearly led to a dead end. Instead, it decided to liberalize and open up the economy. And over the next decade, that is exactly what her administration, and its successors, did. Protectionist walls were dismantled, the economy was opened to foreign investment, key sectors (such as telecommunications) were deregulated, the exchange rate was allowed to float, and capital controls essentially abolished (Box 1). 3. At the same time, the budgetary accounts were gradually straightened out. With technical assistance from the Fund, the authorities erected a sound legislative tax framework and strengthened administration at the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), spurring a steady increase in revenue collection. Over the decade, revenues climbed around 6 percentage points above their pre-crisis levels to reach 19 percent of GNP, gains which flowed straight through to the budgetary balance, since the authorities were keeping a steely grip on expenditures. AS a result, by 1996, the budget deficit had been eliminated and the national government debt reduced by some 30 percentage points to around 50 percent of GNP. 4. These reform efforts paid handsome dividends. Most striking, they succeeded, for the first time in the nation’s history, in creating a strong and modem export sector. When President Marcos resigned, exporting was a tiny activity, earning only $5 billion per year, primarily from coconuts. A decade later, it had grown into a $38 billion business, expanding at around 20 percent per year, in which two-thirds of the earnings came from the electronics Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- sector.’ And as exports began to take off, so did the economy: by the mid- 1990s the Philippines was growing at around 5 percent per year. 5. Even so, the legacy of the past proved difficult to overcome. Most notably, the years of budgetary stringency at a time of rapid population growth took a severe toll on the country’s infrastructure, During the early 199Os, there were serious electricity shortages, which were quickly solved by bringing in the private sector to build new power plants, but at the price of high cost “take or pay” arrangements. Similarly, by the mid- 1990s the Philippines had a smaller paved road network than Malaysia even though its population was more than three times larger. These problems needed to be addressed if the country were to truly take off into growth that would transform the lives of the fifth of the nation living in absolute poverty.2 B. A Second Heart Attack, 1997-2000 6. Notwithstanding the substantial remaining challenges, by 1997 the Philippines’ prospects looked brighter than they had been for a generation. But it was not to be. Initially, it seemed the Asian crisis had little effect on the Philippines, since after a brief pause, growth quickly recovered to near pre-crisis rates, propelled by services and a continuing export boom (Table 1). The solid aggregates, however, disguised serious underlying problems. For the Philippines, despite its different experience in the previous decade, resembled its neighbors in one important way. 7. It, too, was suffering from an asset price collapse, caused when the Asian crisis punctured a credit-led bubble. From 1997 to 2000, the exchange rate fell by around 40 percent, real estate prices by 50 percent, and stock market capitalization by 20 percent of GNP, while interest rates rose sharply. These changes took a severe toll on real estate businesses, as well as on heavy industries which had flourished during the Marcos era, then been weakened by the opening up of the economy, but had nonetheless managed to hold on through the mid-1990s. The median interest coverage ratio of listed companies fell below one, which translated gradually into problems for the banking system. By end-200 1, banks’ nonperforming asset ratio (bad loans plus foreclosed assets as a ratio of total loans and foreclosed assets) had reached 28 percent, compared with just 4 percent in 1996. 8. The problem was compounded by the authorities’ fiscal policy response. Between 1997 and 2000, the government allowed collections to plummet by 4 percentage points of GNP, thereby opening up a similar-sized budget deficit (Table 2). Part of the revenue decline was beyond the government’s control, especially the fall in the critically important financial sector taxes. But much of the lost revenue stemmed from government policies, notably the ’ Gross export figures exaggerate the progress, since value added in electronics exports is only around one-third of the total, but even after correcting for this, the achievement remains substantial. 2 Based on the World Bank’s “dollar-a-day” criterion.

Most damaging, there was a serious deterioration in tax administration under the Estrada administration, which is estimated to have accounted for the bulk of the decline.

C. A New Start 10. In January 2001, 15 years after the first “Peoples’ Power” revolution, President Estrada was driven out by protests against high level government corruption. His replacement was vice-President At-royo, whose government quickly adopted a four-pronged plan to: l address the fiscal problem, by eliminating the budget deficit by 2006, mainly through improvements in tax administration; l clean up the banking system, mainly by shifting the stock of bad loans to private Asset Management Companies (AMCs); a advance the structural reform agenda, notably by privatizing the National Power Corporation (NPC) and deregulating the energy sector; and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- 0 rely on commercial financing, until the reforms take hold. 11. Clearly, the plan focused on the country’s most critical problems. It was also in line with previous Fund recommendations (with the notable exception of the banking sector, where the staff had also been urging stronger action against unsound banks; see below and Annex I). The critical question was-and is-whether the authorities would actually be able to implement the necessary measures. II. RECENTDEVELOPMENTSANDMEDIUM-TERMOUTLOOK A. The Record So Far 12. During its first year, the new administration made significant progress in implementing its agenda. First and foremost, it halted the fiscal deterioration, essentially keeping the deficit to the targeted 4% percent of GNP-the first time since 1997 that the fiscal target had been met. The new government also demonstrated its ability to push through structural reforms, by reviving the energy sector deregulation bill, which had been languishing for the previous seven years, calling Congress into a special session to consider it, and then convincing the legislature to pass it in just one week. 13. These efforts have borne some initial fruit. Despite a very difficult international environment, marked by waves of financial pressure and a sharp fall in electronics exports, the Philippine economy grew by 3% percent last year, one of the highest rates in Asia. In the first half of 2002, growth quickened to around 3% percent, aided by recovering exports, while inflation decelerated to 3 percent, helped by a relatively stable exchange rate. 14. Such results have won the country increased respect in the international financial markets. Early this year, the major credit rating agencies upgraded their outlook to stable from negative. From October 200 1 to mid-May 2002, this growing confidence, together with declining global risk aversion, enabled the Philippines to turn in one of the best performances in international bond markets, with spreads tumbling from a peak of around 700 basis points (as measured by the Philippines EMBI+) in October to around 350 basis points in mid-May. 15. Recently, however, underlying policies have begun to slip. Part of the problem is that maneuvering ahead of the 2004 Presidential elections has already begun, raising the political temperature and distracting attention from reform. Implementation of the power sector reform and passage of the AMC bill have been caught up in these maneuverings, delaying both measures and raising questions about whether the authorities’ aims can be achieved (Annex I). At the same time, fiscal performance has veered away from the programmed path. Revenue collections were far below target during January-June, and remained essentially unchanged compared to their year-ago level-an unusual development at a time of economic growth. Meanwhile, spending raced well ahead of last year’s pace, the result of a conscious decision to front-load expenditures. Consequently, by June the cumulative deficit had reached P 120 billion (authorities’ definition), far above the first-half target, and not far short of the P 130 billion annual target. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- 16. These deviations, together with a deterioration in the global environment, have weakened financial market sentiment. From mid-May, when news of the budget overruns began filtering out, until end-July, spreads on international bonds increased by around 130 basis points (as measured by the Philippines EMBI+), the peso depreciated by 2 percent against a weakening U.S. dollar, and the stock market fell by 17 percent. So far, bond spreads-around 450 basis points at end-July-remain well below their October 2001 peak. But they could rise further, especially if the international environment continues to deteriorate. 17. Even so, the Philippines should be able to withstand a temporary or moderate global shock. One reason is that the bulk of the country’s planned external commercial borrowing for 2002 has already been completed, while international reserves are a comfortable 110 percent of short-term debt, providing a buffer against shocks. Another is that the government’s ability to finance the budget deficit domestically has actually improved, since domestic banks, flush with liquidity and reluctant to lend to the private sector, have increasingly preferred to purchase government bonds. Indeed, despite the recent fiscal overruns, interest rates on the bellwether 9 1 -day treasury bills remain around 4% percent, marginally above their historic low. The Philippines should thus be able ride out any temporary closing of international financial markets, as it did in 2001-provided it is short-lived B. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks 18. The main threat, rather, comes from a potential loss of financial market faith in the country’s medium-term strategy. So far, investors have been impressed by the administration’s achievements during 200 1, and assume that the planned reforms will eventually be implemented, even if there are temporary setbacks along the way. 19. Unfortunately, this favorable Philippines: National Governent Balance li prospect is far from assured. Indeed, ! 2 (In percent of GNP) current trends suggest a starkly different medium-term outlook. Based on first half trends, the budget deficit could reach 4% percent of GNP this year, 1 percentage -’ point more than targeted. Subsequently, a baseline scenario suggests that the deficit -4 could continue to widen to around 5 percent of GNP by 2006, even if the deterioration in revenue collections 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 ~ l/ IMF definition, excludes privatization receipts and includes debt service of the old central bank. somehow ends next year and spending discipline is maintained. This is because interest payments will rise significantly, especially after some of NPC’s debt comes on to the budgetary books, which the staff assumes will occur in 2003 (Table 3). 20. A steady accumulation of large deficits would seriously damage the already- weak fiscal position. Even though this scenario is by no means pessimistic in its macro- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- economic assumptions (with GDP growth, Philippines: Baseline-trend Scenario interest rates, and real exchange rates all 36 --11_ ------_-- __.-,- 550 projected to remain around post-1997 averages), by 2007, the debt-to-revenue 32 Debt/Revenue ratio would climb above 500 percent, while (In percent; - 450 the fiscal debt service ratio would also rise 2g Right scale) significantly. Most ominously, the . government’s gross financing requirement Gross financing _ 350 would grow from less than 20 percent of GNP in 2002 to almost 30 percent of GNP (In percent of GNP) in 2007, a level which could prove difficult 16 - 2501 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 to fund. Such financing difficulties, coupled with a lack of banking or energy reforms, could constrain growth to low levels, insufficient to make a serious dent in the country’s poverty rate. 21. The large fiscal deficits would also undermine the external position. With public sector savings declining and bond issues slowing from 2002’s rapid pace, the overall balance of payments would slip back into deficit. While these deficits would not be large, they would gradually erode the reserve position, reducing the coverage of short-term debt to just 61 percent by end-2007 from 108 percent at end-2002. 22. It is difficult to quantify how investors would respond if they began to expect such a scenario. But past experience in the Philippines suggests that the reaction could be profound, and the economic implications serious. If over the next year interest rates increased to their historical averages plus two standard deviations, while the exchange rate depreciated by 30 percent, and growth ceased (the standard sustainability analysis assumptions), debt service burdens across the economy would increase significantly (Box 2). Corporate interest coverage ratios would plunge, putting further stress on an already-weak banking system. And the fiscal situation would quickly become untenable: in 2003, the deficit would jump to 6 percent of GNP, the debt/revenue ratio to nearly 540 percent, and the fiscal debt service ratio to 85 percent. The result would be macroeconomic instability. 23. By contrast, if the authorities are successful in implementing fundamental reforms, the economy could do reasonably well over the medium term. The main reason is that balancing the budget over the medium term would place the budgetary debt dynamics firmly on a favorable path. By 2007, it would bring the government debt-to-revenue ratio down sharply, to less than 280 percent, while also reducing the fiscal debt service ratio (Table 4).

Growth would remain constrained by a lack of private sector credit, since even if Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- forceful measures are taken, it will take some time to rehabilitate the banking system. Nonetheless, if investment demand recovers, it should still be possible to raise the aggregate growth rate to a sustained and robust 5 percent. And assuming that exports recover even to half their previous pace, external indicators should steadily improve as well. 24. In any case, obligations to the Fund would not be a major concern. To begin with, such obligations are relatively modest, peaking at $590 million in 2003, a mere 4 percent of adjusted gross reserves (Table 5). Moreover, the authorities have traditionally demonstrated a strong commitment to pay, maintaining an unblemished payment record over the years, despite often-difficult circumstances. 111. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 25. The Philippines thus now stands at a crossroads. There is currently a gap between economic trends and market expectations, which can be closed in one of two ways. Either corrective policy actions are taken, thereby preserving the credibility of the government’s medium-term framework. Or, expectations of medium-term prospects will shift, triggering an adverse market reaction. Clearly, the former path is a superior one, but it requires implementing strong and difficult measures, in the fiscal, banking, and energy sectors, as well as on the financing side. Can this really be done, especially in a pre-election environment? This issue was the focus of the discussions with the authorities. A. Can the Budget be Balanced? 26. Perhaps the most important issue relates to the fiscal position. Given the recent budget slippages, the authorities must swiftly reassure investors that the current deviations will prove temporary, and that policies are in train that will solve the fiscal problem over the medium term. In short, they must convince markets that the government can really balance the budget by 2006. 27. This is a formidable task, the staff emphasized. This year’s budget is currently off track. The authorities have already been forced to revise the original medium-term adjustment path in order to reduce the adjustment envisaged for 2003-an indirect acknowledgement that the needed reforms are not yet in place. Perhaps most important, a detailed costing of the adjustment strategy has not yet been undertaken, so it is not clear how the envisaged adjustment will be achieved. 28. Given these circumstances, the most immediate task, the staff team and authorities agreed, was to minimize any deviations from this year’s fiscal target. This required, above all, putting in place measures to stop the revenue decline. This could not be done with tax policy measures, however, since Congressional leaders had made it clear that they would not approve any increases until tax agencies showed they could collect on existing taxes. Accordingly, the immediate measures have focused on tax administration and spending. Specifically, the authorities have stepped up audits, formed a team to investigate errant tax collectors, and drawn up plans to cut expenditure.

The staff team welcomed these measures, but doubted that they would be sufficient to bring the fiscal situation back on track. It urged additional action, in particular to: l demonstrate to taxpayers that there is now a consequence for failing to pay the proper taxes, by prosecuting some of the key tax evaders, while auditing large taxpayers whose monthly payments fall significantly below industry-wide benchmarks. Such “benchmarking” would require reorienting the BIR’s computer system so that flags are raised whenever there is a major discrepancy, as well as changing audit procedures so that once cases are identified, they are examined immediately, rather than waiting until comprehensive audits can be launched, which can sometimes take years; l demonstrate to tax collectors that there is a penalty for diverting funds from the treasury, by establishing an office of internal affairs to prosecute errant tax collectors, establishing an audit committee to ensure that audits are conducted properly, and publishing tax collection data by revenue district, so that offices and agents can be held responsible for their actions; l cut non-interest spending promptly, by around P 15-20 billion (l/2 percent of GNP). 30. Of course, even if the deviation from the 2002 deficit target were minimized, this would be only the beginning of the needed adjustment, the staff team noted. For a start, the consolidated public sector deficit would actually increase this year, mainly because of decisions that will widen the deficit of NPC (See 1II.C below). And correcting the fiscal problem over the medium term would require a large adjustment, amounting to 5 percentage points of GNP to close the gap between the baseline budget and the authorities’ targets. This can only be secured with fundamental reforms, which to preserve confidence in the medium- term framework, should be spelled out now to the public. 31. Most of these measures would need to come on the revenue side, the staff team Philippines: Tax Collection (percent of GNP) and authorities agreed. For revenues are the 18 origin of the fiscal problem: even with the I forceful measures recommended by the team, 16 they are still likely to decline by nearly 1 percentage point this year, bringing the cumulative decline since 1997 to 5 percentage points of GNP. This decline, moreover, would leave revenues at a critically low level, around 14 percent of GNP, far below what is required to finance needed expenditures on poverty alleviation, human development, and infrastructure. 32. Accordingly, over the medium term, revenues would need to be increased by at least 3 percentage points of GNP, the staff team noted. To do this, the authorities have already formulated a BIR transformation program, which aims to bring it up to world-class Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - standards, by making it an autonomous agency, with a new staff and a customer focus. The staff team supported the fundamental objectives of this reform. However, it strongly urged that the sequencing be altered. The BIR should focus first on mastering basic skills (such as audit), before organizing the agency around a customer focus, which requires highly skilled tax officials. Also, the planned personnel overhaul should take place at the outset of the reform (via an Administrative Order) rather than later, after Congress grants the agency Philippines: Required Fiscal Adjustment I/ 2006 (In percent of GNP) independence, especially as the latter may take some time. Moreover, overhauling Baseline Deficit (A) Medium Term Target (B) Adjustment Required (C=B-A) Revenue Measures Tax administration measures Tax policy measures -4.9 0.0 4.9 3.0 1.3 1.7 the personnel now would give the agency a fresh start, reduce the risk of demoralization among those awaiting the personnel changes, and ensure that those receiving training in the new tasks will actually be remaining with BIR. Expenditure Civil service reform Expenditure compression Memo: 1.9 1.7 0.2 Medium Term Target IMF definition -0.3 li Authorities’ definition: excludes debt service of the old central bank, includes privatization. 33. Even if the BIR is reformed successfully, other tax policy measures would still be necessary to rebuild the revenue base, the staff noted. Currently, the government is taking a first step in this direction by seeking legislative approval to restore alcohol and tobacco excises to their 1997 levels in real terms, and index them. The mission warned, however, that if next year’s fiscal targets are to be achieved, implementation of this measure cannot be phased in over 2-3 years, as currently planned. Neither could the largest source of excise revenues-petroleum products, on which taxes are the lowest in the region-continue to be exempted. Nor could the existing income tax holidays, exemptions, and rate preferences be maintained, as they progressively narrow the tax base by excluding the more dynamic sectors from the tax net. Instead, excise taxes should be raised comprehensively and quickly, while specific incentives should be abolished in favor of more general incentives, such as a reduction in the corporate tax rate. In addition, the VAT rate should be increased by 2 percentage points to 12 percent, once administration is improved. 34. Assuming these measures were successfully implemented, another 2 percentage points of GNP adjustment would still need to be found on the expenditure side. Finding this savings would be very difficult, because discretionary noninvestment spending is minimal (just 8 percent of GNP), and there are important basic and infrastructure needs that must be met. In fact, the team stressed, there is only one way to achieve significant expenditure savings: by reducing the size of the civil service. The recent World Bank Public Expenditure Review confirmed that there is some scope for such a reform, as overstaffing exists in a number of areas. And if a bold streamlining were started in 2004, spending could fall nearly 1% percentage points of GNP by 2006, leaving only a reasonable ‘/4 percent of GNP to be found in other cost-cutting measures. But, the staff recognized, political obstacles to this reform are daunting. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- 35. The authorities agreed that fundamental reforms were needed to underpin their medium-term targets. But they warned that this would be difficult in the current political environment. On the tax side, they were planning to eliminate loopholes in automobile and perhaps cell phone taxes, but there was currently no political room to raise petroleum taxes, or to reduce incentives, especially since the Philippines’ needed to remain competitive with its neighbors, which also offered tax holidays. Nor were public prosecutions of delinquent taxpayers feasible, as previous major cases had not succeeded in the courts. 36. Similar constraints prevailed on the spending side. The authorities were aiming to pass a government reorganization bill by the end of the year, then draw up a detailed plan (including severance payments), which would be implemented after the 2004 elections. At the same time, they cautioned that the reform may not materially reduce overall employment, since overstaffing in some areas was balanced by shortages in others. Meanwhile, the government has begun to address problems identified by the recent fiscal ROSC by introducing a new government accounting system, with a modified accrual basis (Box 3). B. Can the Banking Sector be Brought Back to Health? 37. The second critical issue is whether the authorities’ strategy can restore the health of the banking system. The authorities 30 explained that, in their view, the problems were (p Foreclosed assets really concentrated in a small number of banks, which had already changed management and 2. had begun to implement rehabilitation plans. Beyond this, there was a wider problem of non- lo performing assets, but this was manageable, since capital remained above the minimum, while provisions remained generally adequate. This gave banks a cushion, which they could use to sell their impaired assets to AMCs, once this bill was approved by Congress. As these banks cleaned their books of NPAs, and as the economy recovered, the health of the banking system would improve. 38. To assess this strategy, an FSAP was conducted late last year and during the first half of 2002. As detailed in the accompanying FSSA and summarized in Box 4, this study found that the non-performing asset problem is widespread, with most domestic commercial banks having NPA ratios above 20 percent. Moreover, provisioning against these bad assets remains relatively low, amounting to only 30 percent of the face value of assets, suggesting that system-wide capital may be overstated. This problem has caused banks to constrain credit to the private sector, which has stagnated for the past two years (Table 6). And still the problem continues to grow, with the system-wide NPA ratio reaching 29% percent in May (Table 7). 39. Given this situation, the staff team noted, banks will not be able to grow out of their problems. Simulations showed that even if loans began to grow rapidly, interest Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- margins increased, and the rate at which loans turn bad dropped sharply, this would still not be sufficient to restore the profitability of the banking system (Box 5). Nor can banks’ problems be solved by a recovery in real estate prices, since if banks hold on to their repossessed real estate, this overhang will continue to depress the market, while if they do sell, the overhang will clear and prices will eventually recover, but too late for the banks to benefit. Indeed, only an increase in capital would suffice to restore banks’ health. Yet, despite prodding by the central bank, owners have been reluctant to put in their own funds, precisely because returns in banking are so low. Nor have they been willing to sell stakes to those who would be interested in doing so, because the prices of their shares have fallen to a low level, and they do not want to dilute their ownership. 40. This impasse can only be broken, the staff team stressed, if the central bank compels bank owners to come into compliance with the regulations and put in capital, or forfeit their banks. As a first step, the team endorsed the central bank’s plan to strengthen the prompt corrective action framework, so that it would impose well-defined sanctions at a much earlier stage, rather than waiting until banks are demonstrably near insolvency. For example, as soon as a bank’s capital drops below a certain threshold, or NPAs reach a critical level, or it asks for liquidity support, “cease and desist” orders could be issued, compelling the bank to increase capital. Then, if these orders are violated, banks would be taken under conservatorship, or even closed, citing the “unsafe and unsound” provision in the central bank law. 41. This proposed reform could significantly strengthen the central bank’s ability to act pre-emptively. But it would also, almost surely, be challenged in the courts. Accordingly, the team emphasized that to truly solve the banking sector’s problems, a more fundamental reform is needed: the central bank and deposit insurance (PDIC) acts must be amended, to allow supervisors to exercise their existing powers without undue shareholder interference. Two such amendments are particularly important. Supervisory decisions must be made final, as in other countries, with only monetary compensation granted by courts, when necessary. And only institutions and not individuals should be liable to court-imposed penalties for acts performed in good faith in the ordinary course of duty. 42. In addition to these basic reforms, the supervisory agencies should be given the legal authority to implement their powers more effectively. In particular, the PDIC charter should be amended to allow the institution to commence resolution activities immediately, as soon as banks are taken into receivership, rather than being compelled to wait or asked to consider plans proposed by the shareholders-especially since shareholders’ plans are already discussed thoroughly prior to receivership. With this proposed change, the PDIC would be able to sell viable banks quickly, thereby preserving asset values, protecting depositors, and confidence. 43. Even if forbearance ends and owners inject capital, however, the banks would still need to deal with the stock of nonperforming assets. Under the current strategy, banks are being encouraged to sell their NPAs to private AMCs, to be set up once a new law is put in place. But the end-July draft law is insufficient to achieve this objective. It requires NPAs to be sold through public bidding, in which debtors can participate, and allows debtors to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- seek recourse in the courts if they object to the results. It also precludes banks and AMCs from seeking deficiency judgments if, after the sale of NPAs, balances are still due on the original loans. With such a system, debtors may secure “haircuts”, while AMCs may be discouraged from bidding on bank assets. 44. The authorities agreed that banks needed to secure new capital. However, there was little point exerting additional pressure on bank owners, since they were unable, rather than unwilling, to inject further funds. Nor could they take unsound banks under conservatorship until the central bank and PDIC charters had been changed to minimize the risk of lawsuits-and there was little prospect that Congress would approve either measure in the near future, despite the authorities’ best efforts. In any event, the capital needs were much smaller than the staff team believed, since provisioning amounted to nearly 50 percent of nonperforming loans, while little provision needed to be made against repossessed assets, since they were valued at the time of foreclosure, and would soon be reappraised every two years. 45. Nonetheless, the authorities were continuing to do whatever they could. They were encouraging banks to secure Tier 2 capital, with some success so far; and promoting mergers and foreign investment, which should begin to occur as the economy improves. They were also proposing an Asset Securitization Law, which would develop a secondary asset market and enable firms to find alternative sources of capital, beyond the currently- impaired banks. 46. With respect to other banking legislation, the authorities were more sanguine. They remained confident that the undesirable provisions of the AMC bill would be corrected before the bill was finally passed, and emphasized that banks would only be permitted to write losses down over time if they show the total losses immediately and transparently as a footnote to their accounts, and agree to specified supervisory restrictions during the write- down period. On anti-money laundering, they noted that accounts had been frozen in five cases since the new law had been enacted, and investigators were now checking to see if there were cases for prosecution. In addition, they were now considering lowering the threshold for mandatory reporting of transactions (currently at $SO,OOO), as the Financial Action Task Force had indicated this would be necessary for the country to be removed from the noncooperative list. C. Can the Government Implement the 44.2 Foreign Direct Investment Average 1997-2001 Structural Reforms Necessary for Growth? 10.0 47. The third critical question is whether the authorities can put in place the structural reforms needed to lift the 5.0 Philippines’ medium-term growth rate. At present, the main issues center on the electricity industry, where the new reform act 0.0 will privatize the National Power Corporation China Thailand Malaysia Philippines Indonesia and open up the sector to competition.

Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- plan has the potential to attract large foreign inflows, on the back of which other investors might follow, vitalizing foreign direct investment, an area in which the Philippines has lagged behind its neighbors, 48. But the reform will only work, the staff noted, if the government can find a way to balance the needs of investors with the desires of consumers. Investors need to be convinced that they will be able to recover their costs, once they spend large sums to acquire NPC’s assets or build new ones, At the same time, consumers want prices to be reduced, since Philippine electricity charges are among the highest in Asia, the result of power contracts signed when the sector was opened up to private producers in the early 1990s. This divergence of interest presents a serious problem for the government, for if consumers will not accept the prices that producers demand, the budget would be forced to pick up the difference, dealing a serious blow to the already-weak fiscal position-and to the entire deregulation plan. 49. The authorities explained that they have adopted a three-pronged strategy to solve this dilemma. Initially, consumer prices would be lowered, by replacing the purchased power adjustment (PPA) charges with a much lower but longer-lasting universal charge, thereby spreading the public’s payments for the 1990s purchased power contracts over time. Meanwhile, the sector would be opened up to competition, by creating a wholesale electricity spot market and opening access at the retail level, in the hope that this would reduce electricity costs. Finally, pricing would be depoliticized, by transferring decision-making responsibility to a new, independent, and technocratic Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). 50. The staff team (after discussions with i the Asian Development Bank) broadly supported this strategy, but expressed a 1.0 number of concerns. To begin with, it warned that the shift from the PPA to the universal charge, while perhaps revenue-neutral over 0.5 time, would impose a significant initial financing burden on NPC, aggravating the public sector’s already-large external financing requirement. Moreover, the government’s recent 0.0 1 Philippines: NPC Operation andFinancing (In percent of GNP) B NPC deficit l Gross external amortization 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 /I decisions to lower the basic tariff and reduce the l/Does not include the announced reduction of basic tariffand PPA even before the universal charge is / PPA. decided, would damage NPC’s revenue base. As a result, the company’s deficit is likely to reach 1% percent of GNP this year, and its foreign financing need to grow to nearly $2 billion. 1 51. Whether NPC will be able to recover the cost of moving to a universal charge over the medium term will depend critically on whether pricing is depoliticized, the staff team stressed. It urged the authorities to allow the ERC to decide these matters independently, based strictly on their economic merits. Indeed, the ERC is now facing some important decisions, including determining the permitted rate of return for the future Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- transmission concessionaire and the unbundling of tariffs into separate charges for residential and industrial consumers. Technocratic decisions could go a long way toward establishing the credibility of the regulatory process and convincing investors that the Philippines is, indeed, ready for liberalization. 52. The authorities recognized the economic impact of some of their recent decisions, but said that they had been temporary expedients, necessary to draw the heat from political controversy. They remained firmly convinced that once the reforms took hold, and their benefits became apparent to the public, the regulatory framework would operate apolitically and efficiently. Most important in this regard was the introduction of market forces to this sector, for once the public perceived that their prices were the result of competition (rather than “take or pay” contracts), they would come to accept them. Precisely for this reason, as well as budgetary considerations, the government would not provide any more guarantees to investors. 53. More broadly, the main development challenge is to find a way to augment the country’s infrastructure at minimal cost to the public purse. Given the budgetary constraints, previous administrations have been encouraging the private sector to undertake priority projects, but this has required the provision of costly guarantees. These contingent liabilities now need to be brought under control, in the energy and other sectors (such as roads). Accordingly, the staff team recommended creating a centralized risk management unit, which could screen future projects before recommending provision of guarantees. In addition, it proposed bringing the NPC’s borrowing within the overall public sector debt limits, by temporarily raising the limits to accommodate NPC’s obligations, then scheduling a gradual reduction in line with the company’s anticipated repayment schedule. In this way, the fiscal position could be protected against any costly proposals, as the attendant increase in NPC’s financing needs would need to be traded off explicitly against reduced government guarantees for other activities. The authorities responded that they would consider such proposals. 54. Another challenge lies on the trade side, where barriers to agricultural imports remain high. The staff team noted that effective rates of protection in agriculture exceed 20 percent, hampering the development of downstream activities such as food manufacturing, and disproportionately hurting the poor, who spend a large fraction of their income on food. The authorities responded that they would adhere to their WTO commitment to convert restrictions into tariffs, and are planning to allow the private sector to import rice by the first quarter of 2003. They also noted that the average nominal tariff rate will be reduced to 4.7 percent in 2004 from 7.7 percent in 2001. D. HOW Can the Government Minimize the Risks From Commercial Borrowing? 55. The final critical issue relates to the authorities’ commercial borrowing strategy. Since 1997, the Philippines has relied heavily on international capital markets, with public sector (the national government, central bank, and NPC) borrowing reaching $4% billion this year. This borrowing has fueled a rapid rise in debt service obligations, which have nearly doubled since 1997, bringing the external debt service ratio to around 26 percent-and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- considerably higher if adjustment is made for the low value added in electronics (Tables 8 and 9). As noted earlier, this situation entails considerable risks for the country, should investor sentiment change suddenly. 56. The staff team discussed ways to minimize the risk. On the fiscal side, the team recommended shifting, over the next 10 - JMernal Debt Service (In billions of US dollars) 9. d4 2002 2003 few years, toward greater reliance on 41 borrowing from concessional sources, for 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 which there is already a large undisbursed 1 pipeline. It may also be possible to gradually step up reliance on domestic borrowing, since I I1 - 1c r. 9 - 8 Projection _ 7 1 6 5 the large amount of excess liquidity in the banking system should ensure a ready demand for government paper, which for the next few years could be accommodated at relatively low interest rates -assuming fiscal performance returns to its programmed track. 57. Meanwhile, on the central bank side, the team recommended relying more Philippines: BSP Reserves Accumulation and Debt on purchasing foreign exchange than on commercial borrowing. It noted that the central bank has been pursuing a rather unusual funding strategy compared to other central banks in the region. Since the Asian crisis, the central bank has tripled its external debt to $6 billion; since 1999, borrowing has GiEBl Net FX purchase accounted for almost all of the increase in reserves. Such a policy, the team pointed out, carries significant risks. Although the central bank has taken care to spread out maturities, debt service obligations and intervention to support the currency could nonetheless deplete reserves rapidly if markets close, bringing reserves to uncomfortably low levels. In addition, the carrying costs of maintaining borrowed reserves is high, since funds are borrowed at 200- 300 basis points over medium-term U.S. Treasuries and then invested at spread-free interest rates. Moreover, the policy of borrowing keeps the exchange rate stronger than it would if foreign exchange were purchased in the market. 58. A related issue is exchange rate policy. The authorities formally follow a flexible exchange rate policy, in line with their inflation targeting framework. However, they do try to prevent large movements which they see as unrelated to fundamentals, as they did last year, when they kept the exchange rate steady in the face of an adverse shift in market sentiment. While such a strategy proved successful in 2001 in helping to preserve confidence until sentiment turned around, it runs the risk of keeping the exchange rate stable, even though a real depreciation is needed. This may well have occurred last year, when in addition to the swings in sentiment, there may also have been a change in the long-term prospects for electronics exports. The team noted that it is difficult to assess whether this exchange rate Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - policy has, in fact, created a competitiveness problem (Box 6). Nonetheless, it suggested allowing greater flexibility in the exchange rate, as well as an intervention policy that would take advantage of periods of positive sentiment to purchase foreign exchange, thereby raising the ratio of nonborrowed to borrowed reserves. 59. The authorities replied that, in their view, competitiveness remained broadly adequate. The decline in electronics exports was largely cyclical, while remittances (which represented the bulk of earnings) continued to grow rapidly, and there were signs that exports of services, such as call centers, were burgeoning. And while the lack of foreign direct investment was a concern, this would need to be addressed by improving infrastructure, reducing the high cost of power, and strengthening security-not through changes in monetary policy. That having been said, should there be a clear shift in fundamentals, the central bank would allow the exchange rate to move, consistent with their long-standing flexible exchange rate policy. As for increasing purchases and reducing commercial borrowing, such a shift was certainly desirable, but could not be pursued at the expense of weakening the exchange rate. Similarly, stepping up utilization of concessional aid was an objective, but one that required the budget to provide counterpart funds, which were difficult to find in the current fiscal circumstances. 60. The team agreed that the monetary policy stance remained adequate to preserve price stability. Indeed, inflation was likely to remain well below the authorities’ target range of 4%-5l% percent this year and perhaps even next year, depending on the weather and on fiscal performance. During this initial period of inflation targeting, however, it made little sense to change the targets, or to actively try to boost inflation, especially as a low outturn would only boost the credibility of the central bank’s commitment to price stability. At the same time, monetary policy remained under threat from the fiscal deviations; should there be a loss of credibility, market rates would rise and policy rates should follow, to avoid any undue depreciation of the currency, which could jeopardize the bank’s inflation target. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 61. Over the past one and one-half decades, the Philippines has made tremendous policy efforts in order to overcome the legacy of the Marcos era and create a modern, competitive, economy. The economic framework has been radically overhauled: tariffs have been cut to minimal levels, foreign exchange controls almost entirely abandoned, foreign investment barriers dismantled, critical sectors deregulated. In addition, the revenue base was steadily expanded through the mid-1990s, thereby shifting the budget balance from a large deficit into a small surplus. 62. Despite these efforts, the long-standing problems have proved difficult to overcome. Some of the measures adopted, while necessary, have created problems of their own. Budgetary stringency, for example, led to power shortages, and when the private sector was brought in to build new plants, the costs pushed up electricity tariffs to amongst the highest in Asia, damaging industrial competitiveness and generating political controversy. Other measures have not had a durable impact, notably on the revenue side, where collections have recently declined again, opening up renewed deficits and seriously eroding Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- the fundamental fiscal position. Meanwhile, the economy has suffered from an asset boom- and-bust cycle, which has saddled domestic banks with a large and growing nonperforming asset problem. 63. Left unattended, these problems will damage the country’s future. The fiscal deficit will continue to widen, to levels that will be difficult to finance. The public debt indicators will steadily worsen, the banking sector will remain impaired. These circumstances would constrain growth to low levels, and potentially trigger macroeconomic instability. 64. The new administration has reinvigorated the reform effort. It aims to address the fiscal problem, by eliminating the budget deficit by 2006; clean up bank balance sheets, by encouraging banks to sell their nonperforming assets to private AMCs; solve the energy problems, through liberalization and privatization of NPC. Meanwhile, financing will be secured from international capital markets, to tide the country over until the reforms bear fruit. Should this strategy be implemented fully, staff projections suggest that the medium- term outlook would be reasonably bright. The fiscal position should improve significantly and growth should accelerate to robust levels. 65. But implementing this strategy will be a formidable challenge. Much progress has already been made in 2001, when the authorities achieved their budget deficit target for the first time in four years, and secured Congressional passage of a long-awaited bill to liberalize the electricity sector and privatize the National Power Company. This year, however, progress has proved more difficult. Political controversy has delayed the implementation of the power sector reform, while the AMC bill has encountered difficulties in Congress. Most significantly, the budget veered off track in the first half of the year, mainly because revenue has fallen far short of target. 66. The task facing the authorities now, therefore, is to bring their reform program back on track, so as to preserve the credibility of the medium-term framework. So far, financial markets have reacted little to these difficulties, on the assumption that the deviations will prove temporary. In any case, the country has built up buffers against a shift in market sentiment, since the bulk of this year’s external commercial borrowing has already been completed and reserves are well above short-term debt. Nonetheless, the gap between market sentiment and underlying policy realities must ultimately be closed, and this can be done in only one of two ways. Either performance will improve to match expectations, or market expectations will shift, with significant consequences for the economy. 67. The most critical and immediate task, therefore, is to bring the budget back under control. To sustain confidence, the authorities need to minimize any deviations from this year’s target, and demonstrate to markets that policies are in train that will solve the fiscal problem over the medium term, Most importantly, convincing measures are needed to halt, and reverse, the revenue decline. This requires convincing taxpayers that there is a penalty for not paying taxes, and convincing tax collectors that there is a cost for diverting funds from the treasury. Already, the government has taken steps in this direction, including stepping up audits and establishing a team to investigate errant tax collectors, But more needs Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - to be done, in the staffs view. Perhaps the most direct way of sending a signal of the government’s seriousness would be to prosecute some of the biggest tax evaders. In addition, the government should audit and fine (if necessary) large taxpayers whose monthly payments fall significantly below industry-wide benchmarks. 68. Over the medium term, additional strong measures will be required. A thorough overhaul of the Bureau of Internal Revenue is essential, and the authorities are currently commencing one. However, the reform needs to focus on getting the organization to master basic tasks (such as auditing), rather than more advanced procedures (such as shifting to a customer focus). Moreover, the staff recommends altering the sequencing, so that personnel changes take place first, before the other reforms, to give the organization a fresh start and to prevent demoralization among staff worried about losing their positions. Also critical is action on the expenditure side. In particular, the size of the civil service must be rolled back significantly, starting in 2004, to free up the resources needed to balance the budget while still meeting the authorities’ social and poverty alleviation spending objectives. 69. The banking system needs to be strengthened. The recent FSAP has found that nonperforming assets have seriously impaired the health of the banking system, eroding capital adequacy and constraining credit to the private sector, which has been stagnating for the past two years. Indeed, the problem has now become so large that banks can no longer grow out of it; instead, supervisors need to compel bank owners to inject capital. But before this can be done, the supervisory framework needs to be strengthened. As a first step, the prompt corrective action framework should be improved, so that sanctions are imposed on problem banks at an early stage, such as when their NPAs reach a critical level, or they ask for liquidity support. Moreover, to ensure that these sanctions are credible, the central bank charter should be amended, to ensure that supervisory decisions are final, and supervisors are immune from lawsuits for actions performed in the ordinary course of duty. The PDIC charter should also be amended, to allow it to resolve closed banks quickly, without having to wait for new proposals from owners. Finally, the draft AMC bill needs to be strengthened, to ensure that debtors cannot block loan sales, or effectively buy back their loans at a discount from banks. All of these measures are currently planned by the authorities, and all are strongly endorsed by the staff. But all face uncertain prospects in Congress. 70. Further structural reforms are needed for growth. The planned electricity reform holds out the promise of solving the long-standing power sector problem, while spurring large amounts of foreign direct investment. But this reform will only succeed if the authorities are able to find a way to balance the needs of investors to recoup their investments with the desire of the public for lower prices. So far, this balance has proved elusive: the price difference has been picked up by the public sector, with recent decisions only increasing the deficits and financing burden for the NPC. The staff urges the authorities, therefore, to depoliticize the issue, by allowing the new ERC to take regulatory and pricing decisions, strictly on their economic merits. Given past experience, it would also be important to limit the provision of further guarantees, in the energy and other sectors, and to bring NPC’s obligations into the overall public sector external debt limits. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - 71. The risks from external commercial borrowing need to be limited. Over the past several years, public external commercial borrowing has grown rapidly, swelling the external debt service ratio, and increasing the country’s exposure to the vagaries of international capital market sentiment. To minimize the risks this entails, the staff suggests placing greater reliance on concessional borrowing, where there is a large undisbursed pipeline, and domestic borrowing, where private sector repayment problems have encouraged a growing demand for government paper. The staff also recommends that the central bank gradually rely more on purchasing foreign exchange than commercial borrowing to build up its reserves. 72. As for monetary policy, the staff commends the central bank for steering a careful course, allowing interest rates to fall to stimulate the economy, while keeping inflation firmly under control. It notes, however, that the key to maintaining this fine balance will be ensuring that the fiscal situation quickly returns to the programmed path. In addition, the exchange rate should remain flexible, so that it can respond to any fundamental changes in the country’s competitiveness. 73. The staff also welcomes the authorities’ efforts to remedy the statistical problems hampering analysis. The interagency balance of payments task force, in particular, has already made significant progress, holding out the prospect that this major statistical problem could be addressed by the end of the year. 74. In sum, the challenges ahead are formidable. The reforms needed are substantial, the political obstacles daunting. Many of these measures, such as civil service reform, have been considered repeatedly, and rejected each time on the grounds that they were politically too difficult. And the environment for reform is becoming more difficult now, with the 2004 elections approaching. But the longer-term track record of the country gives grounds for optimism: over the past decade and one-half, much has been accomplished, even measures previously thought impossible. 75. The Philippines has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, maintaining an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Philippines be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

VULNERABILITIES OF THE PHILIPPINE ECONOMY The Philippines’ outlook is subject to considerable vulnerabilities: . The medium-term budget deficit targets will be difficult to achieve. The authorities’ strategy calls for the budget to be balanced by 2006, mainly by reducing expenditure by 3 percentage points of GNP. Yet the measures to underpin this adjustment are not yet in place. . The banking system continues to weaken. NPAs have now reached 11 percent of GNP, and look set to climb further. Yet the supervisors have inadequate authority to handle banking problems. . External financing requirements are sizable, and the export outlook uncertain. While this year’s external financing requirements have largely been met, further large commercial borrowings and foreign exchange earnings will be needed in the years ahead to meet the country’s $10 billion in annual debt service obligations. But Philippines’ exports have been hit hard by the global slump in electronics, and it is difficult to predict how strong a recovery in this sector will be. This situation creates risks for the country. For if fiscal performance slips, a major bank encounters liquidity difficulty, exports or global capital markets weaken again, confidence in the Philippines-so carefully built up over the past year-could give way, undermining the economy. Such a loss in confidence could trigger higher interest rates, exchange rate depreciation, and a recession. A sensitivity analysis suggests that if domestic and foreign interest rates increase by two standard deviations above the average of the past seven years, the exchange rate depreciates by 30 percent, and GNP growth ceases:” . The public debt-to-GNP ratio would increase by around 20 percentage points. The biggest contribution would come from the exchange rate shock, as this would push up the external debt in peso terms. There would also Philippines: Vulnerability to Shocks be a significant impact from (Percentage point deviation from baseline, except where indicated) 2002 2003 2004 GNP. mainlv because a two- 2005 2006 2007 Baseline Public debt-GNP ratio Ii 90.2 86.7 86.7 86.7 86.6 86.5 . standard deviation shock would bring growth down to zero, causing revenue to stagnate even as interest expenditures were increasing.

Meanwhile, higher interest payments would add to the debt stock, especially if they are entirely debt financed. Of course, these shocks would also have a major impact on the current account, which initially would improve by about 3 percent of GNP, before gradually returning to trend over the medium term. The additional current account inflows would gradually reduce the debt stock, but even so, by 2007, the debt/GNP ratio would remain around 18 percentage points higher than in the baseline. . Nonperforming assets would rise substantially. An increase in interest rates, an output collapse, or a large depreciation of the peso would put considerable pressure on the corporate sector and hence the banking system, leading to a further rise in NPAs. This would result in a significant erosion in capital, even at current provisioning rates. Worse still, if NPAs were in addition assumed to be provisioned for by 50 percent instead of 28 percent currently, the average CAR would drop below the 10 percent regulatory minimum. l/ The sensitivity analysis is based on the framework set out in “Assessing Sustainability” (SM/O2/166).

DATA AND POLICY TRANSPARENCY While transparency in the Philippines has improved significantly in the past couple of years, and much information is now accessible on websites, there are still problems with transparency. Unreliable data make it difficult to analyze underlying developments, while headline numbers often do not reflect underlying policies. The mission discussed the following issues with the authorities: l National account statistics are at odds with manufacturing production statistics. According to the national accounts, manufacturing has grown by 10 percent between 1998 and 2001. However, the 1992 survey-based production data show a growth of 19 percent during the same period, and the 1994 survey-based data, a growth of only 1 percent. The authorities are addressing this problem, and it is expected that revised data will be available soon. l Balance of payments statistics are unreliable. Official statistics suggest a very large current account surplus in recent years-as much as 12 percent of GNP in 2000. However, errors and omissions and “trade credit” outflows have been even larger-as much as 15 percent of GNP in 2000, which likely reflects a substantial underestimation of electronics imports. To deal with this problem, the authorities have established an interagency task force, which has already produced a preliminary report, and is now estimating the precise adjustment needed. To build on this task force’s work, without pre-empting its conclusions about the historical data, the staff team’s balance of payments projections incorporate an estimated adjustment beginning in January 2003. On this basis, the 2003 current account would be in deficit of about 3 percent of GNP under the baseline trend scenario, and 1 ‘/z percent of GNP under the reform scenario. ~ l Fiscal policy is hard to interpret. While the Philippines meets the requirements of fiscal transparency in many important respects, there are areas that require strengthening. The 1 authorities’ emphasis on the central government budget means that intra-public sector transactions affect the achievement of “the fiscal target”, even when they do not affect the wider public sector balance. Moreover, the accounting of some transactions are not in line with GFS standards, such as the government’s purchase of P 12 billion in NPC securities at the end of 200 1, which was treated as fmancing rather than net lending. Another problem, emphasized by the recent fiscal ROSC, is that the deficit is reported on a cash basis, making comparison of budgets and outcomes very difficult. In particular, it is difficult to assess whether the differences between obligations and cash outlays relate to new programs which have not yet begun, or to arrears. The government has begun to address these problems with the introduction of a new government accounting system, based on a modified accrual basis. In addition, a recent World Bank public sector project aims to improve budgeting through the introduction of a medium-term expenditure framework, better control of contingent liabilities, expanding and computerizing existing information systems, and improving transparency through procurement reform.

SUMMARY OF FSSA FINDINGS The cumulative effects of the Asian crisis have taken their toll on the Philippine financial system. While important efforts are underway, a pre-emptive strategy is needed to avoid systemic problems. The health of the banking system has deteriorated significantly since 1997. Returns on normal banking business have declined steadily, and are now close to zero. The reported aggregate CAR is still reasonably high (13 percent as of September 2001) but is based on an inadequate provisioning level. Adjusting for this and other factors, including deferred charges and equity investments, the aggregate CAR would be about half the reported level. Even this figure may overstate the system’s health, since systemically important banks are part of conglomerate structures, which expose them to additional, hidden, risks. Nonbank intermediaries display varying levels of strength. The equity market, while sizable in terms of capitalization, suffers from low liquidity and governance issues, and languishes well below decade-ago levels in dollar terms. The social insurance institutions are actuarially imbalanced, mainly because contribution rates are relatively low. The pre-needs’ industry- which is small but highly visible, owing to the large number of plans sold-is highly distressed, with an aggregate shortfall in its trust funds. Inconsistencies in the financial framework have distorted the structure of the system. Difference in regulation and supervision have encouraged banks to book risky assets in financial subsidiaries. High and uneven taxation has hampered the development of peso capital markets, while promoting dollar intermediation. High reserve requirements and differential tax arrangements have encouraged deposit substitutes. Meanwhile, the framework for handling banking problems is weak. Under the current system, supervisory authorities have difficulty taking over and closing banks without shareholder approval. Bank owners have been able to block or delay enforcement actions, by securing temporary restraining orders or bringing court cases against supervisory staff for failing to exercise “extraordinary diligence” in their work-an exceptionally high standard. The authorities have been addressing these problems. To better identify and contain banking risks, they have been moving toward consolidated supervision, redefined CARS to align more closely with Base1 standards, and increased provisioning requirements against repossessed assets. They have also requested technical assistance in bank supervision and pension reform. To promote capital markets, they are encouraging the creation of a fixed income exchange, and planning to reform financial transactions taxes. Still, more needs to be done to bring the Philippines into full compliance with the Base1 Core Principles. Priorities include (i) amending the Central Bank Act and General Banking Law to enable the authorities to take action against distressed banks without fear of undue legal repercussions; (ii) strengthening the prompt corrective action framework, to allow early action against nominally solvent but unsound banks; and (iii) implementing a comprehensive consolidated supervisory framework, incorporating risk-focused surveillance techniques. Similar actions are needed on the nonbank side. The authorities should: (i) gradually shift from the current defined benefit pension system towards a financially sustainable defined contribution system; (ii) require pre-needs companies to address the trust fund shortfall promptly, while improving prudential regulations; and (iii) improve the clearing and settlement infrastructure, to ensure the commercial viability of the fixed income exchange. ‘This industry underwrites policies to provide defined future services, such as funerals, education, and pensions.

The health of the banking sector has deteriorated significantly since the Asian crisis. The nonperforming loan ratio of commercial banks has increased from 3 percent in 1996 to almost 20 percent at end-2001; over the same time period, the NPA ratio has increased to 28 percent; and the distressed asset ratio to 35 percent. To assess whether it would be possible for banks to grow out of these problems, two scenarios were run. In the scenarios a wide range of assumptions were used for the growth rate of outstanding bank loans, the rate at which performing bank loans turn into distressed assets, and the interest rate margin on new bank loans. For comparison: in 2001, bank loans fell by 2 percent; 7 percent of performing loans turned into distressed assets, while the interest rate margin on performing assets was 3 percent. The scenarios focused on two indicators of bank health: l Distressed asset ratio, defined as the ratio of nonperforming loans, repossessed assets, and restructured loans (which may have been rescheduled on concessional terms, with long grace periods) to loans and repossessed assets. l Distressed asset to broad capital ratio, defined as the ratio of distressed assets to “broad capital” (the sum of bank capital and loan loss reserves). This ratio gives an indication of the extent to which distressed assets threaten to erode bank capital. The advantage of using broad capital rather than capital proper is that it does not require any judgment on whether loans have been properly provisioned. The scenarios show that if current trends continue, banking sector problems will become much worse (see Scenario 1). If bank loans would remain stagnant, while the inflow ratio of bank loans into distressed assets and the interest rate Scenario I: Different Inflow Ratio and Loan Growth Assumptions margin remain at current levels, the distressed (Assumes mterest maygn of 3 pcrccnt on new loans) (Shaded areas indicate improvement compared with 2001) asset ratio would increase from 35 percent in 2001 Distressed asset ratio in 2006 (2001: 35 percent) to 70 percent in 2006. Meanwhile, the ratio of distressed assets to broad capital would rise from 118 percent in 2001 to 216 percent in 2006.

Even if the inflow ratio drops to 3 percent and loans grow by 20 percent a year, the ratio of distressed assets to broad capital would still increase to 126 percent in 2006. ,nnow ratio 7 6 5 4 3 2 I 0 216 198 180 163 146 130 114 5 213 194 176 158 141 124 108 Loan grmvth 10 209 190 172 154 136 II9 102 15 20s I86 167 149 I31 II3 96 20 201 182 162 144 126 IO8 91 Increases in interest margins would also be needed (see Scenario 2). If bank loans would grow at 20 percent, the inflow ratio would drop to 3 percent, and the interest margin on new loans would double to 6 percent, the distressed asset to broad capital would drop to 103 percent. But this is unlikely.

Indeed, under a wide range of plausible scenarios, the situation is likely to get significantly worse. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - Box 6.

International Financial Statistics slowed, then contracted, and only recovered nodestly so far in 2002. Clearly, exports have been dragged down by the cyclical slump in the global electronics industry. But other factors may also be at work: l Export performance has been worse than in neighboring countries, which are also highly dependent on electronics. And this, in turn, reflects an anemic performance of other exports, especially the garment industry, which has fallen behind in absolute terms and also relative to other competitors. l Foreign direct investment, always much smaller than in neighboring countries, has recently declined, and there is anecdotal evidence that the country has been losing investment to China, even in electronics. l Finally, while the significant real effective depreciation since 1997 erased the appreciation since 1990, the REER remains more appreciated than other countries in the region. None of these indicators are conclusive, but they do signal that this is an area worth watching.

The AMLC has been created and IRRs were signed in April 2002. BSP began implementing BIS capital standards in July 200 1. BSP required banks to report their accounts on a consolidated basis starting September 200 1. However, the BSP has not yet released consolidated CAR ratios. Banks required to reappraise their foreclosed assets every two years beginning January 2002. However, provisioning levels remain inadequate. Increased withholding tax on foreign currency deposits proposed in pending legislation. Some regulatory loopholes were closed in late 2000. The General Banking Act of 2000 increased the BSP’s capacity to take prompt corrective action, but the BSP and PDIC still lack the authority and legal protection to deal effectively with distressed banks. Rehabilitation of the Philippine National Bank (PNB) has proven more difficult than expected. Legislation to reduce transactions costs stalled in Congress. Large taxpayer control improved and computerization program reinvigorated. BIR, however, continues to have major governance problems and revenue performance continues to disappoint. A new set of measures to enhance voluntary compliance, enforce collection procedures and intensify audit have been announced.

Further progress is needed on converting quantitative Proposed bill stalled in legislature. However, initial strategic reviews to prepare for reform have been started for a number of agencies. Power sector reform bill passed in June 2001, which aims to resolve the precarious financial situation of the National Power Corporation (NPC) by privatizing the NPC, eliminating its monopoly in generation, and creating open access in transmission rules and distribution systems. Implementing regulations to pave the way for privatization and deregulation have been drafted but not yet approved by Senate. Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) created to oversee privatization of NPC. PSALM has developed a privatization plan for transmission and generation assets, which is awaiting Presidential approval. Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) established, to replace the Energy Regulatory Board. Among multilaterals, the AsDB has taken the lead in this area, under a Power Sector Reform loan. Average tariffs were further reduced from 8.1 percent at end-2000 to 7.7 percent in 200 1, and to 6.1 percent in 2002. Current rating on the Fund’s index of trade restrictions is 4, on a scale of l-10 (with 1 the most liberal, and 10 the most restrictive). The authorities intend to keep previous commitments to reduce tariffs within ASEAN, although the specific annual path toward the agreed medium-term goals is to be back loaded.

The Supreme Court issued Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation, effective December 2000. With its quasi-judicial powers having been shifted to the courts, the SEC is taking steps to minimize debt restructuring incidents by: (i) imposing more stringent financial disclosure requirements, including bringing accounting rules up to international standards; (ii) regulating external auditors more closely; and (iii) implementing the Code of Corporate Governance, which applies to all corporations (domestic and foreign) whose securities are registered or listed. A corporate recovery law has been submitted to Congress, to strengthen creditor rights and smooth the foreclosure process. The law (Corporate Recovery Act) is being reviewed by the House Committed on Economic Affairs. Steps are being taken to improve its compliance enforcement and surveillance capabilities. Demutualization was completed in August 2001, transforming the PSE into a publicly-held corporation with a diverse ownership, governed by a majority of non-brokers, and managed by an independent and professional group. ’ Established in EBS/98/172, October 1998.

World Bank Lending As of June 30,2002, total World Bank financing in the Philippines amounted to $9,371 million under IBRD loans and $239 million under IDA credits (less cancellations). During FY02, the World Bank (WB) approved two loans for a total of $130 million: the Local Government Unit Urban Water and Sanitation Project, which is the second Adaptable Program Loan ($30 million), and the Second Social Expenditure Management Project ($100 million). As of June 30,2002, the Philippines’ portfolio consists of 23 projects, amounting to $1.3 billion (net of cancellations), of which $425 million has been disbursed. The 23 projects include one Montreal Protocol and the two GEF-financed projects with total commitments of $18 million. By sector, rural development projects continue to constitute the largest share (25 percent), followed closely by human development (24 percent), urban development (18 percent), and transport and energy (16 percent each). The WB has also been involved in non-lending activities to help define development issues. These include core diagnostic reports, sector diagnostic/country advisory reports, and technical assistance. Completions in FY02 include: Development Policy Review, Financial Sector Assistance Program, Public Expenditure, Procurement and Financial Management Review (joint product with Asian Development Bank), Environment Monitor, Out-of-School Youth Report, Anti-corruption Update, Urban Sector Study, and Health Sector Policy Notes. The Bank also designed and launched a new local government unit web portal covering our diverse support for local governments. In addition, the Bank Group also completed a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY03-05 which was presented to the Bank Board on June 4,2002. A Private Sector Development Strategy was completed in collaboration with IFC to feed into the CAS. In keeping with the WB’s Knowledge Sharing initiative, we continue to maintain an enhanced external country web site (www.worldbank.org;.ph) and participate in Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) activities with the World Bank Institute (WBI). With respect to creating and sharing of Bank’s operations and development challenges, the Bank’s Manila office scaledup its Public Information Center (PIC) into a Knowledge Development Center (KDC).

Technical Assistance The World Bank continues to provide technical assistance (TA) to the Philippines through its standard lending and non-lending work, and trust funded activities. FY02 TA supported activities in areas such as: civic engagement in public expenditure, city development strategy, corporate governance, anti-corruption, out-of-school youth, social expenditure management, capacity building for social and environmental assessments, and Mindanao post-conflict assistance. In addition, the Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) Grant Facility continues to provide TA in the preparation of several lending operations. TA for capacity building initiatives is also being provided through the Institutional Development Fund (IDF) and the Bank-managed ASEM Trust Fund.2 Another grant facility-Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF)-is providing grant funding to support activities that impact the most vulnerable and poor in the society. D. Aid Consultative Group The twenty-fourth meeting of the Consultative Group (CG) was held on March 1 l-12,2002 in the Philippines. The World Bank co-chaired the meeting with the Philippine Government, which hosted the CG for the second time. The Development Policy Review, and the Update on Combating Corruption in the Philippines were distributed at this meeting. Overall, the CG partners expressed their support for the government’s development program and indicated total development assistance of $2.8 billion for the Philippines for 2002. Of this, about $2.2 billion is Official Development Assistance and the estimated amount of grant support is $418 million. Mr. Nolan, IMF Senior Resident Representative, attended the meeting. 2 Asia-Europe Meeting-EU’s Asian crisis response fund, created in April 1998; intended to help seven eligible East Asian countries, including the Philippines, to recover from the regional financial crisis.

More than 50 percent of the loans were for projects in the energy and agriculture sectors. In 2001 two new loans were approved for the non-banking sector ($75 million) and basic urban development in Mindanao ($30 million). Nine technical assistance grants were approved in 2001 amounting to $7.7 million. AsDB’s private sector operations, which are made without government guarantee, amounted to $3 19.2 million, including 14 loans of $282.3 million and 18 private equity investments of $32.8 million. The Philippines is the largest client for such activities. In addition, in 1995 AsDB also provided a partial credit guarantee of $120 million to enhance a commercial loan by a bank consortium to the National Power Corporation (NPC). Table 1.

The main weaknesses lie in the national accounts and balance of payments statistics. The national accounts have left largely unrecorded the rapid growth of the electronics sector in the 1990s whereas the balance of payments accounts contain huge gaps in coverage because of large omissions in customs documents of consigned imports of electronic components and the authorities do not mandate reporting on transactions conducted via Foreign Currency Deposit units of domestic banks. To a much lesser extent, financial liberalization has also affected monetary and banking statistics. The Philippines has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). According to the available SDDS information, there are no outstanding issues with the reporting by the Philippine authorities on the reserves template. A. National Accounts Weaknesses in the compilation techniques suggest that the level and growth of quarterly GDP may be underestimated. The problems are shown by large discrepancies between the current-price estimates of GDP by expenditure categories and GDP by type of economic activity (the official GDP measure), with the statistical discrepancy steadily increasing from 2% percent to 7 percent of quarterly GDP over the past two years. The estimates of GDP by expenditure categories grew on average 3% percent (y/y) faster than the quarterly GDP by economic acitvity growth rate, suggesting an understatement of the rapid growth in the electronics industry on the production side of the national accounts. These problems arise because deaths and births of establishments are not adequately measured, a gap of growing importance given the rapid structural change in the economy in recent years. However, the latest available data on active establishments from a 1995 annual survey of establishments, conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO). The 1996 and 1997 annual surveys have been substantially delayed due to funding problems. This implies that a large number of new establishments in the electronics and information technology industry may not be covered in the national accounts. The problems are further compounded by over-reliance on fixed value added-to- output and informal-to-formal sector ratios derived from the 1995 establishment survey. Value added at current prices in the electronics industry is estimated as a fixed share of output in spite of industry evidence that the domestic component of exports has been rising Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - ANNEX V sharply.’ Similarly, the contribution from the informal sector is estimated using a fixed ratio in spite of evidence that the informal-to-formal sector ratio may have increased during the years and decreased subsequently affected by the Asian crisis. Constant price data suffer from further problems, resulting in a substantial underestimation of exports and imports volume growth. The national accounts constant price estimates for merchandise exports and imports are constructed at 1985 unit values (per kilo) multiplied with quantity data (in kilos) from the foreign trade statistics. As a result of this inappropriate method, implicit deflators for electric machinery products are running suspiciously high compared with developments in world market prices (e.g., the implicit deflator for exports of semiconductors and microcircuits increased by more than 900 percent in peso terms since 1985 while world market prices in peso terms have increased by less than 20 percent). B. Balance of Payments There are serious deficiencies in the balance of payments data that render the estimates difficult to interpret and impair macro-economic analysis. The balance of payments shows sizeable errors and omissions arising from reporting gaps and misclassifications in the merchandise imports and in outflows of profits and dividends. The underestimation in the value of imports is mainly attributed to imports of semiconductors on consignment basis.* Also, since the deregulation in the early 1990s international transactions are increasingly flowing through nontraditional channels that are not adequately covered by the statistical reporting system. Consequently, the reporting requirements of the banking system3 relate only to that portion of foreign exchange transactions settled through the Regular Banking Units of domestic banks, which represents about 25 percent of foreign exchange settlements. ’ Official figures for the electronic sector suggest that value added stayed at 10 percent of exports over the past years while industry representatives indicate that the domestic component has increased significantly, to around 30 percent in recent years. 2 Staff had previously estimated that the current account surplus is more likely to have been about 3-5 percent of GNP rather than the official 10% percent of GNP. The technical assistance mission that visited Manila between January 21-February 7,2002 reported that the magnitude of the adjustment could in fact reduce the balance of payments surpluses reported in 1999 and 2000 to small deficits. 3 These are based on the report forms employed during the period of exchange controls, making it difficult to verify data while imposing an unnecessarily large reporting burden on banks. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 55 - ANNEX V In addition, there are important inconsistencies between the Money and Banking, External Debt, Balance of Payments, and National Accounts statistics that hamper economic analysis.” Significant progress was made to improve the coverage and accuracy of the 2001 balance of payments statistics, but the agenda for further action remains large. The authorities have established an interdepartmental BOP Statistical Task Force which has produced a possible range of the needed adjustments in imports of electronic goods. The Task Force is mandated to finalize its recommendations in the next few months. Regarding the other accounts, the major gap continues to relate to transactions conducted via Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs) of domestic banks, where because of strict secrecy rules banks are not mandated to report information for statistical compilation. The lifting of the law on secrecy of bank deposits would require legislative action that is currently beyond the control of the BSP. Other gaps include transactions via nonbank accounts abroad and nonresident peso accounts with domestic banks. If the secrecy rules are not modified to permit the collection of data for statistical purposes, the quality of the balance of payments is likely to remain poor for some time. The authorities have started to undertake surveys and other data sources to help close these gaps, but the implementation of comprehensive enterprise surveys take time and are often impaired by poor response. Furthermore, these problems have been compounded by a lack of resources devoted to compilation of balance of payments statistics. Overall, improving the reliability of balance of payments statistics will require a detailed evaluation of the processing of trade statistics by customs and closer collaboration between the customs administration, the Ministry of Finance, and the central bank. C. Monetary Accounts While the framework underlying the compilation of the monetary statistics largely conforms to the Fund’s methodology, major structural changes in the financial system following liberalization have affected data for the central bank, commercial banks, and nonbank financial intermediaries. A Monetary and Financial Statistics mission visited Manila in February 2002. The aims of the mission were to review the implementation of recommendations made by an earlier mission in November 2000; to review the BSP’s existing compilation framework and make recommendations to improve its quality and timeliness; to resolve its most important outstanding methodological issues related to monetary aggregates; to establish a unified system for reporting monetary data to the IMF; and to discuss the implications of the new Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual for the compilation of monetary and financial data. 4 For example, the national accounts include higher workers’ remittances than the balance of payments. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 56 - ANNEX V The mission identified improvements that should be implemented to improve the quality of the monetary aggregates. In terms of coverage, the growth in activities of rural and thrift banks, offshore banking units, as well as non-bank financial intermediaries have so far not been captured in the monetary aggregates. Efforts are underway to compile a depository corporations survey (banking survey) that would cover all institutions that accept deposits or issue instruments that are considered as their substitutes. Also, to improve the quality of the statistics the treatment of nonoperational banks, valuation of foreign exchange-denominated accounts of the BSP, and accrued interest in monetary statistics aggregates need to be brought into line with international norms. D. Fiscal Data While the Philippines meets the requirements of fiscal transparency in many important respects, the recent fiscal ROSC found areas that require strengthening. An important problem is that the budget is presented on an obligation basis, while the deficit is reported on a cash basis, which makes comparisons of budgets and outcomes very difficult. This problem is exacerbated by fundamental gaps in the internal information system which allow agencies to incur obligations without assurances that cash will be available. Moreover, the obligations- based presentation may lead to a distorted view of budgetary policy, since there is often a lack of a clear distinction between existing commitments for which payment is due (i.e., arrears) and new programs which have not yet begun.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with the Philippines On [September II, 20021, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with the Philippines.’ Background Over the past 15 years, successive governments have made significant progress in establishing a market-oriented economy in the Philippines. Despite these efforts, the legacy of the past has proved difficult to overcome, and the economy has remained troubled. For these reasons, the Arroyo administration has reinvigorated the reform effort. It plans to balance the budget by 2006, clean up the banking system, deregulate the power sector, and rely on commercial financing until the reforms take hold. During its first year, the new administration made significant progress in implementing its agenda. It halted the fiscal deterioration, essentially keeping the deficit to the targeted 4’% percent of GNP and pushed through with structural reforms, especially reviving the energy sector deregulation bill. These efforts have borne some initial fruit. Despite a very difficult international environment, marked by waves of financial pressure and a sharp fall in electronics exports, the Philippine economy grew by 3 percent in 2001. In the first half of 2002, growth quickened to around 3% percent, aided by recovering exports, while inflation decelerated to 3% percent, helped by a relatively stable exchange rate. Such results have won ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [September 11, 20021 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

At the same time, however, underlying policy progress has begun to slip. Implementation of the power sector reform and passage of the AMC bill have been caught up in political maneuvering, delaying both measures and raising questions about whether the authorities’ aims can be achieved. At the same time, fiscal performance has veered away from the programmed path. Revenue collections were below target during January-June, and remained essentially unchanged compared to their year-ago level while spending raced well ahead of last year’s pace, the result of a conscious decision to front-load expenditures. Consequently, by June the cumulative deficit had reached PI20 billion, not far short of the full-year target of P 130 billion. So far, investor confidence in the Philippines has remained reasonably robust, partly attributed to the fact that the bulk of the country’s external commercial borrowing for 2002 has already been completed, while international reserves are a comfortable 120 percent of short-term debt. Spreads on the country’s international bonds have increased somewhat since mid-May, but levels remain well below their October 2001 peak.
