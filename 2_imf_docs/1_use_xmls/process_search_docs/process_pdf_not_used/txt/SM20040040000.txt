Real GDP growth surged 7.2 percent while inflation remained subdued at 0.5 percent. The central government fiscal position improved considerably on account of record-high oil revenues, with the overall balance registering a surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP compared to a deficit of 5.9 percent in 2002. At the same time, government debt declined by 15 percentage points to 82 percent of GDP. The external current account surplus increased to 13.8 percent of GDP and SAMA’s foreign assets increased by $17.7 billion to the equivalent of 10.8 months of imports. The equity market registered its fifth consecutive year of growth, with its general index up by 76 percent and market capitalization reaching 73 percent of GDP. Structural reforms have continued to be implemented in a phased manner, with good progress on the legislative and financial sector fronts.  Taking into account the favorable developments in the oil market, the macroeconomic position is expected to continue to be strong in 2004 and over the medium term. Both oil and non-oil real GDP are projected to grow by 5 percent, and real gross domestic income by about 17 percent of GDP in 2004. Fiscal and current account surpluses are projected at 8 percent of GDP and 20 percent, respectively. SAMA’s foreign assets are projected to increase further to reach about $90 billion in 2004, equivalent to 15 months of imports.  Policy Discussions:  • The fiscal position is projected to remain comfortable over the medium term. However, achieving the projected fiscal consolidation and debt reduction will require continued efforts to strengthen the structure of the budget through containment of recurrent primary expenditure and mobilization of non-oil revenues.  • The authorities’ plan to use higher oil revenues for health, education, infrastructure development, and for a significant reduction of government debt, is appropriate, and would enhance political support for the ongoing structural reforms.  • Generating employment for the fast growing Saudi labor force and reducing the prevailing high level of unemployment will continue to remain the most important economic challenge. The staff endorses the authorities’ position to sustain the pace of structural reform to support private sector-led non-oil economic expansion as critical to solving the unemployment problem.  • The staff also encourages the authorities to implement the FSAP recommendations to strengthen further the resilience of the Saudi financial system. • Although progress has been made in improving Saudi Arabia’s economic statistics, national accounts, balance of payments statistics, and fiscal consolidation at the general government level are priority areas for attention. Participation in the Fund’s GDDS is encouraged.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 4 - I.   BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS A.   Overview1 1.      Reflecting prudent macroeconomic management and sharply higher oil prices and production, economic conditions improved significantly in 2003 and 2004. Strong growth in oil revenue generated substantial fiscal and current account surpluses, and resulted in a large accumulation of foreign assets. The authorities reaffirmed Saudi Arabia’s commitment to ensure oil market stability (Box 1). To this end, they indicated that they would continue to meet higher world oil demand by expanding oil production capacity.  2.      Over the past several years, the Saudi authorities have undertaken a comprehensive structural reform program to accomplish the following objectives: (a) accelerate non-oil growth; (b) address unemployment among Saudi nationals; (c) reduce the economy’s vulnerability to adverse oil revenue shocks; and (d) maintain monetary and financial stability. The underlying strategy aims at reducing the role of the public sector through restructuring and privatization, divestment of government’s shares in publicly traded companies, fiscal consolidation through public expenditure restraint, and improved budget management. The training of Saudi nationals to increase their employment opportunities has also been an important ingredient of this strategy. 3.      In recent years, Fund policy advice has centered on eliminating the budget deficit, reducing government debt, and accelerating the implementation of the reform agenda which has proceeded in a phased manner since 2000. In the event, fiscal consolidation has been stronger than envisaged mainly on account of higher oil revenues and cuts in non-social recurrent outlays, and reduction of government debt has been significant. As regards structural reforms,  the authorities have focused on enacting laws and regulations to expand areas for private sector activities (including Foreign Direct Investment), and on enhancing the legal foundations for the expansion and regulation of financial and capital markets. Concurrently, steps have been taken to facilitate the development of institutions needed to enforce the regulatory framework governing private sector activities. The privatization of state enterprises and private sector participation in public sector dominated activities has also been successfully initiated. The Capital Markets Law (CML) and the Insurance Law were approved by the Council of Ministers in 2003. A number of other laws also remain under consideration. The authorities are implementing the reform agenda at a pace they consider appropriate, taking into account their socio-political environment.                                                  1 Saudi Arabia’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II, respectively. Data issues are covered in Appendix III. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 5 -  Box 1. Recent Developments in the Oil Market and the Role of Saudi Arabia  Recent developments in the global oil market: World oil markets since mid-2003 have been driven by strong demand growth, dwindling surplus capacity, and concerns about potential supply disruptions in several key producing countries. Oil prices have increased persistently since April 2003 and hit record highs in October 2004. During the past year, the International Energy Agency has repeatedly revised upwards its world oil demand estimates, mainly due to the stronger-than-expected demand growth in China and the United States. Speculation activity by hedge funds further contributed to volatility in prices.   The October World Economic Outlook (WEO) oil price projection puts the average in 2004 at $38.5 per barrel, up from just under $29 per barrel in 2003. Global oil demand is forecasted to grow by 3.2 percent in 2004, the strongest increase in many years. However, despite concerns about the shrinking cushion between world consumption and potential supply, there is no evidence of physical shortages of either crude or refined products. Global oil supplies started to run well ahead of demand in recent months, driven primarily by higher production in the Gulf states, notably Saudi Arabia. OPEC lifted oil production quotas in three steps in June, August and November, and most OPEC members are currently producing well above their quota. However, there are concerns about an increasing market mismatch regarding the crude oil qualities demanded and supplied. Presently, international oil markets are short of light sweet crudes, while there are indications of an oversupply of heavy sour grades, particularly from Arab oil producing countries.  Saudi Arabia’s role in the oil market: With huge oil reserves (262 billion barrels), around 12 percent of global production, and 16 percent of world exports, Saudi Arabia is the leading producer and exporter of crude oil in the world. The kingdom has followed a policy of fostering a stable international oil market, and has been playing an important and constructive role in ensuring oil market stability by compensating for production shortfalls in other countries and by accommodating growing global demand for oil by sustaining the country’s production capacity well above its OPEC quotas in recent years. In order to promote oil market stability, Saudi Arabia is interested in enhancing transparency in data-related petroleum production, consumption, and inventory. The authorities are of the view that such information is crucial for investment planning and demand forecasting, and also encouraged IMF participation in the Joint Oil Data Initiative of the International Energy Forum. The authorities plan to sustain production capacity at levels comfortably above the level of production, and to increase exports further by substituting gas for oil in electricity generation and petrochemical industries. The Saudi authorities’ firm commitment to utilize its vast oil resources and make necessary investments to increase further its output and production capacity, if global demand continues to remain strong, will play a critical role in calming the prevailing volatile oil market environment. Information on the operations of the major oil company and the uses of petroleum proceeds, including the investment plans, will also help in improving further oil sector transparency.

Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Structural Reforms 4.      Real GDP grew by 7.2 percent in 2003, reflecting a 15 percent rise in oil production accompanied by a 3.8 percent increase in nonhydrocarbon activities (Table 1). Private sector activity was sluggish in the beginning of 2003, but gained momentum in the second-half of the year in the aftermath of the Iraq war. Accounting for the positive terms-of-trade effect, real gross domestic income (RGDI) increased by 11.7 percent. Low interest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate in real effective terms gave an additional lift to local manufacturers and exporters. Inflation was slightly positive (0.5 percent) for the first time in several years. The stock market remained buoyant, with the stock price index increasing by 76 percent and market capitalization rising by 110 percent to 73 percent of GDP in 2003. Demand for stocks, mainly domestic, was driven by increased confidence, ample liquidity, and strong economic fundamentals. The official rate of unemployment of the Saudi workforce, however, remained high at 9.6 percent.  Fiscal policy  5.      The central government budget position improved considerably in 2003 on account of high oil revenues and moderate expenditure increases. Reflecting a 39 percent increase in oil revenues, the overall fiscal balance switched from a deficit equivalent to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2002 to a surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2003. Much of the increase in oil revenue was saved (about 80 percent), and the underlying primary non-oil deficit increased moderately by one percentage point to 42 percent of non-oil GDP (Table 2). Central government debt was reduced by 15 percentage points to 82 percent of GDP.

On the expenditure side, fiscal consolidation was supported through cuts in areas other than education and social development,2 although defense and domestic security expenditure increased significantly (by 18 percent). In particular, recurrent outlays other than security and defense declined in nominal terms for the second year in a row. Non-oil revenues declined in nominal terms, because of the inelasticity of non-oil revenues and the reduction of custom duty rates in the context of ongoing trade reforms, including the adoption of the Common External Tariff for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. 7.      The financial position of government pension and investment funds strengthened further in 2003.3 While the staff does not have the total asset position of the Autonomous Government Institutions (AGIs),4 assets of the AGIs held at SAMA increased by 5.7 percentage points to stand at 55.3 percent of GDP at end-2003.5 In particular, the accumulation of foreign assets continued, reaching over $38 billion (18 percent of GDP). Net assets of the Specialized Credit Institutions (SCIs)6 increased by 1.8 percentage points to reach 29 percent of GDP at end-2003. Among the SCIs, net assets of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) reached 12.3 percent of GDP at end-2003, of which 81 percent were domestic loans or equity investments. The financial position of the PIF improved in 2003 with higher revenues and transfers to the budget equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP.                                                    2 Expenditures on education and social development increased by 4 percent and 9 percent, respectively. Expenditures excluding defense, security, education, and social development were cut by 5 percent. 3 A study by Standard & Poor’s published by SAMA estimated the general government balance at 6.7 percent of GDP in 2003, and its net asset position at about 50 percent of GDP. 4 The AGIs consist of two social security institutions, the Saudi Development Fund, and other institutions. 5 The AGIs also hold government securities worth 61 percent of GDP. Part of it could be held by SAMA and the extent of the overlap is unknown. 6 The SCIs are public financial institutions that extend interest-free loans for public policy purposes in areas such as housing, agriculture, and industry.

Broad money increased by 8.2 percent to keep pace with increases in demand (Table 3). Following the trend in global financial markets, the official repo (repurchase agreement) and reverse repo rates were reduced by 25 basis points each to 1.75 and 1.25 percent, respectively. Interest rates continued their downward trend due to high liquidity, the decline in global interest rates, and the reduction in the SAMA’s official repo rate. The spread with U.S. dollar deposit rates remained stable at about 50 basis points in favor of the riyal in 2003 on average, and thereafter declined to about 25 basis points in early 2004. SAMA’s placement of deposits with commercial banks during 2003 contributed to the expansion in net bank credit (15.5 percent), supported by declining interest rates and increasing economic activity. The increase in net foreign assets (NFA) did not lead to an expansion in domestic liquidity, as it was sterilized through a build up of assets with SAMA. Expansion of credit to the private sector remained healthy at 11 percent and consumer loans continued to grow faster than total credit to the private sector.  External sector 9.      The favorable developments in the oil market contributed to the external current account surplus in 2003, which more than doubled to $30 billion (13.8 percent of GDP) (Table 4). Oil export earnings increased by 32 percent to about $84 billion, and non-oil exports increased by 28 percent mainly on account of strong growth in petrochemical products and manufacturing exports. As a result, total exports increased by 31.5 percent to about $95.2 billion. Reflecting the strong performance of the non-oil manufacturing sector, growth in government consumption, and a rebound in investment, imports grew by Monetary Developments(Changes in percent of beginning money stock)-15-10-50510152025199920002001200220032004Broad Money (M3)Net Claims on Private Sector Net Foreign AssetsSource: Data provided by the Saudi Arabian authorities; and Fund staff estimates.(Proj.) 3-months Deposit Interest Rates and Eurodollar Rates, 1999 Q1 - 2004 Q3012345678Jan-99Jul-99Jan-00Jul-00Jan-01Jul-01Jan-02Jul-02Jan-03Jul-03Jan-04Jul-04Saudi Arabian Riyal DepositsEurodollar DepositsSource: Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency.

The trade surplus increased by 43 percent to $61 billion, while the deficit in the service account widened slightly to $31.5 billion. The capital account showed a net outflow of about US$12 billion due to investments made abroad by the private and public sectors. The overall balance of payments registered a surplus of $17.6 billion—resulting in an increase in SAMA’s gross foreign assets to the equivalent of about 11 months of imports of goods and services. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar against major currencies and the low inflation in Saudi Arabia have contributed to the depreciation of the riyal by about 20 percent in real effective terms during 2002–August 2004, enhancing the competitiveness of non-oil exports.  Financial sector developments 10.      The FSAP exercise concluded that the Saudi banking system is stable, profitable, and effectively supervised.7 Bank supervision and regulation are effective. The ratio of nonperforming loans (NPL) to total loans fell from 9.2 percent to 5.4 percent in 2003 (Table 5), and loan loss provisioning exceeds the amount of nonperforming loans by a significant margin. The financial system was further strengthened with approval of the Capital Market and Insurance laws in 2003. The implementing regulations for the former are being finalized by the Capital Market Authority Board which was appointed in July 2004. The Saudi Credit Bureau is fully operational and new information posted on SAMA’s website is contributing to greater transparency.  11.      The banking sector is being opened further to foreign banks. In line with the GCC policy to open up domestic financial sectors to all GCC investors, four banks from the GCC countries were granted licenses to operate in Saudi Arabia during 2002–04. Also, three foreign banks were licensed to operate in Saudi Arabia in 2004, and further applications are being considered by the authorities. Islamic banking services (IBS) continued to develop faster than conventional banking activities and its share of total banking assets grew from 17 percent to 21 percent, and the number of IBS-related mutual funds increased from 55 to 69 in 2003. 12.      The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) concluded that Saudi Arabia is compliant or largely compliant with most of its 40+8 recommendations. The evaluation of anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) framework was conducted in September 2003. Saudi Arabia has had AML regulations                                                  7 For a full discussion of the FSAP findings, see the document “Saudi Arabia: Financial System Stability Assessment” prepared by MFD and MCD.

A more comprehensive AML law was enacted in August 2003, and its implementation rules were issued in February 2004. The AML and CFT regulatory framework covers financial institutions such as insurance companies and investment companies as well as commercial and specialized banks. Structural reforms 13.      The Saudiization policy continued to be operated flexibly. In addition to efforts to increase technical skills of the Saudi labor force, administrative limits have been imposed in August 2004 restricting the number of expatriate workers an employer can have at one time. In October 2004, GCC labor ministers approved a series of additional measures aimed at increasing the number of their nationals in the active workforce and discouraging the hiring of foreigners.  14.      The increased role of the private sector in the economy is being pursued through privatization, divestments, and allowing private sector participation in sectors previously dominated by the public sector. Although there have been no major privatizations since the 30 percent sale of the equity stake of Saudi Telecom (STC) in January 2003, progress has been made with plans to privatize 31 water desalination projects. Plans to privatize the National Company for Cooperative Insurance (NCCI) have been postponed pending the enactment of the new Insurance law. The privatization plan also includes the National Commercial Bank, the Saudi Railways Organization, and Saudia Airlines. The role of the private sector in postal and port services, telecommunications, and in provisions of health and education is expanding rapidly. Regulatory arrangements are also being strengthened to foster a growing private sector role while ensuring quality and competition. The Competition Law, introducing provisions to prevent monopolistic practices, protect consumers, and establish a level playing field for Saudi and foreign companies in line with WTO standards, was approved in June 2004.  II.   REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS 15.      The discussions focused on the recent economic developments and policy implementation; the outlook for 2004 and the medium term; the authorities’ plans regarding the use of the projected fiscal and current account surpluses; policies underpinning the medium-term fiscal consolidation and debt reduction objectives; and the opportunities for accelerating the reform program. Other issues discussed included progress toward regional economic integration in the context of the GCC, accession to the WTO, and data issues.  A.   Projections for 2004 and Medium-Term Outlook 16.      Based on the WEO oil price assumptions,8 large fiscal and current account surpluses are expected in 2004. Both oil and non-oil GDP are projected to grow at about                                                  8 Oil price projections in this report are based on the October 2004 WEO assumptions, which are consistent with an average oil price for Saudi Arabia of about $36.7 per barrel in 2004. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 11 - 5 percent. Manufacturing, transport, construction, and higher investment in the hydrocarbon sector are expected to be the major contributors to growth. The authorities believe that non-oil GDP growth rate would most likely be revised upward after final figures for 2004 are compiled, given the strong demand for credit and prevailing optimism. Accounting for the positive terms-of-trade effect, real gross domestic income is expected to increase by 17 percent. 17.      With a projected 37 percent increase in oil revenue and continued efforts to contain fiscal spending, the central government budget surplus is expected to increase further to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2004. One-third of the fiscal improvement would be due to containment of the wage bill, and reductions in farm subsidies, interest payments, and other operational spending. Procurement prices of wheat have been reduced by one-third to SRls 1,000 per ton and the subsidy on barley eliminated; the authorities have also settled unpaid subsidies amounting to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2004. After accounting for continuing higher than normal increases in the social sector and security-related spending, the underlying non-oil primary deficit is expected to widen by about one percentage point to 43 percent of non-oil GDP. Meanwhile, the central government debt is likely to drop further by 22 percentage points to about 60 percent of GDP.  18.      The projected strong external sector outcome reflects a moderate increase in oil production and a 36 percent increase in oil export price. Non-oil export growth is also expected to remain robust (16 percent), driven mostly by growth in petrochemicals and manufactured goods. Imports are projected to grow by about 12 percent, reflecting mainly higher activity in the non-oil economy and the increase in international import prices. The current account surplus is projected to increase further to 20 percent of GDP. 19.      The medium-term outlook remains favorable on the expectation that world oil prices will decline only gradually9 and oil production will remain relatively high. Real non-oil GDP growth is projected to remain steady at around 5 percent over the medium term, supported by construction, manufacturing, mining and gas exploration, a surge in religious tourism following the liberalization of the Umrah visa,10 and continued expansion of the petrochemical sector. The main assumptions underpinning the baseline scenario are a gradual decline in the price of crude oil in line with the WEO oil price projections and Saudi oil production at a level of 9.3 millions barrels per day (b/d). The external current account surplus,                                                  9 In line with the October 2004 WEO projections, average oil export prices are projected to increase further to $40.8 in 2005, before declining by about 10 percent in 2006 and by 4 percent annually, on average, between 2006–09. 10 Visa granted to perform religious rites in Mecca during periods other than the period of the Haj pilgrimage.

With continuing efforts to contain primary current outlays and to increase non-oil revenues, the fiscal position is projected to remain comfortable over the medium term, despite gradually declining oil revenues. The staff projects that the budget surplus would decline from 10 percent of GDP in 2005 to about 3 percent of GDP in 2009 and the debt-to-GDP ratio would drop by two-thirds to 21 percent. While allowing for moderate increases in primary expenditure in nominal terms, these projections entail significant fiscal tightening primarily through a tight control of the wage bill and other current expenditures, and broadening of the indirect tax base. Consequently, the non-oil primary deficit would decline from 44.8 percent of non-oil GDP in 2005 to 34.5 percent in 2009.  21.      There are downside risks to this favorable medium-term outlook, since it is based on historically high levels of oil price and output assumptions. The authorities observed that the medium-term projections, based on WEO’s baseline oil prices, were subject to a great deal of uncertainty relating to world oil demand and supply. They noted that a large degree of uncertainty remained with regard to the accuracy of oil market data and developments in supply-demand balance, pointing to possible substantial downside risks to the oil price projection as experienced in the recent past. On the assumption of an oil price that is $5 per barrel below the present WEO projections—equivalent to about one standard-deviation below the baseline—staff estimates indicate that the fiscal surplus expressed in percent of GDP would be about 3.3 percent lower than in the baseline scenario in 2005 and steadily switch to a deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP by 2009. The current level of non-oil deficit (22 percent of GDP in 2004) is sustainable over the medium term given the oil price projection. The envisaged medium-term stance of fiscal policy will remain sustainable with oil prices as low as $27 per barrel.

Macroeconomic Policies Fiscal policy 22.      The comfortable fiscal position projected over the medium term is based on the authorities’ intention to contain the growth of recurrent primary outlays with a view to tightening of the underlying non-oil fiscal position and to achieve a rapid reduction in government debt. The authorities are also aware of the growing demands for social sector spending and accordingly plan to allow for significant increases in allocations for health, education and infrastructure development. The authorities are cautious about the petroleum price outlook, being mindful about their recent experience with downturns in oil prices, and expressed their strong intention to give priority to utilizing a large portion of the projected oil revenues for reduction of government debt. They indicated, however, that if the projected oil revenues over the medium term materialize, there would be room for further increases in spending. The staff agreed with the authorities’ cautious approach, in particular, taking note of the very high non-oil primary deficit in relation to non-oil GDP and the vulnerability of the medium-term fiscal consolidation and debt reduction to lower oil prices.   23.      On the expenditure side, the authorities’ policy stance entails modest overall spending increases over the medium term. Savings in the interest bill due to lower debt levels would allow for a somewhat higher growth in primary spending (2.5 percent in real terms). In particular, the authorities’ expenditure plan includes an additional SRIs 41 billion (about 4 percent of GDP) on social sector programs and infrastructure development during 2005–09. The staff noted that the cautious expenditure plan envisaged by the authorities would need to be supported by wide-ranging structural reforms affecting both expenditure policies—in particular, wage bill and subsidies—and budget management. In this context, the staff recommended that the authorities consider initiating a comprehensive civil service reform in addition to the ongoing rationalization of staffing needs. The authorities indicated that pressure to revise the salary structure of the public sector, frozen for more than two decades, was likely to intensify, while at the same time, the corporatization of state enterprises and their privatization would reduce the public sector payroll over the medium term. The authorities agreed that subsidies and transfer programs should be better targeted, and pointed to the recent elimination of the subsidy on barley and substantial reduction of the subsidy on wheat as a demonstration of their efforts in improving budgetary management.11 With regard to domestic petroleum prices, implicit subsidies have emerged as a result of recent increases in international oil prices. To this end, the authorities intend to adjust domestic petroleum prices, as appropriate, by end-2005 taking into account the developments in international oil prices.                                                  11 Total subsidies and transfer accounted for about 1.3 percent of GDP in 2003. The subsidy on wheat and barley fluctuated in the range of 0.4–0.8 percent of GDP in recent years, depending on world market prices and the volume of domestic production and consumption.

On the revenue side, the staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to consider, at an appropriate time, broadening the indirect tax base. The staff agreed with the authorities that coordination with other GCC countries on the introduction and harmonization of taxes, particularly with regard to indirect taxes, was appropriate. The staff recommended the simultaneous introduction of a VAT at a low rate, excise duties on selected consumer goods, and income taxes applied uniformly to domestic and foreign taxpayers. The new corporate tax law, approved in January 2004, which cuts the tax rate on foreign businesses from 30 to 20 percent, is a step in the right direction even though Saudi businesses do not pay any corporate tax. The authorities noted that, although there was scope for further equalization of tax incidence between domestic and foreign firms, Zakat—an Islamic tax on wealth—paid by Saudi firms was equivalent to about two-thirds of the tax levied on foreign companies, and should be factored into the comparison. 25.      The staff recommended that budget management be improved by setting appropriations closer to the expected outcome. The authorities noted that they were making progress in that direction. In addition, a concrete framework should be introduced to identify, monitor, and resolve unanticipated claims and extra-budgetary outlays. The staff considered the clearing of late payments to farmers that accompanied the reduction in wheat subsidies as an important step in that direction. Transparency in accounting for the oil revenues, including the proportion accruing to the budget, will also help budget management. 26.      To limit the negative impact of fluctuations in oil revenue on private sector growth, the staff recommended casting the budget in a medium-term framework. This framework should be based on conservative but realistic oil revenue assumptions with a well-defined fiscal rule to smooth out expenditure growth, target a declining non-oil deficit to non-oil GDP ratio, and setting aside a part of oil revenue in a fund for future generations. While agreeing in principle with the staff’s views, the authorities indicated that, at this stage, their priorities were to reduce government debt, increase investment in the education and health sectors, and attend to long delayed infrastructure and maintenance needs. They pointed out that the existing public funds, such as the PIF, already had a stabilizing impact as their activities were shielded from the volatility of oil revenues. Their capital was increased when funds became available, and they returned stable dividends to the budget. Finally, the authorities indicated that they would rather wait for the projected fiscal surpluses to materialize and pay off government debt before considering other formal mechanisms to build up assets. 27.      The staff noted that the consolidation of the general government accounts would provide a better understanding of the impact of fiscal policy operations in Saudi Arabia. After taking into account the available information on the strongly positive financial positions of the government pension and investment funds, the consolidated position and the level of net assets at the general government level would give a significantly more favorable picture than that indicated by the central government position. The authorities recognized the merits of basing the analysis on the consolidated general government operations, and noted that such an analysis was taken into account in formulating government policies. However, they felt that the consolidation and the dissemination of such information could undermine fiscal discipline. They also stressed Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 15 - that the surplus positions of the two pension funds should be kept apart from the budget, given their long-term obligations to the participants. The staff observed that, although information on the operations at the general government level is not yet complete, efforts could be made to prepare the consolidated fiscal presentation so that it could be used for the next Article IV consultation discussions.  Monetary and financial sector policies, and the exchange system 28.      The authorities’ prudent conduct of monetary policy has contributed to price stability and supported the exchange rate peg. In line with the GCC decision to adopt a monetary union by 2010, the Saudi riyal has been officially pegged to the U.S. dollar since 2003. The authorities do not foresee a change in the exchange rate policy in the near term. They indicated that the current pegged exchange regime has served them well in ensuring price stability. The recent depreciation of the riyal in real effective terms has also increased the competitiveness of Saudi exports as evidenced by the strong growth of non-oil exports. They informed the staff that the current peg would be maintained until the formation of the GCC monetary union and, at this point, all options remain open regarding the exchange rate regime under the monetary union. The staff agreed with the authorities’ position regarding the choice of the exchange rate policy under the planned monetary union, noting that all relevant aspects should be carefully studied before deciding on this important issue.  29.      The staff proposed that any reduction in government debt, using the fiscal surpluses in coming years, should be done gradually, taking into account the impact of such an operation on liquidity in the system and on SAMA’s ability to conduct monetary policy using indirect monetary instruments. The authorities were of the view that reduction of government debt was a priority, and if needed, SAMA could always issue its own certificates of deposits for the purpose of monetary policy operations. In this connection, the staff urged the authorities to undertake reforms aimed at deepening the secondary market for government securities and facilitating the evolution of a more robust riyal yield curve against which other markets can benchmark.  30.      The staff commended the authorities for fostering a well supervised and strong banking system. It also welcomed the progress made in implementing some of the FSAP recommendations with the aim of strengthening financial supervision and regulation. A new regulation on the use of uniform standards of loan classification and provisioning is in force since March 2004. The staff encouraged the authorities to implement the remaining FSAP recommendations in order to further strengthen the resilience of the Saudi financial system and enhance its growth-promoting role. In particular, banking regulation and supervision need to take into account the special nature of Islamic banking operations. Also, the limited foreclosure possibilities which hamper the development of a private mortgage market should be addressed. Furthermore, the authorities are encouraged to consider enhancing the growth of primary and secondary markets by easing the legal constraints on the issuance of corporate bonds.

Structural reforms will continue to aim, as a first step, at developing the legal and institutional foundations to promote private sector-led growth under market-determined conditions. These reforms will entail not only privatization of state enterprises but—more importantly—a broadening of the scope of private sector investment (including FDI) into areas hitherto limited to the public sector. The authorities’ strategy also incorporates efforts at improving the skill mix of Saudi entrants into the labor market and the substitutability of Saudis for expatriate workers through skill enhancement and real wage flexibility for the national workforce. Private sector development 32.      Private sector investment (including FDI) has picked up in recent years, but it is still considered to be well below its potential level.12 A significant increase in private investment is crucial for creating employment opportunities for the new entrants to the labor force. Prospects for 2004 indicate a substantial rise in private investment, which needs to be sustained in the future through steady implementation of structural reforms. In this respect, a further streamlining of administrative procedures and a further liberalization of foreign investors’ access to the domestic financial market would encourage FDI. The staff notes that there is an opportunity to build on the momentum of the recent contracts with international companies under the modified gas initiative to catalyze private investment in other related sectors. Also, the staff is of the view that the authorities should expedite the implementation of a number of laws, such as the Company Law and the Agency Law (at advanced stages of preparation as of mid-2004), to foster a rules-based environment for stronger private sector growth.  33.      The increased role of the private sector in the economy is being pursued through privatization,13 divestment of the remaining government shares in publicly traded companies, and allowing private sector participation in sectors previously dominated by the public sector. The authorities noted that except for utilities (water and electricity) and oil production, all other commercial-type operations are being transferred to private sector management. Government shares in publicly traded companies will continue to be sold to the public, taking into account market conditions, with consideration also given to small investors. The authorities emphasized the need to follow a cautious approach in restructuring and privatizing state enterprises to ensure that privatization is consistent with the absorptive capacity of the capital market. They also indicated that, in the near term, the focus would be on privatization of the Saudi Electricity Company and the water sector, and that the government                                                  12 After stagnating during the late 1990s, private sector gross fixed capital formation grew at a compound rate of about 5 percent during the period 2002–03, with a further surge envisaged in 2004. 13 Private sector non-oil GDP in relation to total non-oil GDP has been increasing over time and has increased by 3 percentage points since 1997 to 65.4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2003. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 17 - intends to sell its shares in the National Company for Cooperative Insurance (NCCI). In this connection, the mission welcomes the progress made so far in increasing the private sector role in the postal and port services and telecommunications, and in the provision of health and education.  Labor market policies 34.      In conjunction with structural reforms, since 2001 the authorities have been implementing a three-pronged strategy to address the unemployment pressures and to generate the skills required to sustain growth. This strategy includes: (a) educational and vocational training to improve productivity and meet the skill demands in the private sector; (b) Saudiization of the labor force; and (c) changing the institutional and legal framework to facilitate the substitutability of Saudis for expatriates under an open and integrated labor market with market-determined wages. 35.      The education system is being reformed on a priority basis. Schools and universities curricula are being further adjusted to produce graduates with skills demanded by the private sector, in particular technical, business, and language skills. Private businesses are also developing capacity to offer in-house vocational training programs. Grants for training and recruiting nationals by the private sector will continue to be provided by the Human Development Resource Fund (HDRF), in addition to time-bound wage sharing agreements with businesses that employ Saudi nationals. The authorities noted that financial costs associated with these activities were being covered by the HDRF through fees for hiring and renewal of work permits for foreign nationals. 36.      The mission supported the authorities’ flexible application of the Saudiization program and greater focus on training, which should continue to be a priority. In addition, an early approval and implementation of the planned Labor Law would be particularly helpful to increase labor mobility and provide greater flexibility in employer/-employee relationships. Employment in the private sector should be encouraged through skills development and rationalizing the compensation and incentive structures between the public and the private sectors, thereby integrating the currently segmented labor market. In concurring with the staff position, the authorities noted that by freezing the public sector wage structure over the last two decades and enhancing the skill levels of Saudi workers, they were aiming to achieve such a shift in relative benefits. The portability of pension benefits enacted in September 2003 would facilitate this process. D.   Trade Policy Developments and Regional Integration 37.      Significant progress has been made in the effort to join the WTO, and bilateral negotiations with the United States are still continuing. On the legislative front, the government has promulgated the Competition Law in June 2004. Bilateral agreements have been signed with 35 WTO members. The authorities are of the view that considerable progress has been made, and the remaining issues in the bilateral negotiations, can be resolved quickly. The authorities expect that Saudi Arabia would be able to accede to the WTO in 2005.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 18 - 38.      Following the introduction of the GCC common external tariff, about 92 percent of total import items are now subject to 5 percent rates, down from 12 percent in the past. Negotiations are ongoing with other GCC countries to adopt a common list for the remaining items. Other non-tariff barriers do not exist, except standard rules applied to test products against specifications. Regarding regional trade liberalization, the authorities indicated that tariff cuts under the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) were continuing under an accelerated program. In 2004, these rates were cut by 20 percent, and by 2005, there would be no import duties on products from the Arab countries.  39.      Technical committees are making progress in their work on identifying the convergence criteria for the establishment of the monetary union by 2010. The authorities noted that the necessary consensus building process in defining the convergence criteria and in developing institutional arrangement were progressing well. The issues that the committees are reviewing include fiscal policy convergence criteria, labor polices, measures needed to integrate the financial markets across the GCC countries, and establishment of a common central bank.  E.   Statistical Issues and Technical Assistance 40.      The authorities concurred with the staff that further improvements to the macroeconomic database are needed, and pointed, in particular, to weaknesses in national accounts statistics owing to inadequate coverage of private sector activities. Areas for improvement also include an early transition of balance of payments data in line with the Fifth Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), consolidated general government accounts, and increased fiscal accounts transparency and their provision to the Fund in line with the GFS classification. The authorities have already requested a technical assistance mission from the Fund’s Statistics Department to address the shortcomings in the balance of payments statistics, in particular in the capital account. They also hoped that the ongoing census would provide much needed information on various sectors. The staff recommends that the authorities consider participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), which could constitute a comprehensive framework within which further enhancement of macroeconomic statistics could be accomplished. III.   STAFF APPRAISAL 41.      Saudi Arabia has strengthened its macroeconomic position significantly through prudent macroeconomic management and efficient utilization of oil resources. Economic growth has been rapid, which combined with the oil-related terms-of-trade gains in the last two years, has contributed to boost per capita income by 25 percent and has strengthened medium-term prospects. The combined effect of surging oil and non-oil exports, rebounding domestic demand, and a booming stock market has created much optimism on the economic front. Large external current account and fiscal surpluses, a declining debt ratio and continued price stability have reinforced the foundation for more vibrant private sector-led non-oil economic activities. Notwithstanding these gains, the accentuating unemployment and rapidly growing Saudi labor force pose serious challenges and will require sustaining non-oil growth at full potential over the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 19 - medium term. Sustaining structural reforms, and accelerating them as appropriate, will be key to invigorating the non-oil growth and generating employment. 42.      Saudi Arabia has been playing an important and constructive role in ensuring oil market stability. The authorities’ efforts to meet growing global demand for oil by maintaining its production well above its OPEC quotas and by expanding its production capacity have helped in stabilizing the oil market, and also brought benefits for Saudi Arabia. The staff welcomes the authorities’ firm commitment to utilize its vast oil reserves and make necessary investments to increase further its output and production capacity, if global demand continues to remain strong. This policy is appropriate in the context of the prevailing volatile oil market environment, and is supportive of the ongoing global economic expansion. Expeditious implementation of the Gas Initiative will also help accelerate the fast growing petrochemical industry, expand the export base, and also release more oil for export. Saudi Arabia’s role in advancing international efforts in petroleum-related production and consumption data through its participation in the Joint Oil Data Initiative is commendable.  43.      The strong turnaround in the fiscal position has been facilitated by the authorities’ resolve to contain budgetary outlays. The authorities’ success in reducing nonsecurity current outlays and cutting subsidies for domestic wheat and barley producers bode well for improved resource allocation and the authorities’ fiscal consolidation and debt reduction strategy. The staff supports the authorities’ plan to use higher oil revenues for increases in health and education and infrastructure development and for a significant reduction of government debt. This balanced approach is appropriate and would enhance political support for sustainability of the ongoing fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy would need to be supported by fiscal reforms on both the expenditure and revenue sides and by improved budget management. The staff recommends a comprehensive civil service reform; continued privatization and corporatization to reduce the government payroll; continued progress in reducing the remaining subsidies and rationalizing transfers; and introduction of a VAT (in the context of the harmonized GCC tax structure) to ensure the fiscal consolidation and debt reduction envisaged under the medium-term fiscal projection. The staff is of the view that macroeconomic policy formulation and fiscal policy effectiveness would benefit from an analysis based on the general government operations. Budget management would also benefit from explicit information on oil revenues and their use. 44.      The Saudi banking system is financially sound, well managed, and effectively supervised. The establishment of a Capital Market Authority (CMA) under the new capital market law will also further strengthen management and operations of the stock market. Looking forward, the continued strong surge in stock prices, although backed by strong economic fundamentals, poses some risks to the financial system. In the fifth year of its ongoing bull run, the authorities need to be cautious about bank exposure to stock market-related lending and to consumer lending which may also be linked to stock-related activities. Expeditious adoption and implementation of regulations being prepared by the CMA would be important in alleviating concerns about the stock market. The staff encourages the authorities to implement the remaining FSAP recommendations to strengthen further the resilience of the Saudi financial Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 20 - systems and enhance its growth-promoting role. The staff believes that development of secondary markets in government bonds and primary and secondary markets in corporate bonds is the next order of business in further development of the financial sector.  45.      Prudent conduct of monetary policy has supported the exchange rate peg and contributed to a remarkable degree of price stability. The strong non-oil export growth and the recent depreciation of the riyal in real effective terms also indicate that competitiveness is not a problem. Nevertheless, with the envisioned move toward the GCC monetary union, the GCC authorities need to agree on an appropriate unified exchange regime. In this regard, staff supports the authorities’ intention to remain open toward the choice of the exchange rate regime under the planned monetary union. The staff notes the significant progress made towards free movement of goods, labor and capital among the GCC countries, and hopes that agreement would be reached in the near future on fiscal policy convergence criteria, integration of financial markets, and establishment of a common central bank. 46.      Generating employment for the fast growing Saudi labor force and reducing the prevailing high level of unemployment will continue to remain the most important economic challenge for Saudi Arabia. The staff endorses the authorities’ position to sustain the pace of structural reform to support non-oil economic expansion led by the private sector, as key to solving the unemployment problem. Sustaining the pace of reform in the midst of the oil revenue-induced boom will be a challenge. It is encouraging to note that progress continues to be made on institutional development and legislative reforms, broader private sector role in sectors previously dominated by the public sector, and labor market reforms aimed at skill development, flexible enforcement of Saudiization policy, and portability of pension benefits. The Human Development Fund, aimed at intensifying efforts to match skills with market demand, and the new labor law under consideration will contribute to this objective by providing greater flexibility in employer-employee relationship.  47.      Progress continues to be made in improving Saudi Arabia’s economic statistics. The staff concurs with the authorities that the priority needs are in the areas of balance of payments statistics and national accounts. The staff recommends that the authorities consider compilation of general government statistics, and participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), which could form the framework for a comprehensive approach to improve further its macroeconomic statistics. 48.

The TCP with the Kingdom, the Bank’s largest reimbursable non-lending country program, has been expanding for a number of years in terms of number of activities and diversity. This year’s program is approximately similar in size to the one for FY04 (11.5 staff years for a total of US$ 5.156 million, including staff years, overheads and Country Office costs). The Bank is having increasing involvement in more substantive and broader scope TA (comprehensive sector strategies with the Ministry of Water and Electricity, as well as broader scope work with the Public Investment Fund on the North-South Railway and with the Ministry of Health on the global assessment of health financing). The above activities plus our on-going TA to the electricity and telecoms regulators and the recently restructured Ministry of Communications and Information Technology now account for almost 65 percent of the total TA. 50.      Some of the important on-going activities in FY05 include: • Institutional Strengthening: The nascent regulators for the telecommunications, electricity, and industrial estates development (Communications and IT Commission; Saudi Electricity Regulatory Authority and Saudi Organization for Industrial Estates and Technology Zones, respectively), as well as the Ministry of Water and Electricity, the Supreme Commission for Tourism, and the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology.   • General Private Sector Development: Development of Industrial Estates; Industrial Sector Competitiveness Analysis; Technology Transfer and Diffusion, Expansion of Industrial Exports. • Privatization and PSP: Railway Network Expansion initiatives; privatization of the Grain Silos and Flour Mills Organization (GSFMO); and BOT for the new Hajj terminal in Jeddah. • General Reform Initiatives: Power Sector Restructuring and Regulation; Health Financing and Insurance; Investment Climate Assessment and Investment Promotion; Removal of Administrative Barriers; Environmental Strategy. • Water Sector Strategy and Action Plan. In January 2004, Bank organized a major workshop attended by over 200 people. This successful activity held over several days, constituted phase 1 of the action plan. Phase 2, launched in May 2004 to help develop a strategy with a timeline for all deliverables, and was organized as a retreat over several days as well.

Data on GDP, value added per sector at current and constant prices, and GDP deflators are available on an annual basis. The Central Department of Statistics (CDS) completed in 2002 several major surveys and censuses, which aimed at providing a more accurate picture of sectoral developments, household income and expenditures, and demographic and labor force developments. However, the agricultural data included in the national accounts, although re-based to 1999, continue to follow an outdated methodology, and the last agricultural census took place in 1981. Following the completion of the 1999 household and income expenditure survey, the CDS revised national accounts data for the period 1996–99 and 2000 on the expenditure side, based on the results of the survey, and adopted 1999 as a base year (against 1970 before) for the computation of aggregates in constant prices. On the production side, 2000 data are still estimated. For 2001, the establishment survey generated estimates for both expenditure and production. Those estimates will be finalized once oil sector data (exports and imports of oil and gas by quantity and value, intermediate consumption, and revenue and expenditures of companies in the oil sector) become available to the CDS. The building of a new base year is the first step in a global plan for transition from the 1968 System of National Accounts (1968 SNA) to 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). The objective of the CDS is to change all national accounts to the 1993 SNA by 2004. For that purpose, the CDS introduced questionnaires for its 1999 establishment expenditure survey so as to derive the information necessary to reconstruct the data according to the 1993 SNA. As a second step, the CDS published in September 2003 national accounts data for 1999 and 2000 following the 1993 SNA. 52.      The completion of the 1999 household expenditure and income survey enabled the CDS to construct a new CPI based on an updated basket (the current cost-of-living index is based on a basket dating back to 1985 in terms of items and weights). The new weights are currently being finalized. The compilation and the dissemination of the new index started in January 2003. It covers all 13 regions and all main cities within those regions, in addition to rural areas, and includes 420 goods and services (versus 180 for the previous index). 53.      The CDS initiated by end-2001 quarterly surveys on all sectors of activity except agriculture and it is to carry a general economic and population census including  all sectors and agents (public, private, agriculture, nonprofit, foreign companies, and households) in all cities (the 1993 census covered only private establishments, excluded agriculture, and covered only 158 cities). The population census already started on September 2004. Another project still on the drawing board is the general GCC population census of 2010. 54.      More recent progress in the implementation of surveys and censuses conducted and planned by the CDS are as follows: • The annual economic survey of establishments for 2000 was completed in May 2002.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public APPENDIX III  - 34 -• The 1999 manufacturing sector five-yearly census was completed. The next census, which will be part of the above-mentioned 2004 census, will cover all establishments. • The transportation sector census of 1998 was completed. The next census is expected to be conducted with the global census of 2004. • The annual household-based labor force survey for 2001 has been completed and the 2002 survey is being processed. • The five-yearly census for 2001 on establishment-based wages and salaries was completed and 2001 data on private sector wages for all activities were published on the web (see below).  • The agricultural sector census for 1999 was completed (by the Ministry of Agriculture) and the census-based data were published. The next census will be part of the 2004 global census.  • The annual demographic survey of 2000 was completed.  • The annual survey for the compilation of import and export price indices, which started in 2001, has been completed. 55.      The processed surveys will allow the publication of the national accounts statistics in accordance with the 1968 and 1993 SNA presentation in the forthcoming CDS annual report.  56.      The authorities have also developed databases on labor markets available for use by the regional labor offices. These databases were completed and a weekly report on unemployment has been prepared and sent to the Council of Ministers since 2003. 57.      The CDS established in July 2001 an internet website through which it started disseminating: (a) national accounts data for 1996–2001 (with the new base 1999); (b) population and labor force data for 2001; (c) private sector wages and salaries for 2001 for all activities; (d) all surveys from 1996 to 1999; (e) cost-of-living index; (f) exports and imports up to 2001; and (g) tables, definitions, and methodology. 58.      Coordination between the CDS, SAMA and the Ministry of Finance is well-established. The CDS collects data on imports and exports of merchandise, which are directly inputted into an on-line database shared with SAMA. There are also weekly coordination meetings between the CDS and SAMA’s research Department to settle outstanding data issues. With regard to the Ministry of Finance, the CDS receives data from the ministry on a regular basis and reclassifies them according to the SNA methodology, which differs from the aggregation used by the ministry for budgetary control purposes. In contrast to the above, there is no effective coordination between the CDS and the Ministry of Petroleum, except through the formal quarterly setting of the Data Committee which includes the CDS, Budget’s Final Accounts Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public APPENDIX III  - 35 -specialists, SAMA, and the Petroleum Ministry. Typically, oil and gas data are received by the CDS after a long lag following the end of the reference period. Fiscal sector 59.      During the consultation missions, the authorities provided detailed information on the operations of the central government, including the stock of the gross domestic debt, the distribution of government debt by holders, amortization payments, and the breakdown of the fiscal financing between bank and nonbank sources. In addition, statistical information is provided on the Saudi Fund for Development and some data on the PIF, as well as on four other lending institutions (Saudi Agricultural Bank, Saudi Credit Bank, Saudi Industrial Development Fund, and Real Estate Development Fund). However, although authorities have recently given consideration to the publishing of detailed fiscal data and presenting a consolidated public finances (central government, PIF, and AGIs), actual publication is yet to occur. 60.      Following recommendations by the September 1997 Fund technical assistance mission on fiscal accounts, the authorities are working to fully address remaining weaknesses in the fiscal data. As a first step, expenditure on wages and salaries has been reclassified to be fully captured in line with the UN System of National Accounts (SNA) methodology. However, there is no evidence of progress in compiling and reporting fiscal data in line with the Government Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) or in reporting data for the GFS Yearbook. The MOFNE is planning on using Government Finance Statistics (GFS) definitions to report its fiscal data in a format that is harmonized with 1993 SNA. Monetary data 61.      Most monetary and financial data are readily available in SAMA’s Monthly Statistical Bulletin, published with a lag of about one month and available since March 2000 on the SAMA website. In particular, commercial bank data are adequate and are provided on a regular basis. Information on deposit interest rates is included (and published on a daily basis in the national press), but not interest rates on government securities. Monetary data for SAMA are provided to the Fund on a monthly basis. More disaggregated data on SAMA’s liabilities are only provided during consultation missions. The timeliness of data, however, has improved starting with the April 2001 submission, when lags were reduced to one month. Information on aggregates related to the stock market and mutual fund transactions are available monthly on SAMA’s website.

The 1997 STA balance of payments (BOP) mission assisted the authorities in reclassifying the BOP data, and recommended new collection methods that would allow SAMA to compile the balance of payments consistent with to the methodology of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) within a relatively short period. In January/February 2001, a STA mission conducting a training seminar in Riyadh, assisted authorities in reclassifying the BOP statistics in BPM5 and provided additional technical assistance on key quality, coverage and classification issues. However, the data are not yet disseminated according to BPM5. Only the major items of the balance of payments are presently reported, and a limited breakdown is provided. The authorities informed STA in December 2003 that they started the compilation of the BOP statistics according to the BPM5 methodology. In response to a request from the authorities, a STA mission had been scheduled to visit Riyadh in May 2004 to evaluate the implementation of the.BPM5 methodology; the mission was, however, postponed due to the security situation in Riyadh. The intention is that the STA mission will resume upon improvement of the security situation in Riyadh. The SAMA publishes the BOP on an annual basis.

Data provided to the consultation missions are available in the Fund documents and intended for internal circulation only. The authorities issued in May 2001 a directive requiring departments and ministries to publish relevant data, including information on GDP and other vital statistics on a regular basis. As a result of the new directive, a Data Committee was established in 2002, including the CDS, Budget’s Final Accounts specialists, SAMA, and the Petroleum Ministry. The Committee meets in principle on a quarterly basis to discuss data issues and decide about the publication of quarterly data.
