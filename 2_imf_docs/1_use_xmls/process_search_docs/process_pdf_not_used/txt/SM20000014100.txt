Serious disruptions in government services as a result of wage arrears and continuing political turmoil prevented the completion of Article IV consultation discussions in 1998 and 1999. In April 1999, the military took power in a coup d’etat; since then, a number of political parties have joined the government, and government services have improved. However, the conflict with the separatist island of Anjouan, which unilaterally declared independence in 1997, is unresolved, and this island remains outside control of the central government. l Reflecting the unstable political environment and fiscal problems, the economy con- tinued to contract, and real GDP is estimated to have declined by 0.5 percent in 1998 and 1.4 percent in 1999. The Comoros is a member of the French franc zone, and with a stable exchange rate, inflation remained at about 3-4 percent per year in the last two years. The current account of the balance of payments (including grants) improved from a deficit of 9.4 percent in 1997 to virtual balance in 1999 as an increase in transfers from the Comorian community living abroad more than offset a sharp decline in official grants. However, net capital outflows increased and gross official reserves declined by US$5 million from 5.5 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services in 1997 to 6.1 months at end-1999. l The fiscal situation remains weak, mainly because of high expenditures on wages. The fiscal pressures have resulted in large arrears to suppliers, a stock of wage arrears amounting to almost twice the annual wage bill at end-1999, and external debt arrears amounting to US$53 million, 1.4 times the level of gross reserves. The government cleared its arrears to the World Bank at end-1999, allowing a resumption of the latter’s lending activities, mainly in the social sectors, but arrears to other multilateral and bilateral creditors increased further. l Despite a projected increase in revenues to 16 percent of GDP, as a result of tax measures implemented in the second half of 1999, the draft budget for 2000 showed a financing requirement of about 5.4 percent of GDP. The authorities agreed that the expenditure plans would have to be reduced, but whereas the staff recommended a wage cut, they preferred a reduction in employment, which, however, would require time. They also indicated that, whereas they intended to clear some of the domestic arrears to sup- pliers and avoid new wage arrears, further accumulation of external arrears would be likely. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- Issues raised in staff appraisal l The staff emphasized that, in order to improve growth and reduce poverty and reduce dependence on volatile transfers from abroad, the Comoros should implement a medium-term stabilization and structural adjustment program within the context of a stable political environment, which will focus on revenue measures, expenditure cuts, and structural reforms. Stabilization policies will need to focus on addressing the fiscal problems, mainly overstaffing. l With regard to structural reform, the government should make rapid progress with restructuring and privatizing the state-owned corporations. This will increase the efficiency of the economy, and improve the Comoros’ competitiveness. l Given the large balance of payments and budgetary imbalance, the staff noted that a normalization of relationships with external creditors will require significant excep- tional external support, including debt rescheduling.

At that time, Directors stressed the need for strengthening fiscal policy and decreasing the government wage bill, and for implementing structural reforms aimed at restoring com- petitiveness, giving a high priority to the privatization of public enterprises. Although the Comoros is on a 12-month consultation cycle, the 1998 Article IV consultation discussions could not be completed, as low morale arising from the accumulation of wage arrears resulted in disruptions in government services and serious difficulties in obtaining the necessary information. Because of continuing political turmoil in 1999, no further consultations could be held that year. During the 1999 Annual Meetings, the Comorian representatives requested a mission to assess the new administration’s efforts to improve the public finances. In response, a staff team visited Moroni during February 26-March 10,2000, to collect information on recent developments, to conduct the 2000 Article IV consultation discussions, and to assist the authorities in preparing the budget for 2000.’ The Comoros accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, effective June 1, 1996. 2. The Comorian database remains seriously deficient, complicating the formula- tion and monitoring of economic and financial policies, although the situation has improved since end-1998. The authorities continue to provide the Fund monetary statistics on a monthly basis. The recording of fiscal data has also improved, but the institutional setup to compile regular, comprehensive overviews of budgetary developments is weak, and such information is only available on an ad hoc basis and with considerable effort. Data on the financial operations of the public enterprises lack transparency and timeliness. The national accounts and the consumer price statistics contain serious methodological errors and are inadequate. In the external sector, the balance of payments is compiled only annually and with a considerable lag, data on capital account flows remain sketchy, and the external debt database has not been maintained since 1994. II. RECENT DEVELOPING Am PROSPECTS 3. Since gaining its independence in 1975, the Comoros has had great diffkulties in establishing a stable political environment, and there have been many coup attempts, hindering the formulation and implementation of consistent longer-term economic policies. Following the chaotic political situation precipitated by the death of President Taki ’ The mission, which included Messrs. Harry Snoek (head), Bemadin Akitoby, and Dominique Guillaume (all AFR), met Mr. Sououndi Abdou Toybou, the Minister of Finance, Budget, and Planning; Mr. SaYd Ahmed SaYd Ali, the Governor of the Central Bank of the Comoros; other senior government officials; and representatives of public enterprises, the commercial bank, and donor agencies. Mr. Snoek also met with Colonel Assoumani Azali, the Head of State. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- in November 1998, which was compounded by the separatist endeavor of Anjouan (see Box l), a new government, led by Colonel Assoumani Azali, took power in April 1999 in a coup d’etat. The government now includes a number of political parties; however, the elections initially scheduled for April 2000 have been postponed for a two-year period. The conflict with Anjouan remains unresolved, and a recent coup attempt illustrates the continuing fragility of the political situation in the Comoros. Box 1. Comoros: Background Information on the Economy and the Anjouan Crisis The Islamic Republic of the Comoros consists of three subtropical islands-the Grande Comore, Anjouan, and MohCli-in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and the coast of Mozambique. The population is about 550,000. The islands became independent in 1975, at which time a fourth island, Mayotte, elected to stay a part of France. The main export products are vanilla, cloves, and ylang-ylang, and the majority of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture. Fishery and tourism remain underdeveloped. Real GDP growth has remained negative since 1994. GDP per capita was estimated at US$349 in 1999. Because of its geographic position, its small size, and the inefficiency of its government- owned utilities, the Comoros has among the highest transport and energy prices in the world. The economy is highly dependent upon transfers from the large Comorian community living abroad-mainly in France- estimated to number between 100,000 and 150,000. Separatists on the island of Anjouan declared independence in 1997; however, this has not been recognized by any country or international organization. In April 1999, a conference organized under the aegis of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to resolve the crisis was held in Madagascar, in which separatists were represented. However, the leaders of Anjouan have refused to sign the peace agreement. In December 1999, the OAU threatened Anjouan with a trade embargo, starting in February 2000, but this embargo has not been enforced outside the Comoros because it has not been ratified by the United Nations. The.federal government does not receive any statistical information from Anjouan, and there are insufficient data to assess the impact of the separation of Anjouan on the economy of the Comoros. Anjouan remains outside the control of the federal government, and the federal budget has no transactions with the island (the direct impact on the federal budget is positive as transfers to Anjouan-mainly to pay civil servants-generally exceed revenues collected on the island). Anjouan is the main exporter of ylang-ylang, but part of its exports-and imports--continue to be channeled through the island of Grande Comore; since the second half of 1998, the balance of payments captures only this part of Anjouan’s imports and exnorts. 4. The Comoros is part of the French franc zone, and the Comorian franc (CF) is pegged to the French franc at a fixed rate of CF l= F 0.013 (F l= CF 75). On January 12, 1994, when the other currencies of the franc zone devalued by 50 percent in foreign currency terms, the CF devalued by 30 percent in foreign currency terms. Since January 1, 1999, the - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- exchange rate of the Comorian franc has been implicitly fixed at CF 1 = EUR 0.00198. The devaluation of 1994 has not significantly improved commodity exports because it has not been supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies and the implementation of necessary structural reforms. Consequently, the gains in competitiveness attained in 1994 were eroded, and the economy has retained a structure of relatively high production costs. In the period 1994-99, while the nominal effective exchange rate remained broadly stable, the real effective exchange rate (based on the relative consumer price index) appreciated by about 19 percent in 1995, reflecting higher inflation, but remained relatively stable thereafter (see Figure 1). 5. Since 1998, the Comorian economy has continued to contract, reflecting the impact of political and fiscal problems, inefficient public enterprises, and increasing competition in its export markets. Indications are that real GDP declined by 0.5 percent in 1998 and by 1.4 percent in 1999, although living standards in the Grande Comore were partly protected by increasing transfers from the Comorian community living overseas (Table l).* Export crops benefited from unusually high prices for cloves in 1999, but production for the domestic market contracted significantly in 1998 and 1999 as a result of the uncertainty brought about by the chaotic political situation and the accumulation of budgetary wage arrears. The latter led to continuous strikes and the irregular provision of public services. While foreign-financed investments in the power generation network and in the extension of the storage capacity of the oil import company boosted investments in 1998 and 1999, that effect was offset in 1999 by the interruption of projects financed by the World Bank following the accumulation of debt-payment arrears to this institution. Essential infrastructure investments, such as revamping the tarmac of the runway of the only intema- tional airport, continued to be deferred. Inflation in 1998-99 remained at about 3-4 percent per year, partly driven by increases in food prices resulting from the contraction of the local production. Broad money and credit to the private sector increased by only 4 percent during the last two years, the latter mostly in relation to rice import financing (Table 2). 6. Although the fiscal situation improved in 1999 following a sharp deterioration in 1998, it remained fundamentally weak and the government continued to accumulate large arrears, especially on external debt (Table 3). In 1998, the deficit after grants increased to 4.2 percent of GDP, up from 2.4 percent of GDP in 1997, because revenues declined much faster than expenditures (Box 2). In 1999, the deficit declined by 3.5 per- centage points to 0.7 percent of GDP, largely because of a fall of 2 percentage points in foreign-financed capital expenditure. This decline was mainly due to the suspension of World Bank assistance following debt-service arrears and, to a much lesser extent, to revenue-raising measures. The overall financing need-including amortization due on foreign debt of about 4-5 percent of GDP annually-increased sharply in 1998 but declined * Private transfers remain largely outside the formal system. Transfers are recorded under travel as well as under private transfer in the balance of payments. Officially recorded transfers increased by 82 percent from 1997 to 1999.

In particular, in 1999, virtually the entire financing need was met by incurring arrears. At end-1999, the stock of wage arrears amounted to CF 11.6 billion (13.0 percent of GDP, or almost twice the annual wage bill), up from CF 6.2 billion at end- 1997, and in 1998 and 1999 only 13 percent of external debt-service obligations, consisting of obligations to the World Bank and the Fund, were actually paid. At end-1999 the stock of external arrears stood at US$53 million, up from US!!40 million at end-1997. 7. Following an effort to improve revenue performance, revenues (including grants) increased by 9.6 percent in 1999, compared with a decline of 17.3 percent in 1998. The latter reflected the difficult political environment and the accumulation of budgetary wage arrears, which led to disruptions in tax collection (tax revenue declined by more than 22 percent) and a reduction in donors’ support. Hence, in May 1999, the new government implemented a number of measures amounting to a revenue effort equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP. These measures included stricter enforcement of tax compliance, inten- sified collaboration with the import inspection company, an increase in the sales tax from 7 percent to 10 percent, and an increase in the tax on alcohol and tobacco from 150 percent to 180 percent. 8. Current expenditure decreased by 9.1 percent in 1998 as a result of the halt in wage payments to Anjouan in the second half of the year and the sharp decrease in technical assistance outlays. Despite the exclusion of Anjouan from the wage bill, current expendi- ture rose by 3.6 percent in 1999, as an effort to return to the normal functioning of government services led to a sharp increase in expenditure on goods and services. Capital expenditure increased by 36 percent in 1998, mainly as a result of foreign-financed investment in the power-generating network, but declined to its 1997 level by 1999 as donor support declined. 9. The conduct of monetary policy by the Central Bank of the Comoros (Banque Centrale des Comore-BCC) is largely limited by the membership of the Comoros in the French franc zone system and the related institutional arrangements, as well as by the existence of only one commercial bank (Banque pour I’Industrie et le Commerce- BIC). In the absence of competition, interest rates were set by the BCC until January 1, 2000; since then, they have been indexed on the Euro interbank rate. In recent years, foreign 3 Owing to the disruptions in government services, fiscal accounting deteriorated, and the data provided for 1998 are estimates with considerable margins of error. This situation is also reflected in the large discrepancy between the overall deficit and the financing estimates, amounting to 3.1 percent of GDP. This discrepancy could be due to unrecorded expenditures or overestimated financing. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. -9- Box 2.

The financial system of the Comoros remains underdeveloped. Although there are no barriers to market entry, there is only one commercial bank in the Comoros, which focuses exclusively on short-term commercial lending. The Development Bank of the Comoros (Banque de Developpement des Comore-BDC), which was the traditional provider of medium- and long-term project financing, stopped new lending operations in November 1997 because of the accumulation of nonperforming loans and liquidity problems; the BDC is being restructured with donor assistance. Two systems of microfinance-the SANDUK and the MECK-have been expanding rapidly over the last three years. Their combined credit portfolio has increased to about 38 percent of that of the BDC and 8 percent of the BIC. With Fund technical assistance, the BCC is improving bank supervision; however, the microfinance institutions-which have an average recovery rate as high as 88 percent-have not yet been officially recognized as financial institutions and are not being supervised. The lack of competition in the financial system has led to very high intermediation costs; as a result, a large share of private transfers has been entering the country through informal channels. 11. The current account of the balance of payments (including grants) improved from a deficit of 9.4 percent of GDP in 1997 to virtual balance in 1999, as a 37 percent increase in private transfers from the Comorian community living abroad more than offset a sharp decline in official grants. The latter followed the suspension of donor assistance, which, in turn, reflected the unsettled political situation and the accumulation of debt-service arrears (Table 4). The foreign trade deficit narrowed from 21.8 percent of GDP in 1997 to 18.4 percent of GDP in 1998, as imports decreased by 11 percent with the weakening of economic activity. The trade balance improved further in 1999, with the deficit narrowing to 18.3 percent of GDP as exports increased more rapidly than imports. The increase of 6.5 per- cent in imports, triggered by the rise in transfers and the recovery in economic activity in the second half of 1999, was more than offset by the 40 percent expansion in exports in that year generated by larger volumes of vanilla exports and a peak in cloves prices. Although net capital outflows were large, gross official reserves increased slightly from 5.5 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services in 1997 to 6.1 months at end-1999. 12. The stock of debt-service arrears increased further from US$39.7 million at end- 1997 to US$52.7 million at end-1999 (1.4 times the level of reserves). Arrears to multi- lateral creditors (mainly the African Development Bank and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa) amounted to US$36.3 million and arrears to bilateral creditors (mainly the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development and the Saudi Fund for Develop- ment) were US$16.4 million at the end-1999 (Table 5). 13. Not much progress was made on structural reforms in recent years. As part of their efforts to restore normalcy and improve efficiency, the authorities outlined a detailed reform agenda for the government administration in May 1999. However, despite quarterly - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- reviews, little has been achieved so far. Reflecting the difficult political situation, the privati- zation program of public enterprises came to a virtual standstill in 1998 and 1999, and, in the case of the rice import company, previous reforms were reversed as it abandoned the use of competitive bidding for its procurement. 14. There are no detailed data available to measure the recent poverty level in the country and on each island. The decline in economic growth has lowered real per capita income by an average of 3 percent per year since 1997. Education has been disrupted due to the wage arrears and strikes in recent years. Although that situation has been partly offset on Grande Comore by an increase of 52 percent in transfers between 1997 and 1999, per capita income remains low. Anjouan does not receive such transfers, and health is reported to deteriorate rapidly, with over 2,000 cases of cholera reported versus 100 cases on the Grande Comore. Key social indicators are presented in Table 6. 15. The economy is not expected to improve in 2000. No new investment projects are planned, and, in the absence of major progress in public enterprise reform, domestic activity is expected to increase only slightly, by 0.5 percent, Inflation is expected to rise to 4.5 per- cent, as higher oil import prices have already been translated into higher domestic energy prices. The external current account is projected to switch to a deficit of about 2.8 percent of GDP because exports are expected to decrease by 8 percent, as the price of cloves returns to its normal level, and imports are expected to increase by 5 percent, owing to larger rice im- ports. However, the deficit on the capital account-assuming that the scheduled debt service due is actually paid-is expected to be smaller than in 1999 because of the resumption of World Bank operations. Reflecting these developments, official reserves are expected to decrease to 4.5 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services by end-2000. III. REPORTONPOLICYDISCU~~IONS 16. Against the background of limited growth expected in 2000, serious budgetary im- balances, and a deteriorating external situation, the discussions with the authorities focused on the need to adopt policies that would contain financial imbalances, improve competitive- ness, and contribute to restore confidence. Particular attention was given to the need to im- prove rapidly the budgetary situation and to cut overall costs in the economy, given the fixed exchange regime. A. Fiscal Policy 17. Under the draft budget for 2000: the fiscal deficit (including grants) is expected to widen substantially (to 2.4 percent of GDP) because government spending is budgeted to rise much faster than revenues. The planned deficit and the amortization obligations 4 The final version of the budget for 2000, which was adopted by the State Council on April 25,2000, was only marginally different from the version discussed by the mission.

Revenues are projected to increase by 19 percent in 2000 to 15.5 percent of GDP (slightly above the 1997 outcome) on the basis of a continuation of the tax collection effort started in the second half of 1999 and larger projected import volumes of rice.‘*6 The staff agreed with the authorities that, after the increases in 1999, there was little scope at this time for further adjustments in tax rates. The government has continued to authorize the inspec- tion of customs by an independent company and is considering reducing exemptions. The Ministry of Finance is also considering replacing the sales tax by a value-added tax (VAT). 19. With regard to expenditure, the authorities intend to accord a high priority to social sector expenditure. Although the previous budget provided for a “safety net” cover- ing primary education and basic health care, expenditures on education and health were executed on average at about 50 percent of the budgeted amount, mostly to pay wages and salaries. The rate of execution of nonwage expenditures in the social sectors was even lower at about 25-30 percent. However, the government is making an effort to improve social expenditures in the 2000 budget. Thus, the share of expenditure for health is budgeted to increase from 4 percent in 1999 to 6 percent in 2000,’ and the share for education is expected to rise from 16 percent to 17 percent. Expenditure on goods and services is planned to increase by 8 percent in 2000, in order to allow the administration to function properly. The authorities also intend to avoid further wage arrears, and to repay the existing atreams The budget includes provisions for the payment of the two months of civil service wage arrears that accumulated in 1999, which is deemed essential for ensuring social peace,’ provisions are also made for the payment of arrears to utility companies. 20. Given the large uncovered financing need of CF 5 billion for 2000, equivalent to about one third of projected revenues, or 5.4 percent of GDP, the discussions with the 5 To allow for the potential resolution of the conflict with Anjouan, the budget includes revenue from, and expenditures for, Anjouan for the second half of 2000. The authorities agreed that these budget lines should be frozen as long as no solution to the political crisis had been found. 6 A rice shipment arrived in Moroni in December 1999 but did not go through customs until January 2000. ’ Health facilities are now largely managed by local communities. ’ The arrears repayment would take the form of a reduction of the claims of enterprises on the treasury recorded in the treasury accounts. 9 Wages were not paid in November and December 1999 in order to reimburse arrears to the World Bank.

They agreed that cuts were necessary and could be made in expenditures on goods and services without endan- gering the allocation for the social sectors. More important, since the main public finance problem in the Comoros is the very large share of revenue that is spent on personnel costs, the authorities agreed that the wage bill needs to be reduced substantially. While the ratio of expenditure on wages and salaries to domestic revenues declined from 66 percent in 1997 to 53 percent in 1999, it was mostly due to the exclusion of payments for salaries to civil ser- vants stationed on Anjouan, and did not reflect cuts in indemnities and various allowances. Efforts to reduce the workforce in recent years have so far failed, and the size of the nonmilitary civil service remains at about 6,200. Although the mission proposed a com- bination of wage cuts and reductions in staff, the authorities stated that wage cuts might lead to further unrest, and suggested that the needed reduction would have to be achieved entirely by reducing staffing levels; they also noted that this might take some time. 21. Assuming no net expenditures on Anjouan, and identified savings in expenditures on wages and goods and services of about 3.7 percent of GDP, the remaining gap for 2000 would be CF 1 billion, or 1 percent of GDP. In the absence of additional external financing, which is likely to be forthcoming only in the context of a comprehensive adjustment pro- gram, and once political stability has been restored, further increases in bilateral and multi- lateral debt-service arrears appear, at present, to be unavoidable. 22. In view of the serious fiscal problems, the authorities agreed with the staffs recommendation that fiscal management and monitoring should be strengthened. Possible measures in this area include the reestablishment of the previous Structural Adjust- ment Program Monitoring Committee, the implementation of a strict monthly cash-control system, the strengthening of the accounting department, and the computerization of the treasury and tax departments. Furthermore, the authorities agreed that all expenditure should be channeled though the treasury, and that the Minister of Finance should be the sole authority to contract new foreign debt and have the final approval on new recruitment. The authorities are considering requesting technical assistance in these areas. B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy and the Banking System 23. The monetary policy will continue to be geared to preserve the exchange rate peg and to maintain an adequate level of external reserves. Credit to the government will continue to be contained within the statutory limit. With money supply projected to increase in 2000 by 4 percent, broadly in line with nominal GDP, the monetary program will permit an adequate growth in credit to the economy to support the needs of the private sector. The authorities will continue to pursue a flexible interest rate policy, maintaining a positive differential with the rate prevailing in the euro zone. 24. In the banking sector, the BCC has made progress in establishing prudential regulations for the financial system, following Fund technical assistance, and it intends to make further improvements after a follow-up visit from the technical assistance expert. The authorities agreed that they should play an active role to minimize the costs to - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- the economy of the monopolistic position of the BIC; however, they pointed to the special difficulties facing the Comoros because there was only one commercial bank, in the absence of which the country would be completely without commercial banking services. With the restoration of political and economic stability, prospects would improve for the entry into operation of additional banks, thereby enhancing competition in this sector. C. Trade and Regional Integration Policies 25. The tariff structure presently consists of three nonzero rates (20,30, and 40 percent) with an average tariff rate of about 30 percent. The authorities have granted to the partner countries in the Indian Ocean Commission a preferential rate on a reciprocal basis, reducing duties by 80 percent, effective in early 1999, and they intend to provide a 100 percent tariff reduction, effective end-2000. The authorities have reviewed the proposed harmonized external tariff of the Cross-Border Initiative, and noted that its introduction would lead to substantial revenue losses, requiring a complete overhaul of domestic taxation. 26. The authorities continue to be committed to the key objectives of the Cross- Border Initiative. Accordingly, they have taken measures in 1999 to eliminate nontariff barriers” and import licenses; they have also simplified regulations concerning investment, related tax benefits, and immigration laws. D. Structural and Social Issues 27. The discussion centered on measures needed to increase the efficiency of the economy. The staff stressed that, given the fixed exchange rate regime, policy measures should focus on lowering the cost of public utilities and other essential services, such as transport. The authorities concurred with this view and indicated that in addition to imple- menting a very prudent wage policy, they intend now to focus on the resumption of the privatization of the public utilities and other key companies. 28. The staff stressed the importance of implementing reforms that aimed at promoting private sector development. In this context, the authorities were urged to expedite the privatization program, and to focus not only on privatizing the management of public enterprises, but also on complete divestiture. The authorities noted that, in trying to do so, they would need to carefully assess the alternative modalities for privatization and the pros- pects for external assistance to cover labor retrenchment costs. The staff also encouraged the authorities to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework, including the commercial and labor codes, with a view to supporting the development of the private sector. 29. The staff urged the authorities to set the stage for the privatization process by evaluat- ing the assets of the oil-importing company (Societe Comorienne d’Hydrocarbures-SCH), I0 Except for rice and petroleum products, which remain an import monopoly, managed by state companies.

The staff noted the difficulty of renegotiating the contract under which the country’s telephone code was partly leased to a foreign company, and that company’s preemptive right under the current contract in case of the privatization of the telecommunications company (SociCtC Nationale des Pastes et TClCcommunications-SNPT). The staff also welcomed the decision to implement the split of the postal services from telecommunications activities before the end of 2000. 30. To address the poverty issues, the government is preparing a poverty reduction program in close consultation with the UNDP, the World Bank, and the European Union, as part of the overall national program for reconstruction and national reconciliation. The program has been finalized, and the authorities are in the process of searching for adequate financing. It includes priority actions and investments in the key social sectors (water supply, health, education, and rural and community development), as well as measures to tackle youth and unemployment issues through the development of traditional activities and expan- sion of sources of income for the poor in the fishing and agriculture sectors. Provided the Comoros would implement in a satisfactory manner a program that could be supported by a Fund arrangement, the country could in due course become eligible for assistance under the HIPC Initiative. E. Statistical Issues 31. Compared with end-1998, the availability of economic data has much improved. However, the quality of most data is poor, as deficiencies in source data have been com- pounded by inappropriate classification of transactions. The staff encouraged the authorities to ensure adequate staffing and other resources in the statistical agencies, shortages of which have been an impediment to sustaining the impact of previous technical assistance. Further technical assistance to complement the efforts of the authorities would be necessary, es- pecially in the area of national accounts and the consumer price index. The staff also stressed the need to update the external debt data on a loan-by-loan basis, and to monitor and record all new foreign borrowing. The BCC is preparing a new reporting system to allow the com- pilation of monthly balance of payments data on a cash basis, which is expected to improve greatly the timeliness of data on external transactions. The authorities agreed to restart the regular reporting to the Fund of all major macroeconomic data, including on the fiscal situation. IV. THEMEDIUM-TERMOUTLOOKOFTHEBALANCEOFPAYMENTS 32. The medium-term balance of payments projection shows a sizable financing gap. The projections assume a return to normal production activity by 200 1, a target for the minimum level of gross official reserves of equivalent to four months of imports of goods and non- factor services, a stabilization in private transfers in 2000 after the rapid increase in 1998- 1999, no increase in real terms of project loans or project grants in the absence of a program with the Fund, and no l?uther accumulation of external arrears from 2000 onward. Under these conditions, the financing need over the next five years is equivalent to about 80 percent - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- of external debt service obligations, or about 3 percent of GDP. In the past, the Comoros has been able to maintain its external reserves by accumulating substantial external debt arrears. In the period ahead, in order to normalize external debt relationships, it will be necessary for the Comoros to obtain exceptional external financing, including debt rescheduling. V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 33. The economy of the Comoros is continuing to experience very difficult times. Real GDP has declined virtually every year since 1993, for a total decline of 10 percent. Competi- tion in its traditional export markets is increasing, and little progress has been made in developing alternative activities. As a result, living standards have become more and more dependent on transfers from family members living abroad. The fiscal situation was prob- lematic throughout much of the 1990s. Although, at 14- 15 percent of GDP, revenues (ex- cluding grants) are not excessively low, they have always been surpassed by expenditures, especially on wages and salaries. The institutional arrangements of the French franc zone prevent monetary financing of the deficit, thus protecting reserves and containing inflation, but domestic and external arrears are mounting, leading to disruptions in government ser- vices and in relations with donors, and, thus, to declines in new external financing. Although part of the economic problems of the Comoros is caused by a deteriorating external environment, the main cause is the lack of stabilization and adjustment policies, which is compounded by political instability, including from the separatist movement on Anjouan. 34. The present government has stated that it intends to address the problems. The reform agenda published in May 1999 focuses on the budget and the government administration, and the authorities also want to make progress in privatizing the state-owned corporations. Since taking office, the government has implemented measures to strengthen fiscal discipline and economic management. As a result, the functioning of the government has improved, and arrears in the debt-service payments to the World Bank were settled in January 2000. This allowed the Bank to resume project activities in the Comoros, in particular in the priority social sectors. Nevertheless, little progress was made in addressing the core problem of the budget-the overstaffing-and in restructuring and privatizing the state-owned corporations. Unless the fiscal position is strengthened considerably, further arrears accu- mulation to bilateral and multilateral creditors would be unavoidable. A greatly strengthened fiscal policy, and significant external support, including debt rescheduling, would be needed to allow the authorities to clear all remaining arrears and ensure that no new arrears are accumulated. 35. With regard to the budget, the authorities can be commended for the recent measures taken to increase revenues. However, the government should also make progress in reducing exemptions. Furthermore, while a planned reduction in staffing levels is the best long- term solution for the problem of the excessive wage bill, the authorities should also consider a general wage cut, which would need to take effect immediately and may be more acceptable to civil servants than the continuing uncertainty about payment of wages.

The statistical database remains weak and the staff urges the authorities to give high priority to improving the collection and methodology of core macroeconomic statistics, and to strengthen the relevant institutions. While monetary data are provided in a timely manner, there are some delays in receiving budgetary data, but this does not impede the ability to carry out surveillance. 37. Given the fmed exchange rate regime that has served the country well in the past, it is important that the authorities pursue with determination a policy aimed at improving effkiency and reducing the costs of production. Thus, the staff urges the authorities to accelerate the privatization program and strengthen the regulatory and legal framework, including the commercial and labor codes. In addition, a strengthening of the banking system and financial intermediation, including the reinforcement of the rural credit networks within the regulatory framework of the banking sector, would play a key role in channeling savings, including private transfers from abroad, into productive investments. 38. The staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation with Comoros be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

In the face of difficult country circumstances, the Bank has continued to help the Comoros improve economic and social conditions on all the islands and to work with the international community to support the country’s efforts to reach national reconciliation through a stronger economy and better governance. Critical elements of this strategy include the need for the government to continue to strengthen fiscal discipline, restore private sector confidence, and successfully execute projects to provide basic social services and infrastructure to the poor on all the three islands. 2. Specifically, the Bank has responded to the recent island crisis by expanding project assistance to help restore equitable living conditions across the islands through the provision of services and income opportunities for the poor and by increasingly involving communities in project implementation. Following the Country Portfolio Performance Review in March 2000, the Bank has restructured projects to increase the focus on community-based activities and reallocate resources to finance priority actions to meet the urgent need of the country. At present, the Bank has six projects under implementation (with total undisbursed balances of US$8.5 million) supporting social and productive sectors, i.e., education, health, social funds; private sector development; and agriculture services.

Although the situation has improved since end-1998, the database in the Comoros remains seriously deficient in all the sectors, complicating the formulation and monitoring of economic and financial policies. The situation has been compounded in recent years by disruptions in the civil service, and staffing inadequacies. In view of these difficulties, considerable work is required to improve the statistical base. National accounts data and prices 2. The main aggregates of the national accounts for 1986-1989, as well as the accounts for 1990 and rough estimates for 199 1 - 1993 were prepared by the World Bank, and the UNDP has assisted with the preparation of the accounts for 1994 and 1995. Thereafter, the national accounts were computed using extrapolations, and present serious methodological errors. There is little specific information on the level of economic activity, which complicates the formulation of sectoral policies. In addition, no comprehensive consumer price index was compiled during 1990 and 1991. The Statistics Department of the Ministry of Planning resumed price surveys in 1992. An AFRISTAT mission in 1998 has suggested to update the consumer basket using a 1995 household survey; however, recent developments in the Comoros have seriously outdated this survey, and the reference prices used in the price index are largely unrepresentative. Fiscal data 3. In the public finance sector, data are now presented on both a commitment and cash basis, but the identification and monitoring of domestic arrears remain difficult. The institutional setup to compile regular, comprehensive overviews of budgetary developments is weak, and such information is only available on ad hoc basis and with considerable effort. Data on the financial operations of public enterprises lack transparency and timeliness. Monetary data 4. Monetary data to the International Financial Statistics are received with a four-month lag. In 1997, a STA mission to the Comoros reviewed the compilation and reporting of money and banking statistics, and made several recommendations to improve classification, coverage and reporting procedures. Due to serious differences and errors in classification, IFS and central bank data differed significantly for major monetary aggregates prior to 1997. Balance of payments 5. The latest balance of payments data available to STA pertain to 199 1. Balance of payments data are prepared by the central bank with considerable delay.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Comoros On July 12, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Comoros.’ Background After having been interrupted for two years, Article IV consultation discussions with Comoros have now resumed. The Article IV consultations could not be held in 1998-l 999, because of disruptions in government services and continuing political turmoil, including the conflict with the separatist movement on the island of Anjouan. While the latter conflict has not yet been resolved and Anjouan remains outside the control of the Federal Government, government services are now again functioning normally. Reflecting this unstable political environment, as well as fiscal problems and increasing competition in export markets, the economy continued to contract in 1998-1999. Real GDP is estimated to have declined by 0.5 percent in 1998 and 1.4 percent in 1999, although living standards in the Grande Comore were partly protected by increasing transfers from the Comorian community living overseas. The Comoros is a member of the French Franc Zone and under its fixed exchange rate regime inflation was kept at 3-4 percent per year in 1998-l 999. Although the fiscal situation improved in 1999 following a sharp deterioration in 1998, it remained fundamentally weak, especially because of the high ratio of expenditure on wages and salaries to domestic revenues (53 percent in 1999). The deficit after grants declined from 4.2 percent of GDP in 1998 to 0.7 percent of GDP in 1999, largely because of a fall in foreign- financed capital expenditure; the deficits in 1998 and 1999 were mainly financed by a further ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

Nevertheless, is was able to clear debt service arrears to the World Bank, and the latter’s lending operations were resumed in early 2000. Reflecting the decline in economic activity, broad money and credit to the economy increased by only about 4 percent during the last two years. On January 1, 2000, the Central Bank of the Comoros introduced a flexible interest rate policy, linking rates for the single commercial bank to those prevailing in the Euro zone. The current account of the balance of payments (including grants) improved from a deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 1997 to virtual balance in 1999, as a 37 percent increase in private transfers from the Comorian community living abroad more than offset a sharp decline in official grants, that followed the suspension of donor assistance. Gross official reserves decreased from 6.6 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services in 1997 to 6.1 months at end-l 999. Executive Board Assessment [Summing-up] Public hformafion Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF’s assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
