Deppler and Susan Schadler April 5, 1995 I. Introduction Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation and the second review of the current stand-by arrangement (SBA) were conducted in Ankara and Istanbul during December 6-21, 1994 and February 7-17, 1995. The staff team met with the State Minister for the Economy, the Undersecretaries of the Treasury, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Planning Office, the Governor of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT), and other senior officials. u Additional discussions with Turkish officials took place in Washington in January 1995. The 1993 Article IV consultation was concluded on April 8, 1994 (EBM/94/82), when Executive Directors expressed concern over the deteriorating macroeconomic situation and called for a comprehensive reorientation of economic policy, led by a durable fiscal retrenchment. On July 8, 1994, the Executive Board approved a 14-month SBA for Turkey in an amount equivalent to SDR 509.3 million (68 percent of quota on an annual basis). The first review of the program was concluded by the Executive Board on November 18, 1994; on that occasion, Directors welcomed the progress made in meeting ambitious fiscal targets, but cautioned that failure to implement structural reforms could undermine the progress made in the adjustment effort. Several Directors noted the case for using a nominal 1/ Messrs. Reichmann (Head) and Nolan (both EUl), Figliuoli (FAD), and Wajid (PDR) participated in both missions.

As indicated in the letter dated March 7, 1995 from the Minister of State for the Economy of Turkey (EBS/95/28, 3/g/95), the Turkish authorities are requesting the extension of the current SBA by six months, with an accompanying increase in access of SDR 101.2 million (Table 1). Purchases under the proposed extended arrangement would total SDR 610.5 million (95 percent of quota), involving access of 57 percent at an annual rate. II. Backeround Macroeconomic performance in Turkey in recent years has been characterized by strong, if uneven, growth, and persistently high inflation (Chart 1). Implementation of major structural reforms during the early 198Os, notably a shift toward a more outward-looking industrialization strategy, laid the basis for a solid growth performance, but failure to rein in high and rising public sector deficits undermined the authorities' goal of achieving a reduction in inflation. In 1993, further growth in the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR), accompanied by a loosening of monetary conditions, resulted in a surge in domestic demand and a sharp deterioration in the current account position. Increasing recognition of the unsustainability of this policy stance, coupled with a sharp downgradtng in Turkey's credit rating in international capital markets, contributed to an exchange market crisis during the first months of 1994, during which the Turkish lira depreciated by close to 60 percent. On April 5, 1994, the authorities announced an ambitious package of stabilization measures and structural reforms that provided the basis for the program supported by the SBA. JJ The strategy underlying the authorities' program placed primary emphasis on substantial front-loaded fiscal adjustment, supported by structural reforms intended to scale back the role of the public sector in the economy. Monetary policy, freed from the pressure to monetize government deficits, was set to prevent the exchange rate from depreciating below an indicative path consistent with the inflation target, thereby providing a form of nominal anchor for prices during the stabilization process. lJ See EBS/94/114 (5/27/94) and supplements for details of the program, and ERS/94/211 (10/28/94) for discussion of developments during the first six months of the stabilization program.

On the one hand, GNP declined by close to 6 percent during the year, IJ compared with program expectations of a fall of some 2 percent, while initial success in achieving a sharp reduction in inflation during the summer months proved fleeting, with prices growing rapidly again during the final months of the year. On the other, the external payments position, a key cause of investor concern at the outset of the year, improved dramat- ically, with the current account moving from a deficit of USS6.4 billion (3.6 percent of GNP) in 1993 to a surplus of some USS2.8 billion (2.1 per- cent of GNP) in 1994. All external payments obligations were met, the stock of short-term external debt was cut by one-third, and foreign reserves were quickly restored to pre-crisis levels. The sharp fall in GNP during 1994 reflected the contractionary effects of sharp fiscal adjustment, high real interest rates, and disorderly market conditions in the aftermath of the crisis; drought-impaired output levels in agriculture played a supplementary role. Domestic demand declined by some 12 percent (reversing the gain of the previous year), with a sharp reduction in inventories and a one-third cut in public fixed investment together accounting for more than half of this decline. This was partly offset, however, by a sharp increase in net exports. Preliminary indications of a rapid recovery in output and capacity utilization ratios were not sustained, and output remained subdued through the first quarter of 1995.(Chart 2). Labor market statistics suggest significant declines in both the partici- pation rate and employment, with unemployment projected to have increased by late 1994 by at least 3 percentage points from the 8.4 percent level recorded in April 1994. 2/ I/ In November 1993, the State Institute for Statistics published a comprehensive revision of the national accounts for the years 1968-1993 which resulted, inter alia, in an increase of some 30 percent in estimates of GNP for recent years. All estimates in this report, and in accompanying documents, are calculated using the revised GNP series; an Appendix in the accompanying Recent Economic Developments report discusses the nature of the revisions. 2/ Analysis of labor market trends is impaired by the lack of timely data; the Household Labor Force Survey, carried out in April and October of each year, contains much valuable information, but the most recent data available relate to April 1994. In addition, interpretation of this information is made difficult by the existence of an underground economy and by large flows of rural-urban migration, which have major effects on the participation rate.

Much of the surge in inflation can be explained by reference to large exchange rate depreciation and public sector price adjustments in the first five months of the year, when wholesale prices rose by some 82 percent. This was followed by a period, lasting through August, of greatly reduced inflation (with prices rising by less than 2 percent a month), which gave way, however, to a marked resurgence of inflation in the final months of 1994. The revival of inflation since August appears to have been associated mainly with a revival of inflationary expectations that was not adequately offset through monetary policy. Initial success in reducing inflation was in part assisted by strong program credibility--which also led to apprecia- tion of the exchange rate-- but in the main it can be attributed to the effects of the massive demand shock, and associated destocking, on price formation during the first months of the program, aided by favorable seasonal factors. Subsequently, uncertainties developed about the sustain- ability of the adjustment program, which were amplified by tensions within the coalition government and recurrent speculation on the likelihood of early parliamentary elections. With skepticism about the program intensifying in the wake of the striking down of the privatization law by the Constitutional Court in July, seasonal trends turning unfavorable, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public180 .966=100) Industrial Sector: Outout 170 160 ?dind.gra 120 4N MAR MAY JUL SEP NOV ,US$ mllllon) Exports :3-months mowng average) 1600 1 I I I I I I I I I I I I JAN MAR MAY JUL SEP NOV - 4a - CHART 2 TURKEY MONTHLY ECONOMIC INDICATORS 160 170 160 Private Manufacturing Sector: ;;I 601 I I ' I I I I I " ' JAN MAR MAY JUL SEP NOV 2000 28OC 260C 1800 240C 1600 22oc 1400 2ooc 1200 18OC 1000 16OC us million Imports (3-months moving average) II L 'J ‘.., ‘.., . ..’ ,..’ ‘.., ;’ ‘.., ;,’ IdI mpor.gra “.., ,:’ ‘.. / %.

The role played by monetary aggregates in the inflationary process during the year is the subject of some debate. During the first four months of the year, loss of confidence in the lira coupled with concerns about the integrity of the banking system was reflected in a sharp decline in money demand, and associated capital outflows (Chart 4). Subsequently, real money stocks recovered rapidly and by July had regained the position they had at the beginning of the year. Underpinning this recovery was the early success of the program in stabilizing financial and exchange markets, notably through a sharp increase in lira interest rates, and the confidence- enhancing effects of the extension of government deposit insurance to cover all household deposits in domestic banks. With this recovery being accompanied by a drop in inflation, a sharp increase in net foreign assets, an appreciation of the exchange rate and a decline relative to program limits in central bank NDA--as the CBT sought partially to sterilize the monetary effects of the increase in reserves --the more plausible explanation for the increase in money is that it reflected an increase in its demand. a/ From August onward, M2 remained almost flat in nominal terms, as downward pressure on interest rates, in conjunction with loss of confidence in the lira, was reflected in a portfolio shift back to foreign currency deposits. The substantial cushion established vis-a-vis the program floors by the preceding appreciation of the lira made possible an exchange rate depreciation at rates substantially in excess of program expectations during ensuing months without breaching the indicative floors (Charts 5 and 6). The PSBR was reduced by 4.5 percentage points of GNP from the 1993 level, notwithstanding a 1.6 percentage point increase in interest payments, while the primary surplus, at some 2 percent of GNP, was the first surplus recorded since 1988 and the strongest performance in over a decade (Table 2). The sizable reduction in the PSBR, combined with a shift by the Treasury to nonmonetary financing mechanisms, effectively eliminated the u Agricultural prices increased by some 30 percent in September and October, in contrast to a 6 percent increase during the same period in 1993, while the average price of a U.S. dollar-DM currency basket rose by some 10 percent in August-September, a period for which programmed inflation was 2.3 percent. 2/ While the staff views the strong monetary growth in the June-July period as reflecting a recovery of the demand for money, the forthcoming OECD Survey of Turkey develops the argument that this growth played a key role in stimulating inflation in later months.

Net foreign borrowing of the public sector dropped by close to 3 percent of GNP, to a net outflow of -1.3 percent in 1994. As a result, the public sector took up some two thirds of bank credit growth during the first nine months of, the year, while the stock of credit extended to the private sector declined significantly in real terms (Chart 7). A related consequence was that, given the high domestic real rates of interest, the shortfall in (lower cost) foreign financing vis-8-vis program expectations caused a sizable overrun in total interest payments for the year. Key to the improved financial performance of the public sector was the sharp reduction in primary (noninterest) expenditures by the consolidated budget, a cut of some 4 percentage points of GNP. Reduced outlays on personnel (1.8 percentage points), investment (1.0 percentage point), and transfers to state enterprises (0.8 percentage points) accounted for the bulk of the decline (Table 3 and Chart 8). Budgetary revenues increased modestly, by some 0.7 percentage points, aided by a package of once-off t,ax measures that yielded some 1.8 percent of GNP. However, despite the sharp adjustment of the budget outcome, the fiscal performance criterion for end- December, covering the budget and some extrabudgetary financing operations, was breached by some TL 50 trillion (1.3 percent of GNP), with privatization shortfalls and unexpectedly high interest payments explaining most of the deviation (Table 4). Financial performance of the state enterprises was also somewhat weaker than programmed, although significantly improved on the 1993 outcome; the borrowing requirement was reduced from 3.6 percent of GNP in 1993 to 2.7 percent in 1994, notwithstanding the substantial reduction in budgetary transfers noted above. 2/ The improved operating performance was due in large part to a decline in personnel outlays estimated at 0.9 percent of GNP, and reduced investment levels. Financial performance of the seven SEES covered under a separate performance criterion in the SBA was in line with program targets, albeit as a result of lower-than-projected inventory accumulation rather than improved operational performance; the end-year performance criterion was met by a modest margin. u ,In the first quarter of 1994, CBT credit to the Government had increased by some TL 55 trillion (10 percent of quarterly GNP). 2J Financial data for SEES and many extrabudgetary entities are available only with a substantial lag; the data quoted in the text, with the exception of those relating to the end-year performance criterion, are the authorities' projections based on the first nine months of 1994.

Imports declined by some 24 percent in dollar terms, reversing the near 30 percent growth of the previous year, while exports grew by some 17 percent, contributing to an improvement in the current ' account position of close to 6 percentage points of GNP. The strong current account performance accommodated short-term capital outflows of some USS3.3 billion on a net basis (primarily reflecting a reduction by USS7.7 billion in short-term credits), under conditions where other (long- term) flows were barely positive. u After collapsing in the early months of the year, foreign reserves ended up marginally higher than at end-1993. Progress in implementing the structural reform agenda of the April 5 program was slow (EBS/94/211). Privatization had to await passage of a law by Parliament, which did not occur until late November. The program for implementing enterprise closures encountered vigorous opposition and was undermined by the legal difficulties of the privatization process; few closures were implemented. Cuts in government agricultural support programs were implemented as intended, aided in part by favorable price developments and poor harvests, but the sensitive issue of social security reform remained to be tackled. III. Be 1995 Pronra Policies for 1995 were elaborated against the background of extensive discussions on the lessons to be drawn from the experience in 1994 and on the constraints on policies looking forward. As regards the past, the authorities took some satisfaction from the substantial fiscal adjustment achieved in 1994, a pre-condition for successful stabilization, and drew attention to the strong export growth recorded and the large debt repayments that had been made without access to new financing. However, the resurgence and continued strength of inflation, coupled with weak output performance, was a great disappointment, and had undermined much of the public support originally afforded to the April 5 program. These setbacks had also prevented a recovery of the international markets' confidence in Turkey, further limiting the country's access to external savings. This in turn had forced more of the adjustment on the domestic economy and further raised the associated costs. The proximate causes behind the disappointing price performance included an exogenous factor such as the drought, but also the consequences of the erosion of credibility of the program, and therefore of the lJ Amortization payments, amounting to USS5.4 billion, were offset by portfolio investment, project loans and savings deposits from Turkish residents abroad (the Dresdner scheme).

These had also raised questions about the longer-term sustainability of the fiscal adjustment. Furthermore, the monetary program had proven less tight than intended, with, on the one hand, the effect of tight credit ceilings being undermined by a combination of large reserve increases and dramatic shifts in the demand for money and, on the other, the downside protection intended by the specification of an exchange rate floor being undermined by a large initial appreciation of the currency. As a result, there.had been scope to lower interest rates rapidly just at the time when expectations were turning against the program--a process that resulted in exchange rate depreciation at ,a pace well in excess of program expectations and in a concomitant shock to price formation. After the experience of 1994, re-imparting credibility to the procesr: had acquired crucial importance. This was necessary both for the program to succeed, but also to lower the real opportunity costs of the adjustment to tolerable proportions. It was agreed that, to this end, progress in reducing inflation and in strengthening the medium-term sustainability of the adjustment would be mutually reinforcing elements. Thus, the tight financial policies would need to be complemented by policies that consolidated and deepened the fiscal adjustment achieved in 1994 and by a reinvigorated program of structural reforms. As foreshadowed during the discussions during the first review of the progr.am, the authorities and the staff examined the possibility of designing the anti-inflation program around a commitment to a firm exchange rate anchor; specifically, around a crawling band for the exchange rate to be defended primarily through vigorous use of interest rate policy but also through a complementary incomes policy. The advantages of an exchange rate anchor were recognized, but the authorities argued that the basic conditions for the safe introduction of such a scheme were not in place. The impaired credibility of the program and the maj'or uncertainties that prevailed in the domestic political arena as well as in international financial markets, created a strong case for avoiding irrleversible commitments and high-risk strategies. Commitments of the kind mentioned would not be viewed as credible. Indeed, they would promptly be tested to the limit and possibly overwhelmed. On incomes policy, the authorities noted that negotiation of a wage pact with public sector unions would be extremely difficult under current institutional conditions, and that substantial wage restraint in the public: sector had been achieved in 1994 without resort to centralized negotiations. The authorities were reasonably confident that wage behavior would remain moderate in 1995. Against this background, it was agreed to formulate an anti-inflation strategy that would rely primarily on monetary policy, supported by fiscal and structural reform measures. This policy is to be based on strict limits to credit expansion and complemented by an interest rate policy aimed at limiting exchange rate depreciation to a pace consistent with the inflation target.

The thrust of this policy, and the inflation and exchange rate targets involved, would be communicated to the public at the outset. This general policy approach is modelled after that of 1994; however, it would now be implemented under conditions where fiscal consolidation is more established, the structural reforms that underpin the sustainability of the fiscal adjustment are more advanced, and where provisions have been made to avoid month-to-month depreciations in the exchange rate significantly in excess of the targeted rate of inflation (see below). Inflation inertia remains a major risk. The authorities expect that it will prove possible to reduce this inertia through a combination of intensified structural reforms that would strengthen program credibility; preannounced quarterly limits on the pace of exchange rate depreciation intended to provide a transparent signal of trends in the prices of tradable goods; and gradual acquisition of credibility through sustained pursuit of the program's anti-inflation policies. Nevertheless, the timing of the expected break in the momentum of inflation is uncertain and in the meantime the degree of inflation inertia may be such that the arrangement could lead to substantial cumulative loss of competitiveness, induce a need for higher interest rates than otherwise, and generally raise the output costs of the adjustment, which could undercut the political support for the program. Concerns about negative effects on competitiveness are given.added weight by the expectation of intensified competitive pressure on domestic producers with the planned implementation of a customs union with the EU in January 1996. However, it was felt that competitiveness remains strong and that there was scope for taking measured risks in this regard for the sake of harnessing inflation. The authorities emphasized their intention to maintain vigilance over developments in this area and, if needed, to consult with the staff on the continued appropriateness of the exchange rate path proposed in the program (113 of the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies). The key numerical parameters of the program for 1995 include achieving annual inflation of some 37 percent on an end-year basis, output growth of some 3 percent, and a current account surplus of some USS1.5 billion (1.0 percent of GNP). After a projected increase of some 18 percent during the first quarter, price inflation would fall sharply during ensuing quarters, averaging some 1.6 percent per month during the last eight months of the year. Output growth would be driven by a modest recovery in domestic demand, led by some rebuilding of stocks and a recovery in private fixed investment. lJ Net exports would contract, reflecting the impact of rising domestic demand on imports. Staff noted that the projected pace of lJ Stock accumulation would amount to some 0.2 percent of GNP, compared with average accumulation of 0.7 percent of GNP during 1987-93. Given the heavy destocking in 1994, the swing in stock accumulation accounts for close to half the projected growth in domestic demand.

Monetary and exchanze rate policies As just indicated, monetary policy is to focus on maintaining a stable path for the nominal exchange rate during the inflation-reduction process, with public announcement of this policy intended to bring price expectations more closely into line wLth program inflation targets. ',ZJ In operational terms, management of the exchange rate is to be guided by the need to maintain the exchange rate above an agreed floor for each month, consistent with the annual inflation target and by the need to ensure that the pace of depreciation from month 'to month does not substantially exceed the target inflation rate for the month, thereby impeding a destabilizing depreciation in the event that the exchange rate rises substantially above the agreed floor. Interest rate po:Licy is to be subordinated to the task of managing the exchange rate, with the CBT and the Treasury coordinating intervention in money markets in a manner consistent with this task (113-14). This coordination has been substantially improved in recent months, aided in part by acceptance of the principle that interest rate policies should be determined by the needs of monetary policy, rather than by the desire to reduc:e the interest burden on the budget. The authorities view the proposed policy stance as a sound basis for proceeding under current conditions. The need to avoid a premature easing of interest rates is now generally accepted, as is the case for making the exchange rate the operational focus of day-to-&y monetary management. The choice of the exchange rate as the guide to interest rate policy is sug- gested by the instability observed in money demand relationships; this approach would have the effect of raising interest rates beyond what is impli.ed by the credit program in the event of an unexpected increase in the velocity of money, or would result in exchange rate appreciation and additional reserve accumulation if velocity moves the other way. A monetary program for 1995 consistent with the inflation and exchange rate targets has been developed, with broad money expected to remain unchanged in real terms over the year as a whole, implying a slight rise :Ln JJ The most recent pro'jections of the OECD Secretariat, prepared following the discussion on Turkey by the Economic and Development Review Committee on February 7, 1995, envisage output growth of some 2.8 percent in 1995, coupled with an increase in the GNP #deflator of some 70 percent. 2/ This would also avoid misinterpretations such as those that occurred in 1994 when market participants chose to interpret the exchange rate floors as targets. This created an unintended inflationary bias once the rate moved above the floor but agents believed .that it was required to drop back to the floor.

Reserve money and central bank NDA would increase by some 41 percent and 28 percent, respectively, with net international reserVes of the CBT projected to increase by some USSO. bil- lion over the year. 1/ CBT advances to the Treasury would increase by a maximum of TL 49 trillion over the year (the maximum allowed under existing legislation), accounting for just over half of the allowed growth in NDA. While capital inflows on the scale observed during the summer months of 1994 are deemed unlikely at this juncture, the targets for the monetary program would be re-examined at the time of the third program review if reserve accumulation is substantially larger than currently projected. With fears of a banking system crisis having faded, the authorities are moving ahead with regulatory reforms intended to reduce the risks of such a crisis in the future (120). 2/ Regulations on bank lending to related parties have been tightened further, while regulations linking banks' maximum open foreign exchange position to their capital base are being phased in over the next twelve months. Preparations are underway to introduce standardized accounting and reporting practices for banks in January 1996, and draft standards for inflation-adjusted accounting by banks and nonbanks alike are being developed by the Board of Accounting Standards. A scaling back of the 100 percent deposit insurance coverage extended last April is under preparation, but implementation of such a reform is deemed premature at this juncture. The gradual reduction in reserve and liquidity requirements implied by reforms introduced in April 1994 was interrupted by an across-the-board increase in these requirements in January 1995. The authorities noted that these increases were undertaken as a temporary liquidity absorption measure, and that they remained committed to reducing the burden on financial intermediation when macroeconomic conditions are more favorable. 3. Fiscal ~olicv Continuation of fiscal restraint is required to strengthen credibility and to ameliorate the effects of monetary tightness on private investment and the competitiveness of the exchange rate. The fiscal program for 1995 includes a further strengthening of the public finances, although by and large it represents a consolidation of the sizable adjustment already effected in the previous year. The staff concurred with the authorities' view that, following the sharp contraction of public expenditure in the last nine months of 1994 and given the difficulties of increasing taxes further under conditions of reduced economic activity, the fiscal program should aim more at improving the quality and sustainability of the adjustment than at increasing the scale of it. Reduced emphasis on expanding the primary I/ Growth in reserve money exceeds the projected growth of the monetary aggregates because changes in reserve and liquidity requirements are expected to produce a slight decline in money multipliers over the year. 2-/ An MAE technical assistance mission in August 1994 had provided a blueprint for action in this area.

Furthermore, from a medium-term perspective, the primary balances (excluding privatization receipts) in 1994 and projected for 1995 already exceed those required to stabilize the debt/GNP ratio at a moderate level (see below). The task is largely to maintain the present position and to ensure the timely implementation of the structural reforms that would prevent the erosion of these surpluses in the future. The fiscal stance for 1995 is best illustrated by the evolution of tlhe primary surplus, excluding privatization receipts, of the total public sector that, after strengthening by 6 percentage points of GNP in 1994, is projected to increase only marginally in 1995. The resulting fiscal position would nonetheless imply an overall primary surplus and, once account is taken of privatization revenues, a major improvement in public sector finances. In particular, the central government would exhibit a primary surplus of 6 percent of GNP with the budget deficit being limited to 3.2 percent. 1993 1994 1995 (Program) (U percent of GNP) Central government, overall -6.9 -3.8 -3.2 Primary balance -0.9 3.8 6.0 Primary balance (ex-privatization) -1.5 3.7 4.3 PSBR 12.5 8.0 5.6 Primary balance -4.0 2.1 5.7 Primary balance (ex-privatization) -4.3 1.7 2.3 Budgetary revenues are to be boosted b:y both new taxes and proceeds from privatization. u The slow pace of the economic recovery complicated the task of strengthening revenue performance and of making up for the lapse of the once-off taxes introduced in 1994. The authorities were determined - I/ The privatization law stipulates that privatization proceeds cannot be used to finance the budget, but instead should be devoted to pay for the privatization process, to finance new investment or to retire public debt. However, the budget is allowed to receive proceeds from land sales and from the disposition of assets of the telecommunications company (TTAS), which was exempted from the general privatization law.

Similarly, it was deemed that given problems of reduced compliance, it would be imprudent to increase once more the VAT (which had last been raised in late 1993). Thus, the authorities put together a package of tax measures (16) that is projected to yield an increase in permanent taxes of about 1 percent of GNP. This increase would also be equal to the total increase in budget revenues, as the lapse of the once-off taxes is to be matched by the privatization revenues that accrue to the budget. 1993 1994 1995 (Program) (u nercent of GNP) Revenues 18.2 18.9 20.0 Regular revenues 17.9 17.0 18.1 Once-off measures -- 1.8 0.2 Privatization 0.3 0.1 1.7 Budget expenditures, in turn, are projected to fall further by about 1 percent of GNP, as a result mainly of cuts in transfers--to enterprises and incentive or subsidy programs --and in personnel expenditures. The authorities explained that wages were projected to increase at a rate similar to that of the program's end-of-period target for inflation, thus falling behind the average rate of inflation for the year. In addition, the drop in the wage bill would reflect some shedding of personnel (mainly through attrition). Nonetheless, the authorities are aware that wage discipline will be difficult to maintain, coming after the sharp cuts in real terms of 1994. This highlights the importance of an early drop in inflation. Investment expenditures would remain broadly unchanged from the restrained levels of 1994, u but including investment that is to be financed off-budget with part of the proceeds from privatization, total government investment in 1995 would slightly exceed that of 1994. Interest payments in 1995 were projected assuming a nominal interest rate that starts at close to 170 percent in January and declines to 45 per- cent in December; compared with the inflation path assumed in the program, this would result in an average real interest rate on domestic debt in 1995 of about 37 percent per annum. This very high cost of domestic borrowing illustrates the continued vulnerability of the fiscal program to changes in 1/ Once account is taken of wage expenditures that through 1994 had been classified as investment outlays.

Thus the present situation should not give rise to a sustainability problem in the medium- term provided that inflation is brought down and the real rates that prevail at present decline to more normal levels. Table 7 presents an analysis of fiscal sustainability in the period to 2000. Under the assumption that: (I) the real interest on newly issued debt declines to 7 percent per annum by 2000, (ii) real GNP grows by about 4h percent a year, and (iii) access to central bank advances is virtually closed by 1998 as scheduled, 2/ the debt-GNP ratio would show a continuous decline, notwithstanding a rapid contraction of the primary surplus to about 2 percent of GNP. 2/ The intended adjustment in the financial position of the central government will be complemented by an additional improvement in the rest of the public sector. This would in the main reflect the receipt of privatiza- tion revenues, and to a lesser extent some further strengthening of the state enterprises. Total proceeds from privatization could reach 3.4 per- cent of GNP, or close to US$5 billion, almost equally divided between those that accrue to the Privatization Administration and those accruing to the budget. Allowing for delays in the process, most of these revenues have been projected to be received in the latter part of the year, but even so the authorities acknowledged that the total amount projected may be on the optimistic side. As a precaution, the fiscal performance criterion in the program specifies an adjustor that requires that, as a minimum, one fifth of the expected proceeds materialize, and that the authorities take additional measures to offset any shortfall from this assumption. 4. Structural reforms Substantial structural reforms are needed to ensure sustainability of the planned fiscal adjustment over the medium term. At the same time, and as demonstrated by the experience in 1994, tangible evidence of progress on reforms is a major factor in fostering credibility in the program and in helping reduce inflationary inertia. The authorities have given priority to reforms concerning state enterprises (SEES), the social security system, and the agricultural sector. The second (current) review of the SBA was to focus on the progress made in implementing structural reforms, particularly those relating to SEES. u The program for 1995 assumes gross external financing equivalent to 1.5 percent of GNP, and gross payments abroad of 3 percent of GNP. u Central bank advances to the Treasury are being reduced in line with a predetermined schedule. 2/ In the forthcoming OECD Survey of Turkey, the primary surplus consistent with a constant debt-GNP ratio and annual inflation of 10 percent is estimated at 1.0-1.5 percent of GNP.

A key element of the privatization strategy, for which a detadled timetable of targets and actions has been specified, is to seek strategic investors for enterprises to be privatized by means of block sales of shares, with the remaining shares being sold via public offering at a later stage. Two of these block sales were completed by the end of March. The staff welcomed the ambitious intentions of the authorities, and emphasized the need for speed and transparency in the process. The staff also noted that plans to sell off the more profitable SEES initially, while sensible as a means of building momentum for the privatization process, risked leaving the problems of the financially weak SEES unaddressed. This highlighted the need for firm action to reduce losses in those SEES expected to remain in state ownership in the short term. The April 5 program had included commitments to close a specified list of SEES deemed to be nonviable, should it prove impossible to privatize them. Progress in this area was impaired by the lack of a legal framework for privatization, while vigorous public opposition in those cities and regions likely to be most affected by closures highlighted the political costs of moving forward on this issue. The authorities indicated that outright closure of plants was no longer an acceptable option, except as a last resort; and that privatization, even if it involved an initial outlay by the Government, was a preferable choice. &/ The staff accepted the view that the sale of an enterprise as a going concern was preferable to outright closure, and recognized that transfers of lossmakers to private ownership could involve state aid to the purchasers. However, the staff cautioned that aid packages in such a context should be terminal in nature and not involve further accumulation of government liabilities; privatiza- tion without imposition of a hard budget constraint was unlikely to yield efficiency gains or improved financial performance. As regards the enterprises that would remain in the public sector, the staff argued for vigorous actions to improve the financial performance in the five largest lossmakers, which collectively accounted for some two thirds of SEE losses in 1994. The authorities outlined their intentions in 1/ Transfer of the Karabuk steel works, a large lossmaker, to a consortium that includes local industrialists and trade unions representing the workforce is currently underway.

J/ Reform of the social security system is a key priority for medium-term fiscal sustainability. Notwithstanding the at present favorable demographic situation, the social security institutions are substantially underfunded. and, in the absence of major reforms, are expected to become increasingly reliant on budgetary subsidies as time proceeds. 2/ The authorities have been engaged in a dialogue with IBRD staff on reform of the public health, pensions, and social assistance systems, with a view to implementing an integrated reform package in early 1996 (118). J/ As an interim measure to stabilize the financial position of the state pension funds, the authorities have announced plans to impose a minimum retirement age (55 for women, 60 for men) for those seeking to draw pensions, and to raise the minimum contribution period for eligibility (to 20 and 25 years, respec- tively, for women and men). The authorities reported that agricultural support policies had been trimmed back in line with the policy commitments of the April 5 program,, and that nonmarket-based financing of the agricultural cooperatives by the state-owned banks had been eliminated. The burden on the agricultural sector of these policy changes had been attenuated by real exchange rate depreciation and favorable external prices. The authorities indicated their intent to maintain this policy stance during 1995, with support price levels for the three product groups that remain covered by the formal support system being aligned with world prices (121). In a related development, the authorities reported that incentive schemes for investment and exports have also been trimmed back and made to conform to practices in the KU. 5. Balance of navments nroiections The program for 1995 envisages a surplus in the external current account of USS1.5 billion, down from USS2.8 billion in 1994. The authorities were hesitant to project a larger surplus indicating that the expected recovery of domestic demand, including inventory rebuilding, would inevitably draw in imports and limit export growth. The staff regarded the authorities' projection as conservative, given that a significant revival in 1/ Developing a reform program for TCDD, the state railway company and the largest projected lossmaker in 1995, requires deciding on the role of railways in national transport policy.

Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - domestic demand was not apparent while prospects for solid growth of exports, including tourism, were favorable as the economic recovery in major trading partners gathered steam. Moreover, Turkey's competitiveness margin, as indicated by the real effective exchange rate at end-1994, was still comfortable, with some favorable effects of the earlier real depreciation on the trade balance yet to work themselves through. Accordingly, the outturn for the external current account may well be better than programmed. Restoration of more stable domestic conditions would go a long way to enhance Turkey's international creditworthiness. At the same time, renewed access to foreign financing, in addition to facilitating management of the public debt, would boost confidence in domestic markets and strengthen the program's credibility. A modest net capital inflow of some US$250 million is projected for 1995. The authorities were optimistic about prospective inflows associated with their privatization program and renewed access to international borrowing. Consistent with this, they expected net direct investment and portfolio inflows of some USS2.4 billion L/ along with a net outflow of USS1.9 billion on account of other medium- and long-term capital (largely reflecting debt repayments of some USS6.2 billion). 2/ While acknowledging that shortfalls in some elements of the medium- and long-term capital inflows (such as BOT financing) would be offset by lower realization of imports, the staff cautioned that the projected level of medium- and long-term external financing, particularly new borrowing from international financial markets, could be on the optimistic.side. On the other hand, the authorities' expectations for short-term capital flows, with a modest net outflow of US$300 million, appeared to be unduly cautious, particularly in view of the high real rates of interest expected to prevail in Turkey. The cushion provided by the high current level of international reserves would, in any event, aid in absorbing possible shortfalls. It was agreed that the overall balance of payments appeared manageable, albeit with a level of capital inflows overly depressed for a country in Turkey's stage of economic development. Based on these projections, the program seeks a further net inter- national reserve buildup of US$600 million in 1995 resulting in a reserve cover equivalent to three months of imports.

The latter include USS2.4 billion in public and private sector project related credits, US$500 million in syndicated loans, US$lSO million in European Resettlement Fund loans, and US$450 million in financing associated with Build Operate and Transfer projects (BOT).

On March 6, 1995 the Association Council of the EU approved the draft declaration for a customs union with Turkey in 1996. Considerable progress has already been made in reducing customs tariffs and levies with a view to harmonizing Turkey's trade regime with that of the EU. Further reductions are envisaged during the course of the year with a view, in particular, to eliminating tariffs on industrial goods and to phase out the Mass Housing Fund levy, which would also bring Turkey's trade regime in line with its obligations under the GATT. Work is also well advanced regarding the harmonization of legislation pertaining to competition and commercial policies and intellectual property rights, as well as other regulations. Achievement of the customs union could, in due course, also result in EU- based financing flows to Turkey and enhance its prospects for attracting foreign direct investments in export-oriented industries. 6. Features of the stand-bv arrangement The set of performance criteria of the program has been maintained and limits were established for all quarters of 1995 (Table 8). JJ Coverage of the performance criteria was also maintained, with the exception of that relating to budgetary performance, which was expanded fully to include the operations of the Public Participation Fund. a/ In addition, the indica- tive limits for the nominal exchange rate of the Turkish lira have been specified in terms of a basket comprising the U.S. dollar and the deutsche mark. A further review of the program, to be completed by August 31, 1995, was specified (126) with the objective of examining, inter alla, develop- ments in monetary policy and in the structural reform area. The phasing of purchases was modified to accommodate the requested increase in the amount of the arrangement. IV. Medium-Term Outlook and Caoacitv to Repay An illustrative medium-term macroeconomic framework is presented in Table 9. Macroeconomic stability would allow for a recovery of investment and the restoration of real GNP growth to potential by 1996. The central government deficit achieves a position of approximate balance over the medium term as fiscal restraint is maintained and interest rates decline. This is supported by further structural reforms, particularly privatization I/ The March limits on NIR and NDA of the Central Bank were specified as indicative, given that actual performance in this regard would already be known by the time of the Executive Board meeting. a/ In 1994 only part of the financing of the PPF (the issuance of participation certificates) had been included. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - and enterprise restructuring, which contribute to better financial perform- ance of the rest of the public sector. The overall public sector saving- investment balance improves by slightly over 3 percent of GNP by 1998. Public sector consolidation of this magnitude facilitates a sustained rise in private investment and strong private savings. Such an evolution of domestic balances allows for a sustainable external current account position, with only modest deficits toward the end of the decade. The associated detailed balance of payments projections are shown in Table 5. Consistent with a vigorous privatization program and the achievement of the customs union with the EU, direct investment inflows are projected to strengthen over the medium term. This, combined with conservative assumptions regarding net portfolio and short-term capital inflows, and medium- and long-term loan disbursements in line with historical trends and outstanding commitments, suggests good prospects for timely debt servicing and improvement in Turkey's debt ratios. External debt declines to 30 percent of GNP by the end of the decade (from 49 percent at year-end 1994) and the debt service ratio is lowered to 19 percent of current account receipts (from 30 percent in 1994). The main risk to the medium-term outlook stems from factors, including political, that would cause shortfalls in the implementation of the stabili- zation program or subsequent policy slippages. The sustainability of the balance of payments rests on continued improvements in the public sector savings-investment balance and the associated demand restraint, as well as the maintenance of Turkey's competitive position. The early decline of inflation is again crucial for these assumptions. On the other hand, given its diversified sources of current account inflows (exports, tourism, and workers' remittances) and moderate external debt levels, Turkey's external position is less vulnerable to shocks affecting any single one of these items. Turkey's obligations to the Fund at year-end 1994 stood at SDR 236 mil- lion, equivalent to 37 percent of quota. Assuming full drawing of scheduled purchases, Fund exposure would peak in early 1996 at 95 percent of quota. The resulting repurchase obligations would peak in 1999 at 0.9 percent of exports of goods and services. Taking into account this modest repayment burden, the good repayment record under previous arrangements, and the medium-term balance of payments outlook, the staff's assessment of Turkey's capacity to repay the Fund is favorable (Table 10).

Staff Annraisab Turkey has made strong progress in attaining the ambitious goals of the stabilization program it adopted after the external crisis that broke in early 1994. The tight financial policies that were adopted, particularly the sharp correction made in the fiscal accounts, helped effect a major strengthening of the external position. This permitted Turkey fully to honor its large debt service commitments and to rebuild its depleted international reserves, notwithstanding difficult capital market conditions. The depth of the adjustment brought about a sharp recession, from which the economy is only now gradually emerging. However, the performance with regard to inflation was also disappointing, with inflation moving back up sharply after an initial decline. This reversal appeared to be rooted in a loss of confidence sparked initially by political uncertainties and the authorities' inability to deliver on their structural agenda, but sustained and exacerbated thereafter by a premature relaxation of monetary policy. The staff considers that the policies proposed by the authorities for 1995 are consistent with the thrust of the program supported by the stand-by arrangement. The program, nevertheless, still carries substantial risks. First, the setback on inflation and the associated inflationary inertia risks stretching the limits of the proposed monetary and exchange rate policies. Second, pressures to ease the program are likely to emerge, particularly pressures to relax the continuing fiscal restraint; resisting these may test the still fragile political situation. Third, credibility in the program has been greatly undermined in 1994 by the difficulties encountered in bringing the privatization process into full gear, and it remains to be seen whether the ambitious targets set in this regard for 1995 will be achieved. Nevertheless, these risks become acceptable when seen against the progress that has been made and the commitment of the authorities to carry through with their policies. The program for 1995 reaffirms and strengthens the strategy followed by its predecessor, seeking to consolidate and deepen the progress made in the fiscal area and to move forward the agenda for structural reform. With these aspects underpinning the credibility of policies, the brunt of the attack against inflation will be borne by a monetary policy built around a tight constraint on the nominal exchange rate. Interest rate policy will be fully subordinated to this objective. The use of the exchange rate as a guide for monetary policy is warranted because of the uncertainties surrounding money demand and is made possible by the adequate margin of competitiveness that the present level of the rate still provides. The targets established by the authorities are once again ambitious, but this time, and with skepticism about the ability of policies to reduce inflation more deeply entrenched, the risks are considerably higher. Real interest rates will need to be maintained at a relatively high level and the real exchange rate will likely appreciate, with consequent risks both for the comfortable level of competitiveness enjoyed at present and the political viability of the program. Nevertheless, steadfastness in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - implementation will be required. Given the central role of the exchange rate in lowering inflation, it is important that, only in the event that major deviations from the envisaged course of events occur, should consideration be given to changing the exchange rate path proposed in the program. During 1994, the authorities accomplished a major correction of the fiscal situation. Financing of public sector expenditure ceased to be a source of inflationary monetary expansion and the primary surplus was raised to a level that would ensure the medium-term sustainability of the fiscal position once the expected decline in inflation and real interest rates materialize. The staff welcomes the further strengthening of the public finances sought for 1995, especially as it comes without increasing reliance on extraordinary revenues or cuts in investment, thus signaling an improve- ment in the quality of the fiscal adjustment. Nevertheless, after the sharp cuts of the preceding year, the task of reducing expenditures further in 1995 will put heavy demands on the authorities' determination, demands that would only increase if inflation fails to decline as rapidly as envisaged. The delay in implementing the structural reforms planned for 1994 fostered skepticism about the sustainability of the adjustment and contributed to the revival of inflationary expectations. At the present juncture, clear evidence of progress in the structural area is essential to restore credibility to the program. The authorities should.make utmost efforts to avoid slippages in the implementation of their structural reform agenda. They will need to be bold and determined in moving forward with these reforms; in particular it is important that the privatization program be allowed to proceed unimpeded by pressures from interest groups and that measures to improve the performance of the enterprises that remain under public control be undertaken with vigor. The reform of the pension funds is a welcome beginning of the fundamental long-term reform required in the social security system. The resurgence of inflation has represented a serious setback to the authorities' stabilization program and a more extended timetable is now required to achieve the program's objectives. The staff supports the authorities' request for the extension of the period of the arrangement by six months as well as the associated increase in access to Fund resources. In addition, the staff proposes that the second review of the stand-by arrangement for Turkey be completed despite the nonobservance of the fiscal performance criterion corresponding to end-December 1994 and that the authorities' request for a waiver of the applicability of end-March performance criteria to the purchase originally scheduled to be made available on February 15, 1995 be granted. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Turkey be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - VI.

National accounts data have recently been comprehensively revised, and quarterly estimates are published with a two-to-three month lag. Data on foreign reserve levels and the balance sheet of the central bank are published weekly, with a one-week lag; data on international trade and the balance of payments are published monthly, with six-to-ten week lags; and price and interest rate data are published monthly, also with short lags. Areas where data quality and timeliness is an Impediment to policy analysis are touched upon in the body of this report. Perhaps the area of greatest concern relates to the financial performance of extrabudgetary government entities, including the state enterprises, where the authorities face substantial difficulties in monitoring performance on a monthly and quarterly basis. Efforts are underway at the Undersecretariat of the Treasury to develop a monitoring capability that would provide the basis for a stronger management role for the Treasury in ensuring that financial targets of extrabudgetary entities are being met. Monetary data are of good quality, with preliminary data on the monetary aggregates being published weekly, with a three-week lag. Data on the composition of banking sector assets, notably the breakdown of credits between government and non-government borrowers, take substantially longer to prepare; at present this information becomes available only with a lag of 4-5 months, As noted in the text, analysis of short-term labor market trends is impeded by the lack of timely data, a deficiency due in part to the absence of an unemployment benefit system; however, biannual household labor force surveys provide policymakers with the range of data needed for medium-term planning purposes.

Credit from the World Bank Group (IBRD, IDA, IFC and MIGA) has traditionally comprised the largest single source of medium- and long-term financing for Turkey. As of December 31, 1994, the stock of IBRD lending disbursed and outstanding was USS5.2 billion, with approximately USS2.3 billion undisbursed. The IFC also ,maintains a strong investment presence in Turkey. At end-December 1994, IFC commitments to Turkey totaled USS1.4 billion. MIGA's exposure in Turkey (including commitments) of USS71.5 million is its sixth highest. 2. Bank assistance during the 1980s consisted mainly of policy-based program lending in support of a broad-based liberalization of the Turkish economy. Since the late 198Os, lending operations have focused on investment activities, emphasizing human capital development, urban infrastructure (primarily water supply and sanitation), and environmental protection. 3. More recently, the Government has asked for Bank assistance to strengthen the institutional framework for public sector consolidation and reform. In May 1994, a Privatization Implementation Assistance and Social Safety Net Project was approved by the World Bank Board, which will help the Government to implement the first phase of its privatization program and related social safety net measures. The Bank has also been asked to provide technical and financial assistance for a program of institutional reform 'measures and investments aimed at strengthening public financial management. A Public Financial Management Project, covering tax administration, expenditure and personnel management, and customs administration, is expected to be presented to the World Bank Board in a few months. The Bank is also assisting the Government to re,view options for reform in the agriculture sector and the social security system. 4 . The Bank's future program would continue to reflect a graduated response, with the level and composition of lending depending on Turkey's macroeconomic performance. Areas of focus would include: implementing public: sector reforms; improving sectoral policies; strengthening portfolio management; and upgrading administrative capacity. 5 . IFC's strategy is to direct new investments toward: (a) a wide variety of capital market projects, designed largely to assist small- and medium- sized enterprises; (b) internationally competitive manufacturing projects; and (c) specialist department projects, including agribusiness projects and potent:ial power and telecommunication projects. In support of the Government's policies, IFC is giving high priority to investment and advisory projects involving privatization of state enterprises. It is expected that MIGA's guarantee program in Turkey will be expanded in the coming, years as Turkey enters into the customs union with the European Union ti.nd increases its reliance on external equity finance.
