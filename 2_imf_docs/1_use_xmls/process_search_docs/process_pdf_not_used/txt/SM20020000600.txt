A democratization process is under way, with a constitutional referendum scheduled in January 2002, with presidential and legislative elections to follow. l Economic activity recovered strongly in 2000-O 1, while prices remained broadly stable. Real non-oil GDP growth was 16 percent in 2000 (albeit from a low base), and is estimated at 9 percent in 2001. Overall GDP growth was significantly lower, reflecting declining oil output. l The budget deficit turned into a surplus in 2000-O 1. Government revenue exceeded program projections in 2000 and during the first nine months of 200 1, as shortfalls in non-oil revenue collection (notably at customs) were more than offset by larger-than- projected receipts from the oil sector. Expenditure outstripped budget allocations, reflecting higher-than-planned outlays for security purposes, the recruitment of civil servants, the high cost of organizing the national dialogue, and overruns in public investment projects. As a result, the primary surplus was short of target, which translated into a buildup of arrears. a The Congo’s net foreign assets position fell sharply in 2001. This reflected an increase in net government credit and the drawdown of deposits by the national oil company (SNPC) that had built up in late 2000. Based on staff estimates, the external current account improved substantially in 2000 but deteriorated somewhat in 200 1. These estimates are highly uncertain, however, because of incomplete data on oil sector transactions. l Progress in the implementation of structural reforms has been limited. A framework agreement between the government and the SNPC was signed in June 200 1, which opened the way for a financial audit of the company. In other areas, one commercial bank was privatized in February 2001, but the sale of two other commercial banks was delayed. The public enterprise privatization program is also behind schedule. l As regards debt management, the authorities concluded several restructuring arrangements in 2000 and 2001, including on the oil-collaterized debt, and issued bonds in late 2001 to securitize domestic arrears. Issues stressed in the staff appraisal l Peace has been restored, a process of democratization is under way, and economic activity has recovered. However, performance under the authorities’ economic and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- financial program has been disappointing. A number of objectives set under the post- conflict program of November 2000 could not be met, and the policy framework was revised in June 2001 in the context of a staff-monitored program. Preliminary estimates suggest that fiscal performance remained below target at end-September 2001. l The Congo’s overall financial situation weakened in 2001. Net foreign assets fell sharply during the first half of the year, and little headway was made in restoring normal relations with external partners. Available data provide an incomplete view of developments in the oil sector. At the time of the mission, the SNPC was finalizing its 2000 accounts-which delayed the launching of its financial audit-and could not clarify the rationale for drawing down its bank deposits during the first half of 200 1. The authorities need to improve the monitoring and control of oil sector transactions, and ensure full transparency in the operations of the SNPC. l The magnitude of transactions handled by the SNPC suggests that financial surpluses from oil exports are in part managed off budget. Recent oil-collaterized debt- restructuring operations not only resulted in higher debt levels, but also transferred contingent SNPC liabilities to the budget. The staff considers that the government should exercise greater oversight of the SNPC, narrow the scope of its activities to the upstream oil sector, and ensure that profits from participation are transferred to the budget on a regular basis. 0 The draft 2002 budget is broadly consistent with the priorities set under the 2000 post-conflict program. However, budget projections are based on a relatively high oil price assumption, which may well turn out optimistic. Were the need to arise, the authorities should implement rapid cuts in expenditure or defer lesser priority spending. In addition, sustained efforts will be needed to improve fiscal management, especially to tighten expenditure control and raise non-oil revenue collection. 0 The Congo remains excessively dependent on oil revenue and thus highly vulnerable to changes in international market conditions. The authorities need to accelerate implementation of structural reforms if the country is to diversify. a Fund support in the context of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility would be subject to satisfactory progress in program implementation at end-200 1, including, in particular, measures to strengthen transparency and accountability in the oil sector. a The Congo’s statistical base is weak and does not allow a comprehensive exercise of Fund surveillance. The staff urges the authorities to address this deficiency as a matter of urgency, and hopes that technical assistance from the Fund and bilateral donors will be used to the fullest extent possible.

The 200 1 Article IV consultation discussions with the Republic of Congo took place in Brazzaville from October 26 to November 9,200 1. The Republic of Congo is on the standard 12-month cycle for Article IV consultations and, together with other members of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. 2. The most recent Article IV consultation with the Republic of Congo (hereafter “the Congo”) was concluded on November 17,2000, at the same time that the Executive Board approved the Congo’s request for a drawing under the Fund’s emergency post-conflict assistance policy.’ Executive Directors commended the authorities for the rapid progress in restoring peaceful conditions and the strong economic recovery already evident in 2000. They urged the authorities to take advantage of high oil revenues to reestablish normal relations with external creditors, and thus open the way for a resumption of much-needed financial and technical assistance. Directors also stressed the importance of ensuring good governance and transparency, raising non-oil revenue collection, strengthening expenditure control, and implementing comprehensive structural reforms. 3. The authorities saw their post-conflict program for 2001 as a precursor to a more ambitious medium-term program that would promote private sector-led growth, intensify the fight against poverty, and allow access to debt relief. In the event, slippages in program implementation during the first half of 2001 prevented the initiation of discussions on a possible arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The staff agreed with the authorities on revised targets for September and December 200 1, which were recorded in a letter of intent addressed to the Managing Director in July 2001 (EBS/O1/126, 7/3 l/01). Relations with the Fund and the safeguards assessment of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) are summarized in Appendices I and II, respectively. 4. Following several years of nonaccrual status, the Congo normalized its relations with the World Bank in August 2001.2 The World Bank has resumed its involvement in the Congo in the areas of demobilization and reinsertion, capacity building, poverty reduction, and transparency, based on a Transitional Support Strategy approved in January 200 1. Relations with the World Bank Group are described in Appendix III. ’ See EBS/00/220 (1 l/7/00). Fund assistance was provided in an amount of SDR 10.575 million (12.5 percent of quota). The most recent CEMAC regional consultation took place on May 4,200l (SM/Ol/lll, 4/17/01). ’ As civil war prevented the orderly servicing of financial obligations, the World Bank moved the Republic of Congo to nonaccrual status in November 1997. Arrears to the World Bank Group totaled US$63 million at end-April 200 1; however, the arrears were subsequently reduced through cash payments and cleared in August with the help of bridge financing, following the approval by the Bank’s Executive Board of a Post-Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- 5. Little progress has been made in normalizing relations with other multilateral and bilateral creditors. In particular, the Congo’s arrears to the African Development Bank (AfDB) rose from US$8 1 million at end-2000 to US$lOO million at end-September 2001. In the circumstances, in October 2001 the AfDB withdrew from its board agenda a proposal to use grants to cofinance an institutional capacity-building project with the World Bank. 6. Some of the key data required for Fund surveillance are not available, and statistics are generally of poor quality. The Congo’s statistical apparatus clearly needs to be rebuilt, following major disruptions caused by repeated episodes of civil war. In addition, balance of payments estimates are subject to a large degree of error because of unreliable data on the oil sector, while the national oil company (SNPC) has not prepared detailed accounts to date. The authorities are addressing these deficiencies with the help of technical assistance from the Fund and other partners. Statistical issues and core statistical indicators are presented in Appendix IV. A tentative work schedule is provided in Appendix V, and income and social indicators are shown in Appendix VI. The authorities indicated their willingness to have the staff report published on the Fund’s Internet site. A draft public information notice is included in Appendix VII. II. BACKGROUND A. Recent Developments 7. After repeated civil strife during the 199Os, peaceful conditions have been restored in the Congo. Following the cease-fire agreement of December 1999, the authorities launched a vast program of reconstruction and rehabilitation of basic infrastructure. In April 2001, a national dialogue was convened in Brazzaville and all major provincial cities that focused on the main features of a proposed new constitution and plans for completing the political transition. The draft constitution was approved by the National Transition Council in September 2001, and is to be submitted to a national referendum in January 2002, with presidential and legislative elections to follow in March and May. 8. During 2000-01, the authorities focused primarily on reconstruction and demobilization. Efforts were geared toward repairing the transportation infrastructure (port of Pointe-Noire and railway, in particular); rebuilding government offices; rehabilitating sanitary systems, health facilities, and residential buildings; and stepping up road maintenance. Out of an estimated 25,000 militiamen at end-1999, about 7,000 were formally demobilized in the context of microprojects or through civil service recruitment. The government, with the help of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), also launched programs designed to collect and destroy arms. 9. Economic activity recovered strongly in 2000-01, while prices remained broadly stable. Real non-oil GDP growth was an estimated 16 percent in 2000 (albeit starting from a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- low base), and was preliminary estimated to have been 9 percent in 2001. Overall GDP growth was significantly lower, reflecting declining oil output.3 The pickup in activity reflected mainly a surge in construction, but also a strong expansion in forestry, transportation, and trade. Thanks to the rehabilitation of the port of Pointe-Noire and the railway link with Brazzaville, the supply of goods improved markedly and consumer prices declined slightly, on average, in 2001 (Table 1 and Figure 1). 10. Given the persistent weakness of the euro-to which the CFA franc is pegged at a fixed rate-vis-a-vis other major currencies, and with prices in the Congo relatively stable in recent years, the real effective exchange rate index has remained broadly constant since the mid-1990s. This indicator would suggest that the apparent gains in competitiveness achieved with the 1994 CFA franc devaluation have been preserved (Figure 2). Nevertheless, the economy continues to be little diversified and highly dependent on imported products. 11. The budget deficit turned into a surplus in 2000-01. Although government expenditure rose markedly in 2000 and 200 1, the overall budget balance turned from a deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 1999 into surpluses of 1 percent of GDP in 2000 and more than 2 percent of GDP in 200 1 (Tables 2-3).4 Government revenue exceeded program projections in 2000 and during the first nine months of 2001, as shortfalls in non-oil revenue collection (notably at customs) were more than offset by larger-than-projected receipts from the oil sector. Expenditure outstripped budget allocations, reflecting higher-than-planned outlays for security purposes (including joint operations with the Democratic Republic of the Congo armed forces), the recruitment of civil servants (notably former militiamen), the high cost of organizing the national dialogue, and overruns in public investment outlays. As a result, the primary surplus was short of target by 2.1 percent of GDP in 2000 and by 0.8 percent in 2001. 12. The smaller-than-projected budget surplus translated into a buildup of arrears. Despite recourse to domestic bank financing and the postponement of a domestic arrears clearance operation, the treasury cash position remained tight through September 200 1 and arrears accumulated, including on civil service wages (wage payments were late by about one month as of October 2001). The resources available for external debt service were also less than projected. With the bulk of external debt-service payments earmarked for the oil- collaterized debt (83 percent in 2000 and a projected 57 percent in 2001), the authorities could not sustain their commitment to meet nonreschedulable debt-service obligations from mid-2000 onward, and external arrears built up further, including on multilateral and post- 3 The drop in oil output mainly stems from the aging of several oil fields, and is expected to continue until new operations come on stream in 2004 (details on the oil sector are provided in the accompanying background papers). 4 Developments through early 2001 were reviewed in the authorities’ letter of July 27 to the Managing Director (EBS/O1/126,7/3 l/01). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- cutoff-date bilateral debt.5 The external debt stock was projected at 186 percent of GDP at end-2001, with about half of the total in arrears (including nearly US$300 million in nonreschedulable arrears). 13. Excluding public enterprise deposits, money demand recovered strongly in 2000 and early 2001, with currency outside banks growing by some 20 percent annually. However, demand deposits fell sharply in 2001, as the SNPC drew down on assets it had built up in the last few months of 2000.6 Together with the increase in net government credit, this translated into a drop in the Congo’s net foreign assets position of some US$200 million during January-September 200 1, equivalent to 43 percent of broad money at end-2000 (Table 4 and Figure 3). Part of the increase in net government credit reflected the impact of bank restructuring operations (recorded in nonbank financing in Table 2). Similarly, the drop in credit to the economy reflected the write-off of irrecoverable loans. 14. The staff estimates that the external trade and current account of the balance of payments improved substantially in 2000 but deteriorated somewhat in 2001 (Table 5). These estimates are highly uncertain, however, not only because of incomplete data on oil sector transactions but also because of doubts over the nature of data reported by oil companies.7 The overall balance of payments registered a large surplus in 2000 (equivalent to 5 percent of GDP) but turned into a deficit of an equivalent magnitude in 200 1, thus reversing the buildup of international reserves recorded in the previous year. 15. Progress in the implementation of structural reforms has been limited. The signing of a framework agreement between the government and the SNPC in June 2001 opened the way for a financial audit of the company, which the authorities had planned to complete by year’s end. In other areas, one commercial bank (the UCB) was privatized in February 200 1, but the sale of two other commercial banks (the CAIC and the BIDC) has been delayed.’ The public enterprise privatization program is also behind schedule. This situation reflects in part a lack of response on the part of potential investors (thus, no bids were received to take over management of the water company). In the case of retail 5 The Congo was also late in settling a Fund repurchase for SDR 0.9 million in October 2001. As is the case for other countries in the CFA franc zone, Congo’s external arrears result from government debt and thus do not evidence exchange restrictions. 6 The SNPC’s deposits with local banks fell from the equivalent of US$l33 million at end-2000 to about US$6 million in mid-200 1. ’ The lack of data from the SNPC prevents a proper breakdown of resident and nonresident transactions from being made. Moreover, the data provided by private oil companies are based on fiscal reporting, which introduces mismatches between actual transactions and their financing (thus, imports of goods and services are recorded when the fiscal construct of “cost oil” allows it). 8 There have been protracted negotiations for the sale of the CAIC throughout 2001; a memorandum of understanding for the sale of the BIDC was signed in December. (The fourth commercial bank, the BGFI, is deemed in good health.) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- petroleum distribution, effective privatization was subject to finalization of a revised law (issued in October) and adjustment of retail prices (still pending). In the area of civil service reform, efforts at controlling staffing levels and the wage bill were thwarted by the recruitment of former militia members into the army and various branches of public administration. 16. As regards debt management, the authorities concluded several restructuring arrangements in 2000 and 2001, and issued bonds in late 2001 to securitize domestic arrears. These operations are summarized in Box 1 (data on external debt and debt service are provided in Table 6). Box 1. Debt-Restructuring Arrangements Concluded in 2000-O 1 l Oil-collaterized debt (June 2000). US$lSO million was prepaid, plus US$2.4 million in accrued interest, on debt obligations to IHAG (Zurich) and SEB (Luxemburg), collaterized on AGIP- Congo royalty payments. A new syndicated loan was arranged by SociCt6 G&n&ale (Paris) for US$200 million, secured on guaranteed oil deliveries by the SNPC to Glencore AG (Baar- Zurich). A new loan was contracted at 4.25 points over LIBOR, with quarterly repayments through December 200 1. l Bilateral external debt (May 2001). US$SO million in arrears owed to China was cancelled. l Oil-collaterized debt (September 2001). US$197 million in debt obligations was prepaid to IHAG (Zurich) and CrCdit Agricole Indosuez (Geneva), collaterized on TEP-Congo (formerly ELF-Congo) royalty payments; US$60 million of advances (in “p&age”) to the SNPC was settled. Repayments of US$280 million are to be made through TEP-Congo with 1.5 million barrels annually, on average (implying a ten-year repayment schedule if oil prices were to stabilize at US$l8% per barrel), with additional delivery of 3 million barrels in 2002-03 and abandonment of excess “profit oil.” l Domestic arrears (November 2001). CFAF 105 billion in government bonds was issued, with a ten-year maturity and 3 percent interest rate, to consolidate certified domestic arrears. Note: The restructuring of oil-collaterized debts was a means for the authorities to regain control over the trading of the government’s share of oil exports. Thus, while the new loans remain collaterized on oil exports, they are now arranged through the SNPC rather than private operators. (Developments with respect to the oil- collaterized debt are described in the accompanying background papers.) B. Program Implementation 17. Performance under the authorities’ program in 2001 was poor. The original program for 2001 was laid out in the authorities’ letter of intent for the purpose of making a drawing under the Fund’s post-conflict assistance policy (EBS/00/220, 1 l/7/00). By end-June 200 1, several quantitative and structural indicators had been missed, and the macroeconomic objectives of the program for the year as a whole were no longer achievable. In consultation with Fund staff, the authorities adopted revised program targets for September and December 2001 (see EBS/O1/126, 7/31/01). The timing of the consultation mission did not allow for a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- full assessment of performance under the staff-monitored program at end-September 200 1. However, preliminary estimates point to a worsening of several fiscal indicators during the third quarter of the year, notably as concerns the primary budget balance, mainly on account of public investment outlays (Table 3). In addition, the continued increase in net government borrowing from the banking system suggest that the indicative credit ceiling was probably exceeded. 18. The implementation of structural reforms has lagged behind schedule. As indicated above, performance has been mixed with respect to the structural indicators, which were set in late 2000 under the post-conflict program and revised in June 2001 in the context of a staff-monitored program (see EBS/O1/126,7/3 l/01, Tables 2 and 5). Completion of the bank restructuring, for example, which had been initially targeted for December 2000, was delayed until the third quarter of 200 1 and has subsequently been postponed further. Moreover, the authorities made only limited progress in compiling the data and information required for program-monitoring purposes, which hindered the regular monitoring of developments by the staff. III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 19. Against this background, the discussions focused on the main policy challenges facing the Congolese authorities in 2001 and over the medium term. The staff expressed concern over the turnaround of the net foreign assets position in 200 1, and sought to assess whether this called for changes in the macroeconomic policy stance. Beyond the specific elements of the 2002 budget-which was submitted to the National Transition Council during the mission’s stay in Brazzaville--the staff discussed the features of the authorities’ strategy to correct past slippages and lay the basis for sustained economic growth over the medium term. 20. The consultation discussions yielded consensus views on most policy issues. However, differing approaches emerged regarding management of the oil sector and, in particular, the role of the SNPC. The authorities indicated their willingness to pursue further the discussions with Fund and Bank staff on this issue to bridge any substantive divergence of view. 21. The authorities emphasized their determination to move quickly to a program that could be supported by a PRGF arrangement, and to prepare a request for debt relief under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative) as soon as conditions permit. The staff indicated that consideration of a program that could be supported by a three-year PRGF arrangement would be subject to satisfactory performance under the program at end-200 1, including, in particular, implementation of measures to strengthen management of the oil sector.

The mission welcomed the restoration of peace, the launching of a democratization process, and the rapid reconstruction of the country. Continued social peace and political stability were clearly essential conditions for economic development. At the same time, the mission noted that sustained economic development would help foster peace and stability. This fact called for diversifying the economy away from the oil sector, managing the oil rent and public finance generally in a transparent and rational manner, and implementing a wide array of structural reforms to promote sustainable growth and poverty reduction. 23. The contraction in the Congo’s net foreign assets position was worrisome. In the authorities’ view, this was unlikely to present serious difficulties in monetary and exchange rate management, given the strength of the BEAC’s overall position. The staff noted that the drop in the Congo’s external reserves position was surprising, considering that other CEMAC oil-producing countries had been contributing to a marked foreign assets buildup since late 1999.9 The Congo’s peculiar situation was indicative of an unsustainable public sector position. In effect, the government had increased its indebtedness to the domestic banking system, while public enterprises-reflecting almost entirely movements in the SNPC’s accounts-had drawn down deposits on a large scale (Box 2 and Figure 2). Box 2. Change in Net Foreign Assets and Liabilities, 2000-01 (In billions of CFA francs) 2000 2001 Jan. 2000- Jan.-Dec. Jan.-Sep.

The recovery was accompanied by price stability, with average inflation below 1 percent in 2000-01. The source of growth, however, was predominantly in construction, with a major impetus provided by public investment. The authorities acknowledged that such a strategy was vulnerable to a downturn in international oil prices, which could result in a sharp drop in budget revenue. Little margin for maneuver would then be available, as the government had used up its potential for domestic borrowing, while its capacity to mobilize external funding had not yet been restored (in view of the continued delay in normalizing relations with external partners, the World Bank excepted). Moreover, the overriding priority placed on public investment projects-epitomized by the earmarking of oil revenue-not only greatly complicated budget management but also translated into the accumulation of payments arrears on both external and domestic commitments (including civil service wages). B. Oil Sector Transactions 25. The staff could not assess developments in the oil sector in a comprehensive manner. Available data were inadequate to derive sound balance of payments estimates and assess the performance of the SNPC. While private oil operators provide extensive data to the Ministry of Finance and the central bank, these are based on fiscal concepts (“cost oil” and “profit oil” concepts) that do not reflect actual transactions. At the time of the mission, the SNPC was still preparing financial accounts, which delayed initiation of its audit. The authorities did not fully account for the drawing of oil-collaterized debt in June 2000, explain the rationale for the debt-restructuring operation of September 200 1, nor provide information on the fluctuations in the SNPC’s bank deposits during 2000-O 1. Moreover, the authorities did not discuss in advance with Fund staff the September refinancing agreement, as specified in the letter to the Managing Director of July 27,200 1. 26. The mission welcomed the signing of a framework agreement between the state and the SNPC. This agreement defines the scope of the SNPC’s activities and sets rules for transferring oil revenue to the government (Box 3). As finalized in June 200 1, however, the agreement was weaker than the draft discussed with World Bank and Fund staff in 2000.10 Although the agreement circumscribed the SNPC’s responsibilities within the upstream oil sector, few steps have been taken to divest its various other ventures (not only CORAF, the refinery, and the petroleum distribution network, which are to be privatized, but also capital shares in the recently set-up commercial bank, COFIPA, in the LINA-CONGO Airline, and other activities unrelated to upstream oil operations). lo In particular, the earlier draft provided for quarterly financial audits, a three-day limit for transfers to the budget, and monthly meetings of an oversight committee to review the SNPC’s operations.

The SNPC will implement the government’s policies and strategies in the hydrocarbons sector, and protect and maintain the state’s assets in the sector; the government remains responsible for the attribution of mining rights. l Sale of crude oil. The SNPC will sell the state’s share in oil output (royalties and profit oil in kind); transfer proceeds to the treasury within eight business days, net of a 1.6 percent fee; and provide detailed information on its trading operations to the Ministry of Finance. l Supervision. Control of the SNPC’s operations will be exercised by the Ministry of Hydro- carbons in technical areas, and by the Ministry of Finance in economic and financial areas. l External audit. The state may request annual financial audits of the SNPC by an internationally recognized firm. 27. The SNPC appears to have generated large financial surpluses, which may preempt treasury oil revenue. The SNPC has acquired substantial shares in most oil fields, representing about 13 percent of the Congo’s oil production. In January 2001, it also purchased 49 percent of an aging field (8meraude) for US$6 million in cash.” While some of these shares have been financed by private oil operators (in “portage”) and may, therefore, yield little net income at present, the size of the SNPC’s bank assets in early 2001 suggests that it generates large cash flows, in addition to the fees levied on the sale of government oi1.12 The staff noted that there was no established dividend policy to ensure that all revenue generated in the oil sector was centralized in the budget and recommended that all participation in oil operations should be managed by the SNPC on behalf of the state, rather than on its own account. The authorities indicated that their policies were designed to increase Congolese involvement in oil development and operations, and that any use of SNPC profits was subject to a decision of its board of directors. C. Fiscal Management 28. The staff noted that a number of objectives set under the 2001 budget were unlikely to have been met. Despite a satisfactory revenue performance overall, the overriding priority placed on public investment projects meant that available resources had not been sufficient to meet current obligations, including civil service wages and nonreschedulable external debt service. In addition to collaterized debt service, which had continued to claim about one-fourth of government oil revenue, contracts had been signed ” kmeraude is now operated jointly by the SNPC and a French company (PERENCO) specializing in recovering oil from less profitable fields. l2 Under the Congo’s fiscal regime, royalties and the government’s share of profit oil (less any amount earmarked for collaterized debt service and other payments) is allotted in kind and marketed by the SNPC. In 2001, the SNPC handled some two-thirds of the budget’s oil receipts. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- through private oil companies and the SNPC to earmark (and thereby guarantee) payments to contractors. Although such off-budget operations had subsequently been recorded in treasury accounts, the staff pointed out that they had breached the principle of centralizing all revenue at the treasury and prevented effective cash management. 29. Progress was made in 2001 in non-oil revenue collection, but problems remain, especially at customs. A wide range of measures is being implemented to strengthen the revenue collection agencies, notably as a follow-up to the May 2001 FAD technical assistance mission. The tax directorate has undertaken to extend the responsibilities of the large-taxpayers unit, which should be fully operational in 2002. Efforts are also under way to develop cross-links between the tax and customs directorates, and to extend taxpayer registration in the informal sector. Progress was recorded in the third quarter of 2001 as collaboration was improved between the customs administration and the import certification agency (BIVAC), and computerization was to have been completed before the end of the year. The authorities agreed on the need to narrow tax and customs exemptions, and to step up efforts to combat fraud at customs. 30. Despite restrictive measures adopted in midyear, expenditure outstripped budget projections in 2001. For the year as a whole, primary expenditure was projected to have exceeded budget allocations by 10 percent, reaching the equivalent of 21 percent of GDP. Nearly all expenditure categories registered overruns, including the wage bill, centrally paid outlays (charges communes) and domestically financed investment. The authorities ascribed the overruns to pressing needs relating to the peace and reconciliation process and reconstruction. They also noted a need to strengthen budget controls and indicated that a request for urgent technical assistance to this effect would be sent to the Fund. 31. The draft 2002 budget is broadly consistent with the priorities set under the authorities’ post-conflict program drawn up in late 2000 (Table 3). Nevertheless, the outlook for the international oil market has been particularly uncertain, and oil revenue projections assume average oil prices (US$21 per barrel for the Brent reference) that could well turn out overoptimistic. In the staffs view, the non-oil revenue objective for 2002 (up 17 percent from 2001) appears ambitious and is contingent on an early adjustment in the retail prices of petroleum products, which so far have been heavily subsidized. Projections for current expenditure are tight, especially considering the cost of organizing elections (CFAF 20% billion). The primary surplus (6.5 percent of GDP) projected in 2002 would allow the full servicing of nonreschedulable debt. l3 Given the limited room to maneuver on current spending, the staff urged the authorities to prioritize public investment and to defer lower-priority projects in case of a substantial revenue shortfall.14 l3 The authorities are also committed to reducing the stock of nonreschedulable arrears and planned to make a down payment of CFAF 2 billion to the AfDB in December 200 1. I4 With oil prices lower by US$l per barrel, government revenue would fall by CFAF 18 billion, or about 1 percent of GDP, in 2002.

Monetary and credit policies are conducted by the BEAC in the regional context of the CEMAC. Overall-with the notable exception of the Congo-the monetary authorities have been faced with an excess liquidity in the region, which prompted an activation of mandatory reserve requirements in September 200 1. l5 As regards the specifics of the Congo, BEAC representatives emphasized the importance of strengthening fiscal management and the urgency of restoring a fully functioning payments system. Assuming full implementation of the government’s budget and an upturn in broad money demand, the Congo’s net foreign assets are projected to recover in 2002 and return close to the end-2000 level. 33. The Congolese authorities intend to complete the restructuring and privatization of commercial banks rapidly. At present, the Congo’s banking system cannot fulfill its role of financial intermediation and provides only limited functionality as far as the payments system is concerned (one bank is excluded from clearing mechanisms). In view of the difficulties encountered in finalizing negotiations for the sale of two commercial banks (the CAIC and the BIDC), the authorities intend to step up their efforts to reach understandings with private investors. In case negotiations cannot be completed rapidly, tenders would be issued, with a view to identifying new partners. The staff emphasized the urgency of completing the restructuring of commercial banks, and urged the authorities to consider liquidating any bank that could not be privatized. 34. The CEMAC’s Council of Ministers recently decided to phase out direct central bank advances to governments. The ceiling on the BEAC’s statutory advances will be reduced by one-tenth on January 1,2003 and thereafter by the same amount annually over ten years. Unless advances can be repaid in cash, governments will need to issue securities, such as treasury bills, at market rates, which could prove difficult in countries such as the Congo where the credibility of fiscal policy has not been restored. During a transition period of at least three years, the BEAC will provide guarantees (at penalty interest rates) on national treasury bills up to the amount of the statutory ceiling at end-2002. World Bank plans to conduct a comprehensive public expenditure review in 2002). While many projects carried out in 2000-01 were of high priority (e.g., the dredging of the port of Pointe-Noire, the critical repair of railway tunnels and bridges, and road work), others may have been less important or urgent. Moreover, the authorities recently started construction work on a new airport in the northern part of the country (near Ollombo) that is likely to remain unprofitable for many years to come. l5 The mandatory reserve ratio was set at a low level (1 percent on sight deposits and 0.5 percent on term deposits), with a minimal remuneration (1.2 percent, as against a base rate of 7 percent).

With international oil prices averaging US$28 per barrel in 2000 and about US$24 per barrel in 2001 (World Economic Outlook (WEO) benchmark), oil exports accounted for some 93 percent of exports receipts in both years. Other exports consist mostly of logs, and there is little scope at present for diversifying the export base. l6 As indicated above, balance of payments statistics are subject to a large degree of uncertainty, reflecting the poor quality of data in the oil sector.17 36. The trade and payments system is largely free of restrictions. The index of trade restrictiveness is estimated at 3 (on the standard l-10 scale, with 1 being the least restrictive), based on a moderate tariff level (16 percent unweighted average) and few nontariff barriers (eight essential consumer goods are subject to import licensing requirements). CEMAC regulations provide for a relatively liberal exchange system, with documentation requirements for current account transactions and limitations on capital movements. F. Structural Reforms 37. A vast program of public enterprise privatization was launched in 2000, but progress has remained limited so far. The status of the program is summarized in Box 4. 38. The authorities are striving to improve control over the civil service and the wage bill. An audit of staffing levels undertaken in mid-2000 yielded a preliminary report in July 2001. Following controls designed to reconcile the listings of the Ministry of Civil Service with the payroll roster, the government suspended the pay of 9,210 civil servants (out of some 7 1,000 government employees, including military personnel) in October 200 1, but most were subsequently reinstated. The 2001 wage bill was projected at about CFAF 120 billion, compared with an initial budget allocation of CFAF 104 billion. Recruitment took place during the first half of the year, principally to integrate former militiamen and regularize the situation of teachers previously paid through transfer budgets. l6 A Canadian firm is exploring the possibility of developing magnesium mining and processing in the western Congo, but this project is unlikely to materialize before the middle of the decade. I7 The timing for recording imports and direct foreign investment is dependent on oil prices, as it relates to the concept of cost oil (equal to 50 percent of the oil export price, up to a ceiling of about US$25 per barrel). Problems in measuring the current account balance naturally translate into similar uncertainties about national accounts estimates. The investment and saving data presented in Table 1 should, therefore, be considered with caution. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- Box 4.

A series of legal and regulatory reforms is under way. New texts were issued in 2001 (e.g., a law setting up two separate entities for posts and telecommunications, and codes on electricity and water, in July; a law on retail petroleum distribution, in October), and others are being finalized (e.g., by-laws of autonomous ports and the river transport authority, and a telecommunications code). The authorities are considering adopting the CEMAC’s investment charter, which sets guidelines for promoting private investment without excessive tax incentives, and revising various laws to conform with the treaty harmonizing business law in Africa (the OHADA Treaty). G. Poverty Reduction Strategy 40. The authorities have decided to make the fight against poverty the cornerstone of their development policy. They are drafting an interim poverty reduction strategy paper (Interim PRSP), which they intend to finalize in the coming months. The initial draft, prepared in collaboration with the UNDP, unions, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), emphasizes the need to develop basic infrastructure, and step up education and health services, especially in rural areas. The Interim PRSP is also intended as a vehicle to mobilize donor support (a donors’ conference is planned in early 2002), and a basis for a new PRGF arrangement and possible consideration of exceptional debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- 41. Highly preliminary estimates of HIPC Initiative debt relief were prepared by the authorities in May 200 1, as part of a workshop jointly organized by the Congolese authorities, the BEAC, and Debt Relief International. On the basis of several scenarios, and using budget projections for 2001, the amount of debt relief in net present value terms (NPV) that would lower the debt-service ratios below the standard thresholds was estimated at about US$SSO million.” While the staff has compiled a loan-by-loan database of external debt, work on a debt sustainability analysis could not be completed in view of the serious flaws in the balance of payments data and insufficient information on oil sector transactions. H. Medium-Term Outlook 42. The staff has prepared a macroeconomic scenario for 2002-06, based in part on the authorities’ 2002 budget but using the latest WE0 assumptions (Table 7). Most important, the average oil price is projected at US$l8.5 per barrel in 2002 and US$l9 there- after, as against an assumed price of US$21 per barrel in the 2002 budget. Government oil revenue is thus projected to fall from an expected CFAF 450 billion in 2001 to about CFAF 3 10 billion in 2002, or CFAF 41 billion lower than projected under the 2002 budget (Table 3). 43. Overall GDP growth is expected to slow from 7.9 percent in 2000 and 3.3 percent in 2001 to 1.5 percent in 2002. Oil output is set to decline slightly in 2002 and more markedly in 2003, before recovering in 2004, when new fields come onstream. Non-oil GDP growth would return to more sustainable levels of 3%--4 percent annually from 2002 onward. Although inflation in partner countries is expected to remain at about 2 percent annually, the Congo’s consumer prices are projected to surge temporarily in 2002, as a result of a marked adjustment in the retail prices of petroleum products. The external current account is expected to turn from a surplus of 5% percent of GDP in 2001 to a deficit of a similar magnitude in 2002 (Table 7). Total exports are projected to drop by 28 percent in CFA franc terms in 2002, mainly reflecting lower export prices, while imports would grow slightly as a result of a sustained increase in non-oil private sector activity. 44. The Congo’s macroeconomic outlook is clouded by the large stock of external debt arrears. Total arrears were projected at more than CFAF 2,000 billion (US$3 billion) at end-2001, accounting for 55 percent of total external debt (Table 6). Factoring the payment of nonreschedulable arrears, the 2002 residual financing gap is projected to reach CFAF 360 billion, or the equivalent of US$500 million. This projection disregards any secondary impact on non-oil revenue and assumes that the authorities fully compensate for I8 This estimate is based on the fiscal criterion, i.e., the amount of debt relief that would lower the ratio of the NPV of external debt to government revenue to 250 percent, after application in full of existing debt-relief mechanisms (including the rescheduling of pre-cutoff-date bilateral debt on Naples terms).

Medium-term projections are highly sensitive to oil price assumptions. With average oil prices higher (or lower) by US$2 per barrel over the projection period, nominal GDP would be raised (or reduced) by about US$200 million annually, and the financing gap would be smaller (or larger) by more than US$60 million. Over the 2002-06 period, average oil prices of US$l7 per barrel-rather than US$l9, as assumed under the baseline scenario- would result in a residual financing gap larger by US$335 million cumulatively. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 46. Recent developments in the Congo have been encouraging in many respects. Peace has been restored; a process of democratization has been initiated; major steps have been taken to rebuild a functioning administration; and economic activity has recovered. This turnaround, following the devastation of recurrent episodes of civil war in the 199Os, has been engineered by the Congolese themselves, with very limited outside help. 47. Performance under the authorities’ economic and financial program has been disappointing, however. While government oil revenue has exceeded projections, non-oil revenue collection has fallen short of target (mainly reflecting a lackluster performance at customs), and the implementation of structural reforms is behind schedule. A number of objectives set under the post-conflict program of November 2000 could not be met, and the policy framework was revised in June 200 1 in the context of a staff-monitored program. Preliminary estimates suggest that fiscal performance remained below target at end- September. 48. The Congo’s overall financial situation weakened in 2001. Net foreign assets fell sharply during the first half of the year, and little headway was made in restoring normal relations with external partners. There were overruns on budget expenditure, and, despite substantial recourse to domestic bank financing, arrears built up on domestic obligations- including the wage bill-and external debt service. Increases in the government’s indebtedness were compounded by a drop in public enterprise deposits, as the national oil company (SNPC) spent funds accumulated in late 2000. Treasury cash management has also been hampered by the earmarking of government oil revenue-in addition to oil-collaterized debt service-for direct payments of public investment projects. By late 2001, the public sector position was fragile, as the government had used up its potential for domestic borrowing, while its capacity to mobilize external funding had not been restored. lg The residual gap takes into account assumed debt relief on eligible arrears and current maturities. The CFA franc estimates are presented here in U.S. dollar equivalents, rather than in percent of GDP, as fluctuations in oil prices translate into large swings in nominal GDP estimates.

Oil operators compile statistics on the basis of fiscal returns that mismatch actual imports, profit remittances, and direct foreign investment. At the time of the mission, the SNPC was finalizing its 2000 accounts-which delayed the launching of its financial audit-and could not clarify the rationale for drawing down its bank deposits during the first half of 200 1. The staff urges the authorities to improve the monitoring and control of oil sector transactions, and ensure full transparency in the operations of the SNPC. 50. The magnitude of transactions handled by the SNPC suggests that the Congo’s financial surpluses from oil exports are in part managed off budget. The oil-collaterized debt-restructuring operations conducted in June 2000 and September 2001 not only resulted in higher debt levels, but also transferred contingent SNPC liabilities to the budget. The rationale for these operations remains unclear: the former operation shortened the amortization schedule, but the latter lengthened it; the new debt contracted in June 2000 carried a higher interest rate margin than the debt it replaced; and the terms of the latest contract cannot be analyzed in purely financial terms, as they pertain in part to oil business operations. The staff considers that the government should exercise greater oversight of the SNPC, narrow the scope of its activities to the upstream oil sector, and ensure that profits from participation are transferred to the budget regularly (e.g., on a quarterly basis). The staff also recommends dismantling the system of earmarking oil revenue, which would enable the treasury to regain control over cash management. 51. The draft 2002 budget is broadly consistent with the priorities set under the 2000 post-conflict program. However, budget projections are based on a relatively high oil price assumption (US$21 per barrel), which may well turn out optimistic (the latest WE0 assumption is US$18.5 per barrel). Were the need to arise, it will be essential for the authorities to implement rapid cuts in expenditure or to defer spending-including public investment projects-of lesser priority. In addition, sustained efforts will be needed to improve fiscal management, especially to tighten expenditure control and raise non-oil revenue collection. In this respect, it will be important for the authorities to move rapidly with a comprehensive review of public expenditure with the help of World Bank staff. 52. The Congo remains excessively dependent on oil revenue and thus highly vulnerable to changes in international market conditions. Progress in implementing structural reforms has remained limited so far. The authorities need to accelerate implementation of structural reforms if the country is to diversify its export base and develop import substitution industries. In the short run, it is particularly important to complete the restructuring and sale of commercial banks, so as to restore a fully functioning payments system. Stepped-up efforts are also needed in the area of public enterprise privatization. The staff recognizes that divesting or leasing out large enterprises-such as those in the water, electricity, transportation, or telecommunications subsectors-takes time and depends in part on the willingness of potential private investors. In the meantime, the authorities need to demonstrate convincingly their commitment to reform the economy by conducting swiftly and transparently more modest operations (like the sale of hotels). It Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- will also be important to launch a comprehensive reform of the civil service, in order to improve the efficiency of government services and strengthen control over the wage bill. 53. The authorities are developing a poverty reduction strategy as a vehicle to mobilize donor support, and to submit a request for exceptional debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative as soon as conditions permit. The staff shares the authorities’ concern over the deterioration of the Congo’s social indicators during the 1990s and hopes that determined efforts to reduce poverty can begin soon. Fund support in the context of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility would be subject to satisfactory progress in program implementation at end-2001. In this context, the staff considers of the utmost urgency that the authorities take measures to strengthen governance, including, in particular, by improving transparency and accountability in the oil sector. 54. The Congo’s statistical base is weak and does not allow a comprehensive exercise of Fund surveillance. The staff urges the authorities to address this deficiency as a matter of urgency, and hopes that technical assistance from the Fund and bilateral donors will be used to the fullest extent possible. 55. It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the Republic of Congo will be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

A Stage Two (on-site) safeguards assessment of the BEAC proposed specific remedies to alleviate vulnerabilities identified by staff. The authorities have committed themselves to implementing most of the proposed remedies, as described in the following sections. Safeguards areas and main remedies The external audit mechanism. The auditing function and the quality control procedures of the external auditor are adequate. The safeguards assessment proposed that (i) the external auditor refer explicitly to the international standards of auditing (ISA) in giving its opinion; (ii) the external auditor become more cognizant of the accounting rules applicable to the recording of the Fund’s balances; and (iii) the BEAC should include the audit opinion in the annual publication of the financial statements. The management of the BEAC has agreed to implement these actions for the fiscal year (FY) 2002 accounts. Legal structure and independence. The legislation governing BEAC is adequate. Financial reporting. The monthly statements of the bank’s financial position are not published in any form, and the December 3 1,200O audited financial statements were not published in a timely manner. The staff recommended that the BEAC (i) enhance the readability and the credibility of the published annual accounts by including detailed explanatory notes on the accounting methods followed, and by indicating whether these methods referred explicitly to a generally accepted accounting framework; (ii) adopt international accounting standards; and (iii) change the accounting of some of its operations with the Fund, especially with regard to the revaluation of the IMF accounts. The management of the BEAC has agreed to implement these recommendations by FY 2002. Internal audit mechanism. The quality of the personnel, the rigorous methods followed for the audit of branches, the training program in place, and the risk assessment methods in place are satisfactory. However, certain weaknesses remain, and the staff recommended that the BEAC (i) establish a charter for the Internal Audit Department (IAD); (ii) expand the audit scope and coverage of the IAD to include activities at headquarters; (iii) prepare an annual rolling multiyear audit program describing risk assessment, activities scheduled, and staffing and financial resources required; and (iv) increase the number of qualified staff. In its response to the Stage Two report, the management of the BEAC has specifically agreed to expand the scope and coverage of the audit department and increase the number of qualified staff. A charter for the audit department will also be prepared, with the assistance of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - APPENDIX II Fund staff, which will provide the BEAC with the relevant documentation. A gradual implementation of these recommendations should be completed by end-2002. The management of the BEAC did not specifically cover in its answer to the report the recommendation related to the risk-based rolling multiyear audit program. The system of internal controls. On the whole, the risks are relatively well captured, although uncertainties exist because of insufficient a posteriori controls exercised on some activities at headquarters. The bank has a codified system of rules, selects its personnel carefully, maintains a segregation of duties in the branches, and has recently increased resources for control purposes. Nevertheless, the staff recommended that the BEAC (i) strengthen the coordination among the audit bodies; (ii) examine in-depth the segregation of duties at headquarters; and (iii) put in place a more systematic follow-up of all recommendations made by the external auditor to allow the Governor and the Board of Directors to better exercise their oversight responsibilities. In its response to the Stage Two report, the management of the BEAC has agreed to establish an audit committee by 2002. Regarding the proposed segregation of duties, the management noted that an internal assessment was under way, but that for budgetary reasons a formal audit could not be undertaken before end-2002. Regarding the late payments of Fund obligations, which has been an issue for all of the BEAC’s member countries at some time in the last three years, the staff concluded that, while the BEAC’s own payment procedures and related management controls in this area were functioning adequately, procedures should be modified with respect to the BEAC’s relations with member countries. The staff recommended that the BEAC should repay the Fund directly, using its own resources for those countries with borrowing capacity with the central bank; for countries facing fiscal difficulties, the staff recommended that they at least maintain sufficient borrowing capacity with the BEAC to repay IMF obligations falling due within the next year. In its answer to the Stage Two Report, the management of the BEAC did not follow the mission’s recommendation that the BEAC should repay the Fund directly. The management also commented that, apart from direct statutory advances to treasuries, the BEAC could not grant loans to member countries.

The civil strife of 1997 and December 1998-October 1999 inflicted severe damage on administrative infrastructure, and many records and documents were lost. Also, statistical surveys could not be conducted. Hence, data for the 1996-99 period are incomplete or do not exist. The current coverage of the Congo’s statistics is described below. Social statistics are virtually nonexistent. A resident IMF statistical advisor started a one-year assignment in November 2001, in order to revisit the macroeconomic accounts; in that connection his primary aim will be to record the operations of the oil industry. A multisector statistical mission is scheduled to visit Brazzaville in March or April 2002. National accounts 2. Although real sector data are presently not reported to the Statistics Department on a timely basis, the authorities provide Fund missions with a breakdown of GDP on an output, income, and expenditure basis, both in nominal and real terms. These data are prepared by the Directorate General of Statistics (DGS) of the Ministry of Finance. Historically, data on oil sector transactions have been weak, reflecting a lack of transparency on the part of the oil companies operating in the country and the government agencies dealing with them. During the 2000 Article IV consultations, the DGS provided national accounts data for 1996-99 that were largely estimated and contained internal inconsistencies. Consistency was lacking also with balance of payments data. Employment and unemployment 3. Annual data on employment in the central government are available from the Ministry of Finance, but they are not fully consistent with data from the civil service roster of the Ministry of the Civil Service. As part of the structural reforms undertaken in the context of the post-conflict program, the government completed an audit of public service employees (end-December 2000) and developed cross-links between the civil service database and payroll roster (end-June 2001). Data on employment in the private sector are not available. Prices 4. Movements in the prices of items consumed by households are recorded in the capital city of Brazzaville (base-year 1977) and the second-largest city of Pointe Noire (base-year 1996). Data are compiled on a monthly basis. Both indices are based on a consumption basket survey of 1964 that is heavily weighted toward foodstuffs (Brazzaville, 58 percent, and Pointe Noire, 63 percent) and needs to be updated.

Data on government revenue, expenditure, and the overall fiscal position are available on a monthly basis. Historically, the coverage of commitment and cash basis data has been incomplete. In addition, during the conflicts of 1997 and December 1998-October 1999 established budgetary procedures were largely ignored, and a large part of outlays was paid without prior commitment through advances from the treasury. 6. Some progress has been made regarding submissions for publication in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook. The latest data reported are for 2000 (including a forecast for 2001). They are, predominantly, on a commitment basis and cover most of central government and, tentatively, local government. No subannual data are currently reported to International Financial Statistics (IFS). While data on expenditure by function are not yet transmitted, some information is available on the activities of individual enterprises. However, no systematic data are collected on the performance of the public enterprise sector as a whole, which makes it difficult to fully assess the impact of this sector’s activities on the fiscal and monetary accounts. 7. In 2000, the government began to put in place a system to strengthen the mechanisms for controlling and monitoring expenditure. In February 2000, the organic budget law was adopted by the National Transition Council (parliament), and the government accounting decree was signed on August 10,200O. Implementation of these legislative and regulatory measures, combined with the partial rehabilitation of computer systems, has contributed to an improvement in the quality and timeliness of budget data. Expenditure data on a payments order basis (ordonnancements) are now available with a two-month lag. Further improvements are needed to produce the data on a functional and commitment basis and to improve the monitoring of treasury payments. Monetary accounts 8. Monthly data on monetary statistics for the Republic of Congo, as well as for the other members of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), are regularly reported to the Fund in electronic form by the regional central bank (BEAC), albeit with two- to three-month delays. Coverage is comprehensive, but accuracy is affected by large cross-border movements of currency among CEMAC member countries. External and domestic debt 9. The Caisse Congolaise d’Amortissement (CCA) produces comprehensive data on the outstanding stock of external public debt, including arrears, and its composition, together with detailed projections on debt service due. These data are provided to Fund missions. The debt-stock data cannot be fully reconciled with flow data in the balance of payments. The CCA also produces domestic debt data.

The BEAC is responsible for the collection and the dissemination of balance of payments data in the Republic of Congo. The balance of payments data are annual and have been prepared through 1994 in accordance with the Balance ofPayments Manual (4’h ed.). The BEAC provides annual data on exports of goods and services and on capital flows other than public debt. Recent data (for the first time on the basis of the Balance ofpayments Manual (5’h ed.) were revised and updated for the period 1995-99. During the June 2001 staff visit, the Fund technical expert identified several flaws in the compilation of balance of payments statistics, largely related to the treatment of transactions in the oil sector and in the financial account. The BEAC was recording some financial transactions of the oil sector from stock variations valued in CFA francs vis-a-vis nonresidents between the beginning and the end of the exercise. In addition, net investment flows are overestimated because of significant unrecorded disinvestment operations that are part of the tax regime arrangements obtained by oil-drilling nonresident companies. The Fund’s resident expert, who took up his assignment in November 2001, is to assist the authorities in developing an appropriate methodology for compiling balance of payments statistics. Public enterprise sector 11. There is no centralized, comprehensive database on the operations of public enterprises. However, some information has been made available to Fund missions by individual enterprises. Data are on an annual basis and become available with at least six months’ delay.

Following the ceasefire agreement of December 1999, the authorities launched a vast program of reconstruction and rehabilitation of basic infrastructure. A democratization process is under way with a constitutional referendum scheduled in January 2002, with presidential and legislative elections to follow in March and May. Economic activity recovered strongly in 2000-O 1, while prices remained broadly stable. Real non-oil GDP growth was 16 percent in 2000 (albeit from a low base), and was estimated at 9 percent in 200 1. Overall GDP growth was significantly lower, reflecting declining oil output. The pickup in activity reflected mainly a surge in construction, but also strong expansion in forestry, transportation, and trade. Thanks to the rehabilitation of the port of Pointe Noire and the railway link with Brazzaville, the supply of goods improved markedly and consumer prices declined slightly, on average, in 200 1. The budget balance turned into a surplus in 2000-01. Government revenue exceeded program projections in 2000 and during the first nine months of 200 1, as shortfalls in non-oil revenue collection (notably at customs) were more than offset by higher-than-projected receipts from the oil sector. Expenditure outstripped budget allocations, reflecting higher- than-planned outlays for security purposes, the recruitment of civil servants, the large cost of organizing the national dialogue, and overruns in public investment outlays. As a result, the primary surplus was short of target by 2.1 percent of GDP in 2000 and 0.8 percent in 2001. The lower-than-projected budget surplus translated into a buildup of arrears. Despite recourse to domestic bank financing and the postponement of a domestic arrears clearance operation, the treasury cash position remained tight through September 200 1 and arrears accumulated, including on civil service wages. The resources available for external debt service were also less than projected. With the bulk of external debt-service payments earmarked for the oil-collaterized debt (83 percent in 2000, and an estimated 57 percent in 2001), the authorities could not sustain their commitment to meet nonreschedulable debt service obligations from mid-2000 onward, and external arrears built up further, including on multilateral and post-cutoff-date bilateral debt. The external debt stock was estimated at 186 percent of GDP at end-200 1, with about half of the total in arrears (including nearly US$300 million in nonreschedulable arrears). The Congo’s net foreign asset position fell sharply in 2001 (by US$200 million during January-September). This reflected both an increase in net government credit and the drawdown of deposits by the national oil company (SNPC) that had built up in the last few months of 2000.

These estimates are highly uncertain, however, not only because of incomplete data on oil sector transactions but also reflecting doubts over the nature of data reported by oil companies. Progress in the implementation of structural reforms has been limited. The signing of a framework agreement between the government and the SNPC, in June 2001, opened the way for a financial audit of the company. In other areas, one commercial bank was privatized in February 2001, but the sale of two other commercial banks was delayed. The public enterprise privatization program is also behind schedule, in part reflecting a lack of interest from potential investors. In the case of retail petroleum distribution, effective privatization was subject to finalizing a revised law (issued in October) and adjusting retail prices. In the area of civil service reforms, efforts at controlling staffing levels and the wage bill were hindered by the recruitment of former militia members into the army and various public administrations. The 2002 draft budget is broadly consistent with the priorities set under the authorities’ post- conflict program drawn up in late 2000. The projected primary budget surplus would allow the full servicing of nonreschedulable debt. However, budget projections are based on a relatively optimistic assumption for average oil prices; lower-than-expected international oil prices could complicate achievement of fiscal objectives for 2002. The Republic of Congo joined the IMF on July 10, 1963 and its quota is SDR 84.6 million (about US$lO8.1 million). As of end-November 200 1, the Republic of Congo’s outstanding use of IMF financing was SDR 20.8 million (about US$26.6 million).
