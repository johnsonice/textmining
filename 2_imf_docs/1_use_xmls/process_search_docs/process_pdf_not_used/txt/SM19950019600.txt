Backpround and Recent DeveloDments 1/ Chile's economy performed strongly in the period 1990 to 1993 in a context of prudent, market-oriented economic policies. Real GDP growth was robust (averaging 7 percent a year), inflation declined from 27 percent in 1990 to 12 percent in 1993, and the public finances were in surplus (Table 1 and Chart 1). Over the same period Chile experienced large capital inflows, and foreign reserves increased substantially (gross reserves rose to about nine months of imports of goods and nonfactor services by end-1993) and the Chilean peso appreciated by about 12 percent in real effective terms (Chart 2). In concluding the 1994 Article IV consultation on July 29, 1994, Directors commended the authorities for pursuing sound macroeconomic policies which had led to high growth rates and a strong external position. Directors stressed the importance of lowering inflation to industrial country levels while maintaining a strong economic performance. They welcomed the authorities' tight monetary policy and their commitment to achieve larger savings than envisaged in the budget projections, but they emphasized that achievement of the inflation objective would be facilitated by reducing the scope of indexation. Chile's increased flexibility in the management of the exchange rate since 1990, including through several revaluations, was encouraged by some Directors, but other Directors called for fixing the exchange rate. Directors recommended that the authorities take advantage of Chile's strong external position to further liberalize foreign exchange transactions, and encouraged the Government to continue with structural reforms and the fight against poverty. With output growth acceleratfng to 11 percent 1n 1992 and inflation remaining at around 13 percent, during 1993 and 1994 the authorities pursued policies aimed at curbing excessive demand pressures. 2/ The surplus of the combined public sector tncreased from 0.8 percent of GDP in 1993 to 1.2 percent in 1994 (Table 2) while the Central Bank kept the interest rate on its inflation-indexed go-day notes at 6 l/2 percent during 1993 and most of 1994. As demand pressures subsided and inflation was within the target range of 9 percent to 11 percent, the Central Bank lowered the interest rate 1/ The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Chile were conducted in Santiago during June 12-21, 1995. The staff representatives were Mr. Duran-Downing (Head), Mr. Ferngndez, Ms. Guerguil, Mr. Kaune (all WHD), Mr. Vegh (RES), and Miss Eyzaguirre (Assistant-WHD). The representatives of Chile in the discussions included Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat, Central Bank President Roberto Zahler, the Superintendent of Banks, and other senior officials. Mr. Leiva, Advisor to the Executive Director, also participated in the discussions. A staff team visited Santiago during November 29- December 7, 1994 to discuss developments in 1994 and the outlook for 1995. 2/ A detailed description of developments in the period 1990-94 is presented in the paper on recent economic developments (to be issued shortly).

The Central Bank also sold its notes in the open market to limit the impact of short-term capital inflows, particularly during the last quarter of 1994. In response to the tight financial policies, real GDP growth slowed to 6.3 percent in 1993 and further to 4 .;I percent in 1994 while unemployment, which stood at 4.5 percent of the labor force in 1992-93, rose to almost 6 percent in the last quarter of 1994. Inflation fell from 12.2 percent to 8.9 percent during the year helped by the slack in aggregate demand and the currency appreciation. With a strong recovery in the prices of Chile's main commodity exports, the external current account deficit declined from 4 l/2 percent of GDP in 1993 to about 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 (Table 4). The net international reserves of the Central Bank (excluding valuation changes) increased by USS3.i: billion in 1994 on the strength of capital inflows (gross reserves rose to 11 l/2 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services by the end of the year). The increase in capital inflows; in 1994 was mostly in the form of long-term direct investment and associated loans. However, short-term inflows surged during the last quarter of 1994 as the interbank exchange Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicrate u rose toward the most appreciated limit of the exchange band in response to sharply improved prospects for Chile's exports. In the period October-November 1994, the Central Bank purchased foreign exchange in excess of USS1.7 billion in an attempt to keep the interbank exchange rate within the band. This was followed by a revaluation of the reference rate of 9 l/2 percent on November 30 (Chart 3). In real effective terms, the Chilean peso appreciated by 5 percent during 1994. u The interbank exchange rate in Chile is the rate at which official and most other transactions take place. It is allowed to fluctuate within a band (10 percent on each side) centered on a reference rate. The reference rate is adjusted by the Central Bank daily by the difference between domestic and foreign inflation and is pegged to a fixed basket of currencies composed of the U.S. dollar, the deutsche mark and the Japanese yen. Since 1991 the authorities have implemented five step adjustments in the reference exchange rate for a combined revaluation with respect to the U.S. dollar of about 20 percent. An informal but legal exchange market covers transactions not required to be channeled through the formal interbank market, and the exchange rate in the informal market is freely determined.

Unemployment has remained about unchanged and real wages grew by 5.6 percent during the year ending in May 1995. The 12-month rate of inflation declined to 7.9 percent in July 1995, from 12.3 percent in July 1994. With the maintenance of a tight fiscal policy, interest rates on go-day Central Bank indexed notes were allowed to decline further, to below 5.8 percent in the first two weeks of July 1995. In the wake of the Mexican financial crisis, the stock market fell markedly (by as much as 27 percent on March 9, 1995 compared with December 19, 1994), but it has recovered since then and by end-July 1995 it was 2 percent above its pre-crisis level. u Based on the continued strength of export prices, the trade surplus rose to USS1.3 billion during January-June 1995, compared with US$350 million in the same period of 1994. Foreign direct investment flows and associated loans have continued at a strong pace. These trends were offset in part in the first quarter of 1995 by a reversal of the short-term capital inflows that occurred in late 1994 in the wake of the revaluation of the Chilean peso. Also, there was a net outflow of portfolio investment (mostly equities) related to uncertainties associated with the Mexican crisis. However, the net international reserves of the Central Bank (excluding valuation changes) rose by US$885 million in the period January- June 1995. After some depreciation in the first three months of 1995, the peso appreciated in real effective terms by 4.7 percent during January-May 1995 (the latest data available). II. Policv Discussions The Chilean authorities reaffirmed their intention to continue with prudent flnanc1al policies and to deepen structural reforms with the aLm of reducing inflation to industrial country levels while providing the basis for sustained growth. They were satisfied with the continued strong performance of the economy and the reduction in inflation that was taking place so far in 1995, but they expressed concern about the renewed upward pressures on the currency that resulted from the strength of the external sector and foreign investment. The staff was in broad agreement with the policies that the authorities were implementing, although there were some differences in the relative emphasis that could be given to certain policy instruments. Against this background, the discussions focused on three u Chile has a relatively healthy financial system and effective regulation and supervision. Nonperforming loans rose slightly to 1 percent of the credit portfolio of the banking system at the end of 1994, from 0.8 percent at end-1993. However, the subordinated debt (the portfolio taken over by the Central Bank during the financial crisis of the early 1980s) continues to be a problem, generating quasi-fiscal losses estimated at about 0.3 percent of GDP in 1994 and imposing restrictions on the normal functioning of the banking industry.

This report covers: these issues following a description of the authorities' policies for 1995 and of the medium-term outlook. 1. Policies for 1995 and the medium-term outlook For 1995 as a whole the authorities expect output growth of 6 to 6 l/2 percent and inflati.on of 8 percent. Gross domestic investment is projected to increase somewhat to 27.3 percent of GDP, while national savings would jump by almost 2 percentage points of GDP absorbing most of the effect of a significant improvement in Chile's terms of trade. The authorities' fiscal policy 113 consistent with a surplus in the combined public sector (including the losses of the Central Bank) of 1.2 percent of GDP in 1995 (unchanged from 1994); this compares with a small deficit projected earlier on the basis of the budget assumptions which involved lower copper prices and domestic tax collections. Current revenue is projected to remain at 24.3 percent of GDP, unchanged from last year. There would be some reduction in income tax collections because of the drop in marginal rates contemplated in the tax reform of 1993, but this would be offset by higher excise tax collections. u The operating surplus of the public enterprises would increase by about l/2 percentage point of GDP in 1995 because of higher copper prices and lower operating costs of the copper company, which would about approximately offset a reduction in capital revenue which had been boosted in 1994 by the sale of the Abra copper mine. Total expenditure would increase in line with GDP, with emphasis on social areas (education and pensions) and physical infrastructure. The fiscal projections incorporate the effects of the recent Presidential initiative to raise by 10 percent taxes on gasoline and cigarettes to finance increases in subsidies to education and in minimum pensions equivalent to about 0.3 percent of GDP on an annual basis., On monetary policy the Central Bank has promoted a gradual reduction in market real interest'rates , with the result that banks' lending rates have fallen from 9 percent in October 1994 to 8.3 percent in June 1995. The net domestic assets of the Central Bank are projected to contract markedly during 1995, consistent with an accumulation of net international reserves of USS3.3 billion (including valuation adjustments). The 12-month rate of increase in broad money is projected to decline from 19.3 percent during 1994 to 17.7 percent during 1995 (in line with the projected growth of nominal GDP) while credit to the private sector would rise by 14 percent in real terms. u For a description of the reform, see Chapter I of the paper on recent economic developments (ta be issued shortly).

Regarding the copper sector, the privatization of 51 percent of the electricity generation division of the copper company (CODELCO) has started, but the legal framework for the decentralization and strengthening of management of CODELCO has not been approved yet. Meanwhile, the law on the privatization of the water and sewage companies is awaiting approval by Congress. Congress is also discussing modifications to the regime of concessions to the private sector of infrastructure projects to permit its financing by the pension funds. Discussion of the banking law remains stalled since November 1993. JJ A law that would speed up repayment by commercial banks of the nonperforming loans taken over by the Central Bank during the banking crisis of the early 1980s has.received final clearance by Chile's constitutional court. This law is expected to reduce significantly the cash losses of the Central Bank over the medium term. The Government has sent to Congress legislation aimed at broadening the scope of collective bargaining by (a) restricting the possibility of replacing employees on strike; (b) permitting temporary employees to enter into collective bargaining; and (c) allowing for collective bargaining beyond the level of individual enterprises. As noted earlier, the external sector is projected to strengthen significantly with the current account turning from a deficit of 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 to a small surplus in 1995. Based on present trends the value of copper exports would increase by more than 47 percent in 1995 (17 percent in volume terms because of the coming on stream of private sector projects) and noncopper exports would rise by 22 percent (10 percent in volume terms). The capital account surplus is projected at US$2.2 billion on the continued strength of direct foreign investment and associated long-term financing. As noted, the change in net international reserves is projected to reach USS3.3 billion, including valuation changes. Chile's medium-term outlook appears even more favorable than at the time of the last Article IV consultation. Based on continuation of present economic policies the staff projections envisage an increase in gross domestic investment from about 27 percent of GDP this year to 28 percent by the year 2000. This would be consistent with real GDP growth of about 6 percent a year over the medium term and a gradual decline in inflation to industrial country levels (Table 5). The current account is expected to move back to a deficit as prevailing exceptional circumstances are reversed. However, with public sector savings at about 5 percent of GDP a year and further strengthening of private savings, the external current account deficit would remain somewhat below 2 percent of GDP while the total debt service as percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services would decline J,,/ The discussion of the banking law has been delayed because of previous consideration of the law on the subordinated debt of commercial banks with the Central Bank.

J/ It should be noted that, according to the authorities' estimates an external current account deficit of 3 to 3 l/2 percent of GDP would be sustainable. The current account deficit would be more than financed by private.capital inflows as there would be a small accumulation of foreign reserves and.net repayments of public debt. u The projections assume an increase in net assets of Chilean residents abroad reflecting the Government policy of liberalization of capital outflow, particularly for pension funds. The projections remain sensitive to variations in copper prices and external demand. 1/ 2. Policv issues a. J&alinv with caoital flows and currency anoreciation Continued implementation of sound fiscal and monetary policies over a number of years has helped Chile take advantage of large-scale inflows of medium- and long-term capital. These policies have been supplemented by measures to control and discourage capital inflows, which in the authorities' view have helped avoid excessive short-term capital movements, and have succeeded in lengthening the maturity of the inflows and in mitigating pressures for currency appreciation. In discussing options to deal with the recent upward pressures on the currency associated with the strength of the export sector and direct investment, the authorities indicated that they were considering a tightening of controls on capital inflows. The staff argued against such measures on the grounds that in the .past these controls have not effectively prevented inflows induced by expectations for future revaluation of the L’ World copper prices are projected to decline from USS1.28 a pound in 1995 to USSO. a pound through 1998 as new production projects come on stream, and to continue at that level in real terms thereafter. Copper exports from Chile are expected,to double from their present level to 4.3 million metric tons in .the year 2,000 as investment in new mines mature, while Chile's noncopper exports are assumed to grow by 6 l/2 percent a year in volume terms (the average rise was 12 l/2 percent in the last five years). &/ With respect to relations with the World Bank, the Government is looking at the Bank mainly as a provider of technical assistance and advisory services, in contrast with a source of financing. The F+Y96-98 Bank lending program is estimated at US$115 million with one operation in each fiscal year in the areas of education, rural poverty, infrastructure, and urban/environmental management. J,/ A US$O.lO decline in copper prices with respect to the baseline scenario would increase the external current account deficit by 1 percent of GDP a year. A drop in noncopper export volume growth from 6 l/2 percent a year to 5 percent would increase the current account deficit by about 0.7 percent of GDP a year.

Moreover, controls would not influence the present sources of market pressure-- strong export prices and foreign direct investment. Financial markets also were finding ways to bypass existing regulations and there was a risk that a tightening of regulations would lead to a broadening and an intensification of controls over time. Also, capital controls increase the cost of capital, distort resource allocation, and could be interpreted as a reversal of Chile's policy of gradual opening of the capital account. The mission observed that if additional measures to discourage inflows were to be implemented, it would be important to make them as nondiscretionary and price-based as possible. The staff noted that the problems caused by capital inflows could best be dealt with through a combination of (a) additional fiscal tightening (by trimming certain expenditures and by refraining from spending any additional revenue collected beyond the projected levels) to reduce the burden on monetary policy and facilitate a moderate reduction in interest rates; (b) intervention in the foreign exchange market; and (c) a more aggressive opening of the capital account for Chilean investments abroad. Also, in view of the favorable medium-term outlook there appeared to be room for a moderate further appreciation of the Chilean peso. The authorities felt that fiscal policy was already strong and that their degree of freedom in achieving a higher surplus was limited by the existing tax structure and by the Government's commitment to improve social services. They also noted that further resort to sterilized intervention would increase Central Bank losses, and it could even lead to increased speculation. The authorities were prepared to let the currency appreciate somewhat further, provided that the external position remained favorable. The staff remarked that this could imply the need to abandon the exchange rate band, which could be acting as a trigger for speculative attacks. The Chilean representatives argued that capital controls have been an effective policy tool to smooth out a stock adjustment process of foreign investment in Chile--a process that involved very large inflows in relation to the size of the economy-- and that .further restrictions were appropriate under the current circumstances. They added that there was no conflict between a policy of gradual easing of controls on capital outflows (that would reduce domestic risk through the diversification of assets held abroad by Chilean residents) and measures to introduce temporary restrictions on capital inflows in the context of extraordinarily favorable prices for Chilean commodities. On July 3, 1995, the authorities extended the existing 30 percent reserve requirement on external liabilities to all foreign investments that do not constitute an increase in the capital of Chileans firms, and announced measures to stimulate investment abroad by Chilean institutional investors and banks. In addition, interest rates were allowed to decline further, but no changes were announced in the area of fiscal policy.

Obstacles to a faster reduction of inflation Chile has resorted for many years to widespread indexation in the markets for goods and services, and in labor, financial and exchange markets. Although mandatory wage indexation was abandoned in the early 198Os, collective bargaining continues to be based on past inflation plus a measure of past productivity change. All financial instruments with maturities of more than 90 days are indexed and monetary policy focuses on "real" interest rates. Moreover, exchange rate policy tends to follow a backward-looking real exchange rate rule. JJ Economic policy has thus been implemented without reference to a monetary or exchange rate anchor, which makes the system sensitive to shifts in the public's expectations about inflation. The mission discussed policy alternatives to achieve a more rapid reduction of inflation, including through the removal of deindexation mechanisms. The authorities said that they were satisfied with the reduction of inflation that was taking place. They reiterated that removing indexation of financial assets carried substantial risks (in terms of the potential adverse effect on savings ,with the domestic financial system and on competitiveness). They preferred to continue with the current practice, whereby the Central Bank announces an inflation target (which in their view effectively functions as an anchor to the system) and to wait until the consolidation of inflation at a level comparable to industrial countries makes the existing indexation practices redundant. The authorities thought that as an alternative to the current arrangement a movement toward a fixed exchange rate was inappropriate because of the volatility of commodity prices and capital flows affecting Chile's balance of payments and the need for exchange rate flexibility to sup,port further export growth and diversi- fication. If anything, the authorities could move to a managed float if favorable external conditions were to persist. On labor market indexation, the staff stressed that it was important for the public sector to give a clear signal by effectively anchoring wage negotiations to projected inflation (public wages have increased markedly in the past two years in line with the goal of reducing wage differentials with the private sector). C. Besource allocation and lone-term erowth During the last two decades Chile has implemented wide ranging measures that have contributed significantly to increase productivity and create conditions for the sustained growth of domestic savings and output. Chile remains highly dependent on external conditions, particularly on the prices of copper and certain other key commodities. The authorities' aim is to further enhance Chile's competitiveness and to diversify the country's productive basis beyond copper and other commodity-based activities. To this end, the Government has introduced measures to increase labor lJ Increased flexibility in the application of this rule in recent years has softened the constraint it imposes on disinflation.

Also, the'Government has stepped up public outlays with a view to expanding and upgrading physical infrastructure, and it has taken measures to expand private participation in the financing and operation of infrastructure facilities, i.e. mainly roads and ports. The authorities are seeking to maintain an export-led growth and to increase Chile's participation in world trade and financial flows. Chile maintains a relatively open trade system with a uniform customs tariff of 11 percent, and recently the authorities have attempted to secure access to foreign markets through bilateral and multilateral agreements. Formal negotiations to join NAFTA were initiated in the Toronto ministerial meeting of June 5, 1995. In addition, in early June 1995 Chile renewed existing trade preferences with the countries in Mercosur through the end of the year, and agreed to negotiate a broad agreement as associate member starting in July. In July the European Union agreed to initiate negotiations on a trade agreement. Continuing with the policy of gradual liberalization of foreign transactions, effective July 15, 1995, the authorities eliminated the 50 percent surrender requirement on export proceeds. The staff observed that competitiveness could be further enhanced by moving more decisively in the area of privatization, where progress has been slow in the last few years. The mission also expressed concern that certain features of the draft law on collective bargaining currently in Congress--in particular the extension of negotiations beyond the level of individual firms--could introduce unnecessary rigidities in the labor market. Chile still faces serious problems of poverty and income inequality. To alleviate these problems, the Government has been promoting growth with equity through the implementation of targeted social programs and subsidies, and the percentage of population below the poverty line declined from 40 percent in 1990 to 33 percent in 1992. u Social expenditure grew from 12.8 percent of GDP in 1990 to 13 l/2 percent in 1994, while military expenditure fell from 3.2 percent of GDP to 2.5 percent over the same period. The authorities remain committed to strengthen the provision of social services to the lowest income groups of the population. They also have started to address Chile's environmental problems through the definition of emission and air quality standards, the introduction of environmental impact assessment procedures, and the tightening of existing controls on polluting activities. The spread between the exchange rates in the official and the informal markets has at times exceeded 2 percent, but it has remained below 1 percent in the first half of 1995. Because no current transactions are channeled to the informal market this is not an exchange measure subject to the Fund's u Comparable data for more recent years are not available.

Chile maintains no restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions subject to the Fund's approval under Article VIII. Chile's macroeconomic database is of general high quality and the authorities publish comprehensive economic information on a biweekly basis. In (addition, data on the interbank exchange rate and the stock market is available on a daily basis, and on interest rates on a weekly basis. Starting in the first quarter of 1995 fLsca1 data on central government operations are published quarterly, with a three-month delay. Ad-hoc information on the annual operations of the nonfinancial public sector is prepared for IMF missions. The authorities are ready to cooperate by improving the timeliness and frequency of provision of data on the fiscal area. III. Staff ADDraisaL Chile has continued to implement prudent financial policies that have resulted in a significant reduction in inflation and strong growth of savings, investment, and output, in the context of widespread structural reforms. In addition, the authorities have intensified efforts to improve the provision of public services, address income inequalities and facilitate a more efficient operation of capital markets. Recent measures to raise taxes to finance additi.onal social spending in the context of a healthy fiscal position demonstrate their commitment to prudent fiscal management. Perseverance with these sound economic policies will help to reduce inflation to industrial country levels while maintaining appropriate conditions for the sustained growth of domestic savings and output. Recently, the authorities have broadened the coverage of the reserve requirement on capital inflows to ease renewed pressures for currency appreciation. The staff would encourage the authorities to avoid reliance on capital controls as a permanent deterrent to currency appreciation on grounds of economic efficiency and because the effectiveness of the controls tends to diminish over time, especially in a situation where a significant part of the pressure arises from the strength of the export sector. It would be preferable to confront large capital inflows by combining a more aggressive approach to liberalization of capital outflows with some further appreciation of the currency and a tightening of fiscal policy beyond current plans to ease the burden on monetary policy. The staff's medium-term projections suggests that upward pressures on the currency could persist for some time if external conditions remain favorable for Chile. In these circumstances, it would be important to allow for greater flexibility in exchange rate policy and allow the exchange rate to reflect better market conditions. At the same time there is a need to intensify efforts to create conditions for further increases in productivity in the economy, particularly in the noncopper sector, through a deepening of structural reforms.

Also, the proposed modifications to the regime of concessions for public works should help to fill out the shortage in infrastructure development that the country is currently facing. It would be important to move decisively with restructuring of the state copper company, the privatization of the remaining public enterprises, and the approval of the banking system law. The authorities' prudent stance with regard to indexation is understandable. However, with inflation down to single digits and a favorable outlook for the external sector, Chile appears to be well placed to remove indexation in the economy without major costs. In particular, it will be important to anchor public sector wage negotiations to projected inflation. The recent Central Bank action to use overnight interest rates, while preserving indexation, is a step in the right direction, as it will introduce more flexibility in monetary management. As a further step, it would be advisable to initiate operations in nonindexed instruments so as to pave the way for deindexation in the future. The staff welcomes recent measures to further liberalize external transactions and would encourage the authorities to unify the exchange markets.
