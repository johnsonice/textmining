Transition efforts continued in 1995, supported by the second annual ESAF arrangement. While financial restraint weakened and the program went off track in the first half of 1995, corrective measures were taken at midyear; the Board in November extended the arrangement to March 1996. The end-December fiscal and monetary benchmarks were met. Economic performance in 1995 was satisfactory. Real GDP increased by 6 percent, the external current deficit (excluding official transfers) was held to 7 percent of GDP and net official international reserves rose to 6 weeks of imports. However, the inflation rate of 53 percent in the year to December was higher than programmed. Policies for 1996 aim at Cuther reducing inflation and revitalizing structural change. Reforms focus on public enterprises, especially through energy price adjustments and faster cash privatization. The 1996 budget envisages for a higher current surplus in relation to GDP and the avoidance of domestic bank financing of the overall deficit. New revenue measures are being introduced and the growth of the civil service wage and salary bill is being held to less than the rate of inflation. The 1996 financial program provides for strict limits on loans to public enterprises while allowing increased credit to facilitate private sector activity. The rehabilitation of the financial system is being accelerated with priority attached to the restructuring and recapitalization of banks. The external position remains fragile but Mongolia should be able to finance necessary import growth and gradually build up official reserves, with the present market-determined exchange rate policy and continued strong donor support. The authorities intend to accept Article VIII obligations very soon. On the basis of the policies that are being implemented, economic prospects for 1996 and beyond remain encouraging. Since the program is back on track, the staff recommends the requested waivers of performance criteria for end-March 1995 be granted and the midterm review of the second annual ESAF arrangement be completed.

Introduction Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation and completion of the midterm review of the second annual arrangement under the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) were held in Ulaanbaatar during December l- 13, 1995.’ Mongolia is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The authorities are expected to notify the Fund very soon that they accept the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The Executive Board approved a three-year ESAF arrangement for the equivalent of SDR 40.8 million (110 percent of quota) on June 25, 1993, including the first annual arrangement (July 1, 1993-June 30, 1994) in an amount of SDR 18.6 million (50 percent of quota) that was fully disbursed. The Board concluded the 1994 Article IV consultation on November 23, 1994 and approved the second annual arrangement (October 1, 1994- September 30, 1995) in an amount of SDR 11.1 million (30 percent of quota). Completion of the midterm review of the second annual arrangement, scheduled for June 30, 1995, was delayed because end-March 1995 performance criteria were not met. Measures were taken from midyear to bring the program back on track and the Board on November 20, 1995 extended the commitment period of the second annual arrangement to March 3 1, 1996. In the attached letter to the Managing Director dated January 19, 1996, the authorities request waivers for the nonobservance of March performance criteria on net domestic assets of the banking system, net credit to Government, and net official international reserves (owing to the external contingency mechanism). The justification for granting waivers is that the program has been brought back on track and policy understandings have been reached to maintain progress in 1996. In concluding the last consultation, Directors commended the authorities for progress in reducing macroeconomic imbalances, accelerating the transition to a market economy and meeting the objectives of the first-year ESQ-supported program. To restore financial stability and achieve sustainable growth, they stressed the need to strengthen the budgetary position through revenue mobilization and cuts in current expenditure; adhere to the monetary program to achieve the inflation goals; and press ahead with structural change. Mongolia’s statistical base continues to improve, with Fund technical assistance. IFS and GFS Yearbook country pages were introduced in 1994; core data are provided to the ‘The staff team comprised Messrs. Browne (Head), Morsink, Sidgwick (all SEA), Nishizawa (PDR), Rado (FAD), and Mrs. Santayana (Staff Assistant, SEA). Messrs. Shah (Resident Representative), Kumar (Asian Development Bank), and Petrie (Advisor to the Executive Director) participated in the meetings. Staff teams on May and September visits for the midterm review comprised Messrs. Browne (Head), Morsink, and Panth, and Ms. Duprat (all SEA), and Mr. Nishizawa (PDR). The Mongolian side was led by Finance Minister Byambajav and Governor Molomzhamts and the teams met with Prime Minister Jasrai.

Areas that still require strengthening include coverage of the private sector in the national accounts and reporting on public investment, public enterprise finances, and the balance of payments. There are also weaknesses in the consumer price index and external debt statistics. II. Economic Setting and Performance Under ESAF Arrangement A. Background Mongolia started the transformation process in 1990. Initial emphasis was placed on reducing the role of the public sector; promoting private activities through changes in the legal and institutional framework; creating a two-tier banking system; and expanding and diversifying trading relations. These goals were pursued against the background of severe external shocks--exacerbated by Mongolia’s low per capita income, harsh natural environment, and isolated geographical location--including the virtual cessation of financial assistance from Russia which had been equivalent to 30 percent of GDP, and the collapse of historical trading patterns. Comprehensive price and trade liberalizations were completed during 1990-94 and a market-determined exchange rate system became effective. As a result of the strong reform efforts, the cumulative loss of output was limited to about 20 percent, which was less than in most transition economies, and positive real growth was restored from 1994. Despite a decline in budgetary revenue from 50 percent to 30 percent of GDP, domestic bank financing of the budget was avoided. Almost one half of state-owned assets were privatized--by the distribution of vouchers to all citizens--including livestock herds, agricultural cooperatives, and small businesses, especially shops and restaurants. Substantial donor assistance was mobilized, focused on strengthening public infrastructure in the energy, transportation, and communication sectors. The annual rate of inflation, which had peaked at 420 percent, was reduced to 66 percent in 1994. B. Developments in 1995 Figure 1: Red GDP Gro41, WJO-95 Real GDP growth is estimated at 6 percent in 1995, compared with 2 percent in 1994, and well above initial expectations; private sector activities continued to expand in livestock, mining, construction, and trading. The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) was held to 7 percent of GDP, much less than programmed. Copper exports, boosted by rising international 6 4 prices, were well above target, and noncopper exports were greater than in 1994, mostly owing to increased volumes of gold and processed cashmere. This more than offset the effect Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3- of buoyant imports because of the higher growth rate, the rebuilding of petroleum stocks, and larger purchases of capital equipment. Figure 2: Ertemal Current Account Balance and Reserves, 1990-95 international reserves reached $50 million (six n 6 weeks of imports) at end-December, above the I t 5 . program target.

Toward the end of the year--with a view to minimizing the spreads between the official central bank, interbank, and street market rates--the authorities strengthened their monitoring of market developments and encouraged commercial banks to open additional foreign exchange bureaus. With strong aid disbursements, the capital account was in surplus and net official The current budget surplus was 4 percent of GDP in 1995, in line with the Figure 4: Current Budget Balance, 1990-95 program target. Current revenue was 3 1 percent of GDP, much higher than programmed, with the increased profitability of the Erdenet copper concern reflected in larger income tax and dividend payments. Current expenditure of 27 percent of GDP was also higher than programmed, mainly because of additional civil service wage increases granted after the teachers’ strike. The overall budget Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- deficit was held to 11 percent of GDP in 1995, far below that in 1994 and less than programmed. While the investment program expanded, there were large repayments of loans by public enterprises. The Government increased its deposits with the banking system, in contrast to net borrowing in 1994. While fiscal performance in early 1995 was disappointing, (contributing to the failure to meet end-March performance criteria and Figure 5: Overall Budget Balance and Domestic Bank Financing, 1990-95 10 5 Dmdcbmk&llaing 6 0 3 2 -5 z -10 k -IS 5 -20 -25 -- I!?90 1991 1992 1993 . 1994 . 1995 .I end-June benchmarks for net credit to Government), measures taken in midyear effectively strengthened public finances and the end-December benchmark was met. Actions included the collection of tax arrears from public enterprises and the private sector, cuts in purchases of goods and services, rises of 60 percent in urban bus fares to eliminate subsidies, and increases in bread and flour prices to permit the flour mills to repay outstanding budgetary loans. Measures to improve public enterprise finances were taken as part of the second- year ESAP-supported program. Petroleum prices were raised by 25 percent and electricity prices by 60 percent in late 1994; schedules were established for the repayment by flour mills of all budgetary loans; and cash privatization was initiated. These actions had been expected to enable public enterprises to make a larger net contribution to the budget and reduce their need for bank credit. More fundamental reforms were also envisaged to improve their efficiency. While the cash privatization target (0.5 percent of GDP) was exceeded--assisted by the sale of 49 percent of the telecommunications corporation to a foreign enterprise--other reform initiatives were delayed and overall enterprise profitability did not improve. Credit growth was substantially higher than programmed during the first three quarters of 1995 but was brought back in line with the program later in the year. One major factor was the failure of commercial banks to observe monthly lending ceilings imposed by the Bank of Mongolia, which was ruled as unenforceable by a lower court. In addition, new lending was higher than expected to the state-owned petroleum corporation and energy concerns, and there were shortfalls in repayments of Figure 6: Money and Credit Growth, 1990-95 2 5 200 5 3 3 150 I $ loo B 4 so B 0 earlier loans. Pending appeal of the lower court judgment, the Bank of Mongolia reached bilateral agreements in September with each bank regarding the observance of credit ceilings and including penalties for noncompliance, which helped to reduce lending and achieve the end-December benchmark for net domestic assets of the banking system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- The central bank introduced a regular refinancing facility in March 1995 and restricted access to the clearing and settlement window, which had been an easy source of liquidity for banks. The process of identifying and classifying nonperforming loans of the banking system--estimated at one quarter of their consolidated portfolio--was completed with Fund and other technical assistance, although this procedure proved much more arduous than originally expected. Laws were passed to allow the issuance of promissory notes and bills of exchange, and to permit the opening of checking accounts by individuals. Secondary market trading commenced at the Mongolia Stock Exchange in August 1995 in the shares of 450 listed companies, including those privatized through the voucher and cash programs, although the volume of transactions has been relatively small. The monthly rate of inflation averaged 4 percent in the first three quarters of 1995, but Figure 7: Consumer Price Inflation, 1992-95 with the tightening of financial policies, slowed to 2 percent monthly in November-December; $ 400 however, the rate of inflation was 53 percent in i the year to December 1995, above the program 1 target. The scope for achieving further reductions in inflation was made more difficult = 100 by the increases in civil service wage rates; j!! - limited steps to reduce the size of public OL 1992 1993 1994 199s employment; and lack of progress in addressing public enterprise and financial system reforms. IIL Report on the Discussions Discussions focused on the importance of sustaining prudent financial policies and reinvigorating structural change, especially during the run up to the June 1996 parliamentary election. In particular, the 1996 budget and monetary program needed to be consistent with inflation objectives and public enterprise and financial system reforms needed to be pursued vigorously. While a third-year ESQ-supported program was not discussed explicitly, groundwork was laid for the negotiations that would commence in March. A. Macroeconomic Objectives and Prospects The authorities were confident of achieving real GDP growth of 5 percent in 1996 and the staff agreed with this assessment. The performance of the livestock sector continued to be encouraging in response to market-related incentives; herds were growing, the management of animals had improved, and access to urban markets from rural areas was much easier. The mining sector was developing, with the opening of Mongolian-owned gold mines and greater foreign-financed exploration and drilling for petroleum. Private bus, taxi, hotel, and retail businesses were flourishing in the national capital. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- The authorities considered that inflation could be halved to 25-30 percent in the year to December 1996. The objective would be to contain monthly inflation at 2-3 percent in the first half year and l-2 percent for the second half, so that single-digit annual inflation could be reached in 1997. The staff stressed the desirability of a more ambitious target, particularly in view of the positive supply response to lower inflation that had been evident during the past few years. The authorities stated that the feasibility of this would be kept under review and discussed in the context of the third annual ESAF arrangement. The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected to widen to 10 percent of GDP in 1996. Assisted by further rises in gold output, exports should exceed earlier estimates, despite lower world copper prices. Imports would be slightly above previous projections because of higher economic growth and increased investment. Net official international reserves are projected at $60 million in December, more than initially programmed. The authorities underscored their desire to build up reserves beyond that level, especially if strong donor support continues. B. Public Finance The 1996 budget, which was approved by Parliament in December 1995, provides for a current surplus of 5 percent of GDP, in line with program objectives. The overall budget deficit is to be contained at 11 percent of GDP, below earlier expectations, and bank financing of the deficit will be avoided. Measures have been initiated to meet the current revenue target of 30 percent of GDP, taking account of the expected decline in profitability from the main copper producer. Customs duty exemptions from the standard rate of 15 percent are being withdrawn for some items of capital equipment, raw materials, components, and spare parts; the list of changes will be implemented by decree (to yield 0.4 percent of GDP). The coverage of the sales tax is being broadened to include all major enterprises, as well as trade and services (to yield 0.4 percent of GDP). Investment incentives, especially tax holidays, are being applied more selectively (to yield 0.2 percent of GDP). Fund recommendations to unify the tax administration are under implementation. Mechanisms are being adopted to ensure that adjustments in pensions and other benefits are matched promptly by higher social security contribution rates and that collection procedures are tightened. The authorities stated that current expenditure would be reduced to 25 percent of GDP. The wage and salary bill is to be held below the rate of inflation and no general nominal wage increase would be granted. Steps are being taken to reduce the workforce by 8 percent, through streamlining operations, amalgamating ministries, and rationalizing education and health administration, in accordance with the civil service reform program, prepared with World Bank and UNDP assistance. The authorities agreed that the precise timing of both this year’s and the medium-term retrenchments of civil servants would be determined in the context of the third annual ESAF arrangement. They confirmed that public expenditure management and the Treasury function in the Ministry of Finance would be strengthened this year, especially through the adoption of Fund technical assistance recommendations. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- The authorities have initiated a broad review of the issue of intergovernmental relations, including the clear delineation of areas of responsibility and finances for local governments. No nominal increase in transfers to local authorities was budgeted this year; measures have been introduced to increase their taxation capacity, including greater powers to collect property taxes and user fees. The remaining subsidies to public enterprises, which were provided for rural electricity, have been withdrawn. The national government has made proposals, which are under discussion, for simplifying local government organization and reducing selectively their services. The staff stressed the need to move ahead firmly with these actions, possibly with Fund technical assistance, not only to improve efficiency, but also to prevent the emergence of intra-public sector arrears. Additional spending is being provided for the social safety net and public investment. The poverty alleviation program, prepared with donor support, is targeted at the most vulnerable groups with priority to single-parent families; herders with few animals; and retired, disabled, and unemployed persons. Retrenchment benefits and retraining are being provided for displaced civil servants. The enlarged investment program, which is fully in line with available domestic and external resources, includes rehabilitation for the coal and electricity sectors; road, railway and airport improvements; and telephone modemization. C. Public Enterprise Reform The public enterprise reform program for 1996 entails discrete price adjustments; quarterly implementation of the automatic adjustment price mechanism for changes in import and input costs; the avoidance of further subsidies; strict limits on the provision of new credit, including the absence of central bank loans, and the repayment of outstanding bank and budgetary loans; strengthened efforts to collect overdue customer accounts; accelerated cash privatization, including the sale of shares in large profitable enterprises; the restructuring or closure of unviable concerns; and improved corporate governance. Within this framework, the staff underscored that early actions were crucial to bring down inflation and revitalize structural change, and should be taken prior to a third annual ESAF arrangement. The staff proposed phased electricity price increases of 50 percent during 1996 (to raise revenue of 1 percent of GDP) to cover operating costs and help meet investment needs, with a sizable increase early in the year to enhance the credibility of program commitments. While accepting the need for more substantive price adjustments to improve profitability and increase budgetary revenue, the authorities believed that a gradual approach in tandem with measures to reduce costs and promote efficiency would limit the likelihood of flow-through to prices in other sectors. The authorities highlighted the likely adverse public reaction during the winter season but had raised electricity charges for nonmetered households and small businesses in December 1995 (yielding 0.2 percent of GDP). They indicated that phased increases for all other consumers totaling 15 percent would be introduced this year. A firm decision had been taken to corporatize the Central Energy System in 1996. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- The staff also proposed petroleum product price increases of 25 percent in 1996 (to raise revenue of 1 percent of GDP). While retail prices appeared to be broadly in line with the world market, the petroleum concern continued to borrow heavily from the banking system and delays in its loan repayments were frequent, with consequences for the availability of private sector credit. Moreover, in the statI’s view, the sector should contribute more to budgetary revenue through higher taxes and dividend payments. The authorities pointed out that private imports and distribution of petroleum, which had been permitted since 1994, were adding to competition and reiterated their intention to sell additional shares in the petroleum concern, which is 80 percent state owned. The authorities stated that cash privatization would yield 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, about three times the amount programmed in 1995. A fbll list of enterprises to be sold would be made available shortly, including flour mills, coal and gold mines, and the Gobi cashmere factory. Taking into account the staff’s views, the Government would reduce its shareholding in most of these concerns to below 50 percent. The foreign investment code is being clarified to confirm that majority foreign interests in these enterprises is permitted. Forthcoming passage of land and property rights legislation would also facilitate this process. The Government would ultimately retain ownership in no more than 20 entities, primarily public utilities, rail and air transportation, communication, and research entities. D. Monetary Program and Financial System Reform The financial program for 1996 is directed toward reducing inflation and strengthening the external position. Quarterly benchmarks have been agreed for net official international reserves, net credit to Government, and net domestic assets of the banking system. While the income velocity of broad money rose during 1995, the renewed commitment to reduce inflation is projected to result in stable velocity. Greater allowance has been made for seasonal factors than in the past, including the recognition of low government revenue collection in the first half year. With less inflation and increased confidence in the domestic currency, the amount of foreign currency deposits is expected to remain about constant, so that its share in broad money (the dollarization ratio) would decline further. The net domestic assets of the banking system are projected to grow less quickly than broad money, in order to offset the relatively faster growth of net foreign assets. Net credit to Government is expected to fall, owing to the excess of foreign financing over the budget deficit. Credit to public enterprises is programmed to decline substantially in real terms, reflecting improvement in their financial positions. Credit to the private sector is forecast to grow more than broad money to support growth. Monthly credit ceilings are being retained until banks establish a track record of sound practices and a more reliable mechanism exists for open-market operations. The Bank of Mongolia has concluded bilateral agreements with banks for the first quarter of 1996 that include the observance of minimum reserve requirements, loan-to-deposit ratios, and other prudential ratios. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- The authorities plan to extend gradually the use of indirect monetary instruments in 1996. The framework for policy will include increased reliance on the reserve money program; a regular auction of central bank bills at market-related interest rates, so that they play a larger role in liquidity management, and set the ground for the introduction of open market operations in due course; and strict implementation of the regulations on the use of the central bank financing facilities, including the elimination of concessional loans to specific sectors. The Bank of Mongolia is considering the extension of reserve requirements to foreign currency deposits, as recommended by the Fund, which would help to avoid the potential for sudden increases in the dollarization of the economy. The maintenance of positive real interest rates remains a key policy objective to promote the efficient use of bank credit and mobilize financial resources. The Bank of Mongolia has submitted legislative amendments to impose limits on lending by banks to single borrowers, restrict insider loans, and require banks to make provisions for nonperforming loans. The staff stated it was imperative that the revised Banking Act ensures that the central bank is accorded full power to enact monetary as well as prudential policy. While supporting the central bank’s action to make specific agreements with individual banks on credit ceilings to avoid further litigation, it was stressed that this could only be a temporary measure. The staff noted that the Bank of Mongolia continues to move ahead with measures to improve its bank supervisory activities and underlined the need for further progress in this area. The staff expressed concern about the slow pace of rehabilitation of the banking system. The authorities responded that their inspection of individual banks had recently been completed, and banks which were most viable had been identified; there was a possibility of mergers and liquidation for certain banks. They were now drawing up action plans for the recapitaliiation and restructuring of all potentially viable banks, and the issuance of government bonds in exchange for nonperforming loans, including a detailed implementation timetable, in line with the Fund, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank recommenda- tions. However, the asset substitution would be undertaken only on a selective basis for viable banks with a good restructuring record. This process should be completed in 1996 and provision would be made in the 1997 budget for initial interest payments on the bonds. E. External Sector Issues Offkial grants and concessional loan disbursements are expected to be larger in 1996, because of higher commitments made at the last Mongolia Assistance Group meeting in November 1994 and improvements in absorptive capacity. However, higher import growth associated with stronger economic activity will require continued donor assistance to avoid the emergence of an external financing gap. It was agreed to keep zero limits on nonconcessional borrowing, in accordance with the definition under the second annual ESAF arrangement. External borrowing limits for a third annual ESAF arrangement would be set in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Executive Board on October 25, 1995.

While this system led to an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate index in the 18 months to end- 1994, the subsequent depreciation of the tugrik against the U.S. dollar partially reversed the previous trend. The authorities confirmed that movements in the exchange rate reflecting market forces would not be resisted and that intervention would be limited to smoothing operations. In order to eliminate the multiple currency practice arising from the lag in announcing the official rate, daily announcement of the central bank rate commenced in January 1996, based on the average of commercial banks’ rates. The only remaining exchange restriction arises from the outstanding payments to Finland ($1.4 million), which the authorities said would be cleared by end-January 1996. With regard to inoperative bilateral payments arrangements, agreement was reached with China in December 1994 to settle the small outstanding balance in 1996; channels do not exist to settle the outstanding balances with the Islamic State of Afghanistan; and on November 4, 1994, Mongolia notified the Fund under Decision 144-(52/5 1) of restrictions vis-&is the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SerbiaMontenegro). With regard to remaining trade restrictions, the staffurged the abolition as soon as possible of the ban on raw cashmere exports, presently scheduled for October 1, 1996. Negotiations are continuing on disputes concerning debt to former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) countries owed under inoperative IBEC clearing arrangements and long-term transferable ruble debt. Agreement was reached with Germany in July 1995 on a repayment schedule to settle all outstanding debt (valued at DM 14.2 million) on concessional terms by the year 2004. Progress was made in the latest rounds of negotiations with both Russia and the Czech Republic in November 1995 and discussions will continue in 1996, while negotiations with Poland are expected to take place soon. Capital movements into and out of Mongolia are governed by a liberal regulatory framework. The only differential monetary regulations are the exemption of foreign currency deposits from reserve requirements, which is now under review by the Bank of Mongolia, and the minimum deposit rate, which is a transitory measure to ensure positive real deposit rates and encourage savings in a financial system. For prudential reasons, a commercial bank’s open foreign currency position may not exceed 20 percent of capital on an aggregate basis, or 10 percent of capital for any individual currency. While the purchase of central bank bills is currently limited to licensed commercial banks, the securities legislation does not restrict the operations of nonresidents on local stock exchange, money, or credit markets. IV. Medium-Term Outlook and Capacity to Repay the Fund The authorities reiterated their commitment to the ESAF-supported program and stated that the policy understandings for 1996 outlined in the previous paragraphs should continue the reform momentum and permit the consolidation of earlier gains. Provided that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- persistence is shown in maintaining tight financial policies, especially in the pre-election period, and implementing structural measures, they believed that a favorable environment should be created for private savings and investment. The authorities agreed that formidable challenges still remain to be overcome on the path to a market economy. Mongolia’s lack of infrastructure, geographical isolation, and acute shortage of entrepreneurial skills limited the prospects for rapid productivity and income growth. Nevertheless, with appropriate policies, they considered that real GDP growth of about 5 percent annually would appear to be sustainable over the medium term. This would require the expansion and diversification of export-oriented production, mainly through exploitation of mineral resources and agro-based processing. Foreign direct investment would be promoted to provide financial and technological help. Even if all goes well, the external current account deficit is projected to decline only moderately over the medium term and balance of payments viability will not be achieved quickly.* Export diversification is likely to be a lengthy process and the scope for efficient import substitution is limited. With the enormous infrastructure needs, especially if the natural resource base is to be developed, it will be vital to retain the strong support of the international community. A sizable undisbursed aid pipeline has been built up and further aid group meetings are planned, which are expected to secure additional commitments for 1996-98. External debt service in convertible currencies is projected to decline in this period, as outstanding commercial debts are repaid. Mongolia’s capacity to repay the Fund continues to depend on the sustained implementation of stabilization and structural measures, as well as continued donor support. Risks are associated with possible declines in international copper prices, the low international reserves, the settlement terms of long-term transferable ruble debt, and uncertain regional economic prospects. However, including prospective loan disbursements under the ESAF arrangement, repayments to the Fund will not exceed 2 percent of exports of goods and services. Mongolia’s record in making payments to the Fund has been good and the authorities are expected to discharge their payments to the Fund on a timely basis. V. Staff Appraisal Mongolia made considerable progress in the transition to a market economy during 1990-94 and the output loss was limited to less than in many transition economies. In the first half of 1995, there were slippages in financial policies, a teachers’ strike was settled only through costly wage increases, and public sector reform slowed. However, corrective measures taken in midyear enabled the fiscal and monetary benchmarks for end-December to *Balance of payments projections for 1999-2006 have not been revised from those shown in EBS/93/79, although in view of the revised outlook for 1996-98, the current account deficits are expected to be smaller as a percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- be met, For the year, real GDP growth was stronger and the external position improved, benefitting from higher copper prices, although the rate of inflation was higher than projected. The reform process in Mongolia has now reached a critical juncture and, with regard to macrostability, a major question is the sustainability of prudent financial policies prior to the June 1996 parliamentary election. The staff would stress the need to press ahead with efforts to consolidate the substantial earlier gains and revitalize structural reform, especially to strengthen public enterprise finances and improve the soundness of the banking system. Decisive action in these areas would help to ensure continued strong donor support. The projected inflation rate for 1996, while substantially less than the increase recorded in 1995, falls short of the objective specified in the initial ESAF arrangement. The staff would underscore the desirability of a more ambitious target and pursue this in the context of a third annual program. Every effort should be made to reduce the annual inflation rate to single digits by 1997, thereby returning to the original program path. The 1996 budget is in line with program objectives, including a higher current surplus in relation to GDP, and the avoidance of domestic bank financing of the overall deficit. However, the required revenue measures--partly to offset the expected decline in receipts from the main copper producer--have not yet been fully introduced. The staffwould urge the authorities to move rapidly to eliminate income tax and customs duty exemptions, extend the sales tax to private enterprises, and strengthen tax administration. The authorities also need to carefully monitor the performance of the social security system, especially the achievement of higher contribution goals. A difficult area for fiscal policy, especially in the pre-election setting, will be the control of current expenditure. The staff welcomes the commitment to avoid any general nominal wage increase for civil servants in 1996, and limit the growth of the wage bill to less than the rate of inflation, in contrast to the experience in 1995. The staff urges the authorities to set up firm plans to cut civil service employment, especially in education and health administration, in the context of a third annual E&IF-supported program. More work also needs to be done to establish clear priorities for all spending categories and to improve public expenditure management. If revenue shortfalls or expenditure excesses appear, prompt corrective action will be needed to safeguard program objectives. Public enterprise reform, including energy price adjustments and accelerated cash privatization, is crucial to achieve budgetary and credit objectives and bring down the rate of inflation. Energy price adjustments are needed to generate greater budgetary revenue and reduce the demand for bank credit by the state-owned electricity and petroleum concerns. The cash privatization program should include large profitable enterprises and concrete steps are required to restructure, merge, or liquidate unviable concerns. The staffwould emphasize that early significant action will be needed as a basis for successful implementation of a third annual ESAF-supported program. While compensating measures provide confidence that the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - fiscal and monetary targets for 1996 can be met, fundamental changes in the public enterprise sector are needed to promote medium-term sustainable growth. The financial program for 1996 provides for increased credit to facilitate private sector activity and strict limits on loans to public enterprises. Credit ceilings will need to be retained --on a legal basis, with penalties for noncompliance--until banks have established a better track record of sound lending practices, including prudent loan-to-deposit limits, and a more reliable mechanism for open market operations is in place. The staff would urge the authorities to accelerate the rehabilitation of the banking system, with priority attached to the development of recapitalization plans for each potentially viable commercial bank. The external position remains fragile, with an export sector that is dependent on copper, the need for substantial energy and capital goods imports, modest holdings of international reserves, and the open issue of the settlement of long-term transferable ruble debt. In these circumstances, it is necessary to further strengthen aid absorption capacity; follow prudent debt management policies, including the avoidance of external commercial borrowing, except for normal short-term import-related credits; preserve an open-trading system, including the early abolition of the ban on raw cashmere exports; and maintain overall competitiveness. The exchange rate is market determined and the staff sees its present level as broadly appropriate, but would stress the importance of continuing to allow movements in the exchange rate that reflect market forces and taking additional steps to narrow the spread between the central bank, interbank, and street market exchange rates. The staffwelcomes the authorities’ intention to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3, and 4 shortly. The staff notes that Mongolia maintains a relatively liberal capital account regime. Mongolia provides core statistical data to the Fund on a timely basis. On the basis of the financial and structural policies that are being implemented, economic prospects for 1996 and the medium term continue to be encouraging and remain broadly unchanged from that envisaged at the beginning of the ESAF arrangement. Mongolia’s capacity to repay the Fund remains satisfactory. Since the program has been brought back on track and the authorities have taken steps to deal with the underlying problems, the stat?+ recommends that the requested waivers of performance criteria be granted and that the midterm review be completed. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Mongolia be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- VI. Proposed Decision The following draft decision is proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: 1.

Dear Mr. Camdessus: 1. On June 25, 1993, the Fund’s Executive Board approved a three-year arrangement under the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) for Mongolia, together with the first annual arrangement thereunder. The second annual arrangement was approved by the Executive Board on November 23, 1994 and, at that time, the midterm review was expected to be completed by June 30, 1995. However, the March 1995 performance criteria were not all met and the midterm review was not completed as originally scheduled. 2. The Government took measures in midyear designed to bring the program back on track during the fourth quarter of 1995, including intensified efforts to collect tax arrears, reduced government purchases of goods and services, an accelerated cash privatization program, and the formalization of understandings between the Bank of Mongolia and each commercial bank regarding the observance of monthly credit ceilings and minimum reserve requirements. In order to allow time for the measures to become fully effective and thereby help to establish a suitable basis for the third annual arrangement, at our request, the Executive Board on November 20, 1995 approved an extension of the second annual arrangement period. 3. The Government has now taken action to meet the earlier agreed conditions attached to completing the midterm review including observance of the monthly targets for budget revenue and expenditure, net official international reserves, net credit to Government, and net domestic assets of the banking system for October-December 1995; and the development of a financial and structural program for 1996, consistent with existing commitments. In the following paragraphs, economic developments in 1995 are reviewed and economic policies for 1996 are elaborated, In view of the success in bringing the program back on track, the Government requests waivers for the nonobservance of the March 1995 performance criteria on net domestic assets of the banking system, net credit to Government, and net official international reserves (owing to the operation of the external contingency mechanism).

Real GDP growth of 6 percent in 1995 was in excess of expectations, spurred by the expansion of activity in the livestock industry, construction, and trading sectors. Developments in the external sector were satisfactory. The external current account (excluding official transfers) registered a deficit of 7 percent of GDP, well below target owing to higher copper export prices and service receipts; aid disbursements were strong, especially for infrastructure; and net official international reserves were built up by more than programmed. However, principally because of financial slippages in the first half of the year, inflation did not fall as much or as rapidly as anticipated. The average rate of price increase was 57 percent in 1995, partly because of changes in administered prices. 5. A basic objective of fiscal policy in 1995 was to raise the current surplus by 1 percent of GDP, thereby providing sufficient local counterpart funds for public investment projects, and this target was achieved. The revenue target was exceeded, owing to the intensified collection of income taxes, customs duties, and privatization receipts; a higher contribution from the Erdenet copper concern; and revenue from the sale of shares in the telecommunica- tions corporation of Mongolia to a foreign concern. The expenditure target was met because actions taken in the second half of the year to cut purchases of goods and services and increase bread and flour prices and bus fares more than offset the higher wage, salary, and pension bills. The overall budget deficit target was met, notwithstanding the allocation of additional domestic resources for investment. 6. In October 1994, the Government adopted a resolution identifying more than 400 public enterprises to be sold on a cash basis or liquidated and in August 1995, secondary market trading of shares in the Mongolian Stock Exchange began. As agreed, almost Tug 3 billion in cash privatization proceeds was received by the budget in 1995. Budgetary loans to the flour mills extended in March 1994 were fully repaid in December 1995. 7. In the fourth quarter of 1995, adjustments were made to increase electricity prices for nonmetered households and small business users by 19-300 percent. As a result of this price adjustment, the annual revenue of the Central Energy System will be increased by Tug 300 million, comprising Tug 100 million from households and Tug 200 million from small business users. 8. Higher-than-programmed monetary growth up until September was due to commercial banks’ claims on nonbanks (especially public enterprises) exceeding the monthly credit ceilings set by the Bank of Mongolia; commercial banks violating the minimum reserve requirements imposed by the Bank of Mongolia; and shortfalls in scheduled repayments of outstanding loans by the private sector and the state-owned petroleum corporation, flour mills, and energy concerns. In September, legally binding agreements were reached with each commercial bank regarding the observance of credit ceilings and penalties imposed on amounts in excess or under the stipulated level. During the fourth quarter, credit to nonbanks fell to within targeted Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - ANNEX1 levels, and minimum reserve requirements were met. The original end-December targets on net domestic assets of the banking system and net credit to Government were observed. 9. The external trade deficit was lower than originally projected. Both exports and imports were in excess of projections. Copper export prices were much higher than projected, while export volume was close to full capacity. Assisted by higher disbursements of official grants and loans, the overall balance of payments improved and net official international reserves exceeded the end-December benchmark. 10. Over the year, the exchange rate of tugrik against the U.S. dollar depreciated by about 15 percent. The spreads between the official central bank rate, the interbank rate, and the street market rate were gradually reduced. As stipulated in the ESAF agreement, no nonconcessional loans have been contracted or guaranteed by the public sector during the period of the second annual arrangement. Outstanding external debt in convertible currencies at end-December 1995 was within the program target. II. Economic Program for 1996 11. The 1996 program provides for real GDP growth of 5 percent, as a minimum, led by continued expansion in livestock, mining, and export-oriented production. The average inflation rate is projected to fall to 30-35 percent in 1996. In order to build on the achievements so far in creating a more efficient economy and fostering conditions favorable to private investment, the emphasis in 1996 will be put on reinvigorating the structural reforms by removing the remaining price distortions, tirther reducing the size of the public sector, accelerating cash privatization, strengthening the legal and institutional framework, and developing the social safety net. 12. The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected at 10 percent of GDP, slightly higher than in the original program. A gradual decline in world copper prices is projected. Higher import values reflect larger economic growth and improvements in aid absorption capacity. We are seeking additional commitments at the February 1996 donor meeting. Fiscal policy 13. In accordance with existing commitments, the 1996 budget provides for a rise in the current surplus and a slight decline in net credit to government. On the revenue side, taking into account the expected decline in relation to GDP of receipts from the Erdenet concern because of lower copper prices, new measures have been introduced to yield at least 1 percent of GDP. The fiscal policy actions include provisions to reduce customs duty exemptions; extend the domestic sales tax; and provide for more selective applications of investment incentives. Fund technical assistance recommendations to strengthen tax and customs administration will be introduced during the year. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - ANNEX1 14. The 1996 budget includes provisions designed to reduce current expenditure in relation to GDP, while at the same time allowing additional expenditure in priority areas. In line with that strategy, the growth of the civil service wage bill will be held below the rate of inflation. There will be no general nominal wage increase for civil servants this year. Measures are being introduced to streamline the central and local government administrations and the provision of education and health services, in line with the management development program agreed with international organizations. The timing of a sizable retrenchment of civil service will be determined in the context of the third annual ESAP arrangement. This will reduce expenditure and the number of civil servants and make the government structure more consistent with the needs of a market economy. In addition, virtually no increases will be made in transfers to local authorities and subsidies to public enterprises will be eliminated. 15. Taking into account the likely availability of domestic and external resources, the public investment program is projected to rise substantially. In line with World Bank recommendations, spending will be concentrated in the energy, transportation, and communication sectors. The provision of additional local counterpart funds will be assured for the public investment program. Additional expenditure will be targeted to the poverty alleviation program, which has recently been initiated with the assistance of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the United Nations Development Program. This includes retrenchment benefits, retraining costs, and other social expenditures. 16. As part of the financial system reform supported by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, we intend to issue in 1996 government bonds and securities to replace the inherited and directed nonperforming loans of banks. The bonds will involve some interest costs, probably beginning in 1997. Public enterprise reform 17. Efforts will be stepped up to improve the financial positions of the public enterprises so that revenues cover both operational costs and capital expenditure and obviate the need for budgetary support. In particular, timely and appropriate price adjustments will be made with regard to energy and petroleum supplies. As a minimum, the revenue of the Central Energy System will be increased by Tug 2-3 billion and the revenue of the petroleum corporation by Tug l-2 billion in 1996, with the initial increase in electricity prices already implemented for nonmetered households and small business users. The automatic adjustment of prices to changes in import and input prices of energy products will be effective this year. With a view to accurately monitor the financial performance of public enterprises, their accounting methods will be brought up to international standards. 18. The Government will continue to pursue policies to promote greater private sector activity. We remain convinced that most public enterprises must be privatized in order to correct their long-standing structural problems and ensure their long-term viability and dynamic growth. Building on the success of cash privatization in 1995, we intend, over the next year, to accelerate the cash privatization of large profitable public enterprises, including Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - ANNEX1 flour mills, coal and gold mines, the Gobi cashmere factory, and the petroleum import concern. Further, it is the intention of the Government to retain full ownership in no more than 20 large entities, including public utilities, rail and air transportations, communications, and research entities. The foreign investment code is being simplified and clarified to permit majority foreign interests in these enterprises. Passage of land and property rights legislation will also facilitate this process. All privatization receipts, estimated at 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, will be earmarked for the budget and treated as financing for the investment program. Monetary policy 19. Monetary policy is directed primarily toward substantially reducing inflation and strengthening the external position, so as to create a favorable climate for investment and sustainable economic growth. The 1996 financial program has been formulated on the assumptions of an increase in net official international reserves of $10 million, an inflation rate of 25-30 percent at end-year, and unchanged income velocity. The largest share in the growth of credit will be for private sector activity, while lending to public enterprises will be sharply reduced, and net credit to Government will decline. In accordance with this strategy, the quarterly benchmarks for net official international reserves, net credit to Government, and net domestic assets of the banking system are shown in the attached table. 20. Monthly ceilings on commercial bank lending will be retained to ensure compliance with the credit targets and to give commercial banks sufficient time to establish a track record of sound banking practices. The Bank of Mongolia has negotiated legally binding agreements with each commercial bank for the first quarter of 1996, that cover not only the observance of credit ceilings with penalties for noncompliance as in the fourth quarter of 1995, but also the observance of loan-to-deposits limits and other prudential ratios. The repayment schedules for the bank merger loans and the directed agricultural credit from 1994 will be fully enforced, and no new directed credits will be provided. The regulations governing use of the central bank’s credit facilities will be implemented strictly. 21. The use of indirect instruments of monetary policy will be extended gradually. In that connection, the reserve money program will provide the framework of monetary management. To permit central bank bills to play a greater role in short-term liquidity management, the auction interest rate will be adjusted in line with market forces. In order to encourage improved liquidity management by commercial banks, including promoting the interbank money market and the purchase of central bank bills, excess reserves will not be remunerated, while required reserves excluding cash will continue to earn interest in order to lessen the incentive for disintermediation. The central bank is considering the extension of reserve requirements to foreign currency deposits. The maintenance of positive real lending and deposit interest rates remains a key policy objective to promote the efficient use of bank credit and the mobilization of financial resources. Any reductions in the refinance rate, the clearing rate, or the minimum deposit rate will be conditional on a substantial reduction in inflation.

In late 1995, Parliament passed a law regulating the issuance and transfer of promissory notes and bills of exchange. It passed another law on deposits, credits, and settlements to clarifjl the legal basis of the relationship between banks and depositors and borrowers and to allow individuals to open checking accounts. The Bank of Mongolia has also submitted to Parliament amendments to the Banking Act to impose limits on lending by banks to single borrowers, require banks to make provisions for nonperforming loans, restrict loans to directors and shareholders and other related interests, prevent bank shareholders from withdrawing their paid-up capital, and establish a credit information bureau. 23. The Government of Mongolia is committed to pressing ahead as quickly as practicable financial sector reform with technical assistance from the Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. The amounts of nonperforming loans on commercial banks’ balance sheets have been identified. The authorities have inspected individual banks and identified which banks are most viable; there is a possibility of liquidation for certain banks. By March 1996, the government and the commercial banks will draw up individual recapitalization plans for each viable bank, including a detailed implementation timetable. The Bank of Mongolia’s supervisory activities have been strengthened and further improvements will be implemented shortly. Accounting principles based on international standards are being studied and introduced to the Bank of Mongolia and the commercial banks. External policies 24. The policies outlined in the above paragraphs are consistent with higher-than-originally programmed targets for net official international reserves. Given the sensitivity of Mongolia’s external position to changes in world copper prices, the Government of Mongolia will pursue policies that support the expansion and diversification of exports and promote the efficient substitution of imports by domestic production. The Bank of Mongolia began this month to announce the official exchange rate on a daily basis. It will pursue efforts to unify the interbank and street foreign exchange markets; continue to allow exchange rate movements to reflect market forces; refrain from intervening in the foreign exchange market, except for short-term smoothing operations; and ensure that no multiple currency practices emerge. 25. The Government will continue negotiations on transferable ruble debt with former CMEA countries. The Government will continue to avoid external nonconcessional borrowings. We are in the process of making the remaining outstanding external payments to Finland. The ban on raw cashmere exports that was introduced in early 1994 will be removed no later than the scheduled date of October 1, 1996. Licensing regulations on nonferrous and metal scrap exports will be replaced with an export tax, which will not increase the existing anti-export bias; this measure will be gradually phased out and could eventually be replaced by a domestic tax. Mongolia does not maintain exchange restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions and intends to accept now the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3, and 4.

Progress to Date The Mongolian authorities have established a framework for monitoring macroeconomic developments with technical assistance from the Fund and core data are provided on a timely basis. An KS country page was published in December 1994 and a country page was introduced in the 1994 GFSyearbook. The authorities agreed on a timetable for the full implementation of the STA multisector mission recommendations, thus satisfying the structural benchmark for end-March 1995 under the second-year ESAF arrangement. Follow-up missions for price and balance of payments statistics have taken place and a follow-up GFS visit is planned for mid-1996. II. Outstanding Issues The consumer price index is being revised, in line with STA recommendations, to reflect present household expenditure patterns. The coverage of the private sector in the national accounts needs to be broadened and the reporting on public investment, the social safety net, disbursements of foreign aid, and the financial operations of public enterprises strengthened. A 1995 STA mission recommended that data on foreign grants be improved by using data provided by donors and a ratio be introduced to identify the freight and insurance components of merchandise imports valued on a c.i.f. basis. The authorities intend to implement these and other recommendations in the 1995 STA mission report and further improve external debt statistics. In the area of money and banking statistics, the systems that have been developed for compiling monetary statistics will need to be revised following the planned introduction of new charts of accounts for the central bank and the commercial banks. There is als0.a need for institutional improvements in statistics. III. Publications The State Statistical Office publishes timely monthly, quarterly, and annual Statistical Bulletins, in English and Mongolian, which include data on population, employment, national accounts and prices, household income and expenditure, central and local government revenue and expenditure, and external trade. The Bank of Mongolia publishes a monthly Statistical Bulletin, published within 15 days of the end of the month in English and Mongolian which includes summary statistics for the central bank and the consolidated sheet of commercial banks, along with information on interest and exchange rates, and has published Annual Reports since 1993. All publications are available publicly.

The Economic Rehabilitation Credit, which financed imports and raw materials for the transportation, energy, mining, petroleum, and agricultural sectors, was fully disbursed. The component of the Technical Assistance Credit that targets the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Mongolia, financed by Japan and executed by the Fund, was implemented. An Economic Transition Support Credit ($20 million), approved in October 1993 to finance critical imports and technical assistance for the mining and transportation sectors, provided quick-disbursing support to assist policy implementation under the E&IF-supported program. A Transport Rehabilitation Credit ($30 million), approved in May 1994, addressed key constraints in the transportation sector, particularly by arresting the deterioration of the quality and quantity of transport services in railways, urban transportation, trucking, and roads. A Poverty Alleviation for Vulnerable Groups Credit ($10 million), approved in July 1995, aims to promote income generation for the poor, raise basic education enrolment rates, reduce maternal mortality, and assist the disabled, particularly children. Several projects are under preparation, including a Coal Rehabilitation Credit ($35 million) for FY 1996; a Banking and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit ($15 million) and an Urban Services Rehabilitation Credit ($15 million) for FY 1997; and an Energy Sector Rehabilitation Credit ($20 million) and a Human Resources Development Credit ($7 million) for FY 1998. An IDA-financed Financial Sector Technical Assistance project, which is a critical input into the design of the proposed Banking and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit, has been under way in collaboration with the Fund and the Asian Development Bank since October 1994. This project aims to strengthen the supervisory capacity of the Bank of Mongolia and to support improved recovery by commercial banks, portfolio reviews of commercial banks, and on-site bank examinations. The first Country Economic Memorandum was distributed to the Banks Executive Board in December 1991. The second memorandum was completed in October 1994. An Energy Sector Review and a report on Prospects for Wheat Production were completed in FY 1995. Four reports are scheduled for FY 1996: Poverty Assessment, Transport Sector Strategy, Financial Sector Review, and Public Enterprise Review. A third Country Economic Memorandum is scheduled for FY 1997. A report on the Consequences of Large-Scale Privatization, in collaboration with the University of Maryland, is also scheduled for completion in FY 1997. Bank staff participate regularly in ESAF negotiation missions.

The Bank participated, with Fund staff and other donors, in the UNDP-organized meeting on poverty alleviation in Ulaanbaatar in June 1994. After the first IFC mission in 1991, several longer-term investment opportunities were identified. IFC is currently examining investment in the petroleum sector. A FIAS mission visited Mongolia in 1993 and submitted a report to the Government reviewing the Foreign Investment Law and identifying constraints on foreign investment. Mongolia signed the MIGA Convention in June 1991 but has not ratified it yet. MIGA can thus register investment projects, thereby maintaining eligibility for coverage once Mongolia becomes a member, but cannot issue guarantees for investments until all membership requirements are l%lfilled. There are currently no investment projects in Mongolia registered with MlGA. Table 1. World Bank: Loan Approvals and Disbursements to Mongolia, FY 1992-96 l!

The objective of the AsDB’s operational strategy is to facilitate the transition of the economy, with priority attached to: creating an environment in which a competitive and efficient market economy can flourish; developing human resource skills; and strengthening the physical infrastructure. AsDB operations in 1995 and beyond will be guided by these priorities. As of December 3 1, 1995, the AsDB had approved ten loans from the Asian Development Fund totaling $25 1 million, including a quick-disbursing Special Assistance Loan to finance critical imports ($30 million, approved in 1991); a quick-disbursing Industrial Sector Program Loan ($30 million, approved in August 1993); a loan for a feasibility study and detailed design for Ulaanbaatar Airport ($36 million, approved in December 1993); a loan for developing the digital telecommunications network in Ulaanbaatar, Erdenet, and Dar-khan ($25 million, approved in June 1994); a loan for road development ($25 million, approved in September, 1995); and a quick-disbursing Agricultural Sector Program Loan ($35 million, approved in December 1995). In addition, the AsDB had approved technical assistance grants amounting to $25 million. The AsDB expects to approve $55 million in project loans and $6 million in technical assistance in 1996. Essential prerequisites for this are: the Government’s ability to absorb already extended assistance and to implement projects on schedule; the progress of the Government’s reform program; and further progress toward macroeconomic stability. Potential projects to be considered in 1996 include a financial sector intermediation/program loan; an energy conservation project; and an education development project. The AsDB will continue to be actively involved in policy dialogue with the Government with regard to macroeconomic management and structural reforms. Such dialogue, to be facilitated through the provision of AsDB-financed technical assistance and the AsDB’s own economic and sector work, aims at developing a sound policy framework, promoting sector restructuring, strengthening institutions, developing human resources, and improving economic efficiency. Since the Government continues to face fiscal constraints, the AsDB will carefully assess the availability of counterpart funds for its financed projects. AsDB support will continue to be met from the Asian Development Fund, which provides concessional loans carrying an annual service charge of 1 percent with a repayment period of 35-40 years and a grace period of 10 years. Co-financing will be sought with the World Bank, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan, and other aid agencies for projects in areas such as energy, infrastructure, finance, human resource development, and poverty alleviation. The AsDB has participated in four Mongolia Assistance Group meetings and most of the ESAF discussions with the authorities. ‘Prepared by Asian Development Bank staff.
