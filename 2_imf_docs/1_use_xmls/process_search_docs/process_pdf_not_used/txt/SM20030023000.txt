Russell Kincaid July 2,2003 . Discussions for the 2003 Article IV consultation were conducted in San Salvador during May 12-27,2003, by a mission team consisting of E. Offerdal (Head), P. Druck, C. Macario, S. Martin (all WHD), L. Jaramillo (EP, FIN), and P. Rabanal (EP, MFD). . Elections for the National Assembly were held on March 16, with a loss of two seats for the government party (ARENA), and a gain of six seats for the main opposition party (FMLN). The opposition is calling for reversal of key economic reforms, and the pressure for populist measures is likely to increase significantly before the presidential elections in March 2004. l Economic developments have fallen short of expectations after the introduction of official dollarization in January 200 1. Economic growth remains low (about 2 percent annually), and the external environment and trends in domestic demand make a near- term recovery unlikely. Public debt has risen sharply on account of reconstruction expenditures after two earthquakes in 200 1. Private banks are increasingly exposed to regional risk, and some public financial institutions have large nonperforming loan portfolios and weak profitability. l Maintaining the credibility of dollarization will require a strengthening of policies. It will be important to adhere to a strong and early fiscal adjustment as well as boosting the liquid reserves of the central bank to cushion the economy against external shocks and natural disasters. 0 El Salvador subscribes to the SDDS. Economic statistics allow for a close monitoring of economic developments, and few weaknesses remain in the statistical system. The authorities have requested technical assistance from STA to improve their national accounts methodology. 0 El Salvador has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains a system free of restrictions on current international transactions. El Salvador has no outstanding obligations to the Fund.

Since the mid- to late 1990s however, growth has slowed, the fiscal position has deteriorated, and public debt has increased rapidly. The fiscal deficit increased to 4.6 percent of GDP in 2002, largely because of reconstruction expenditures following the 200 1 earthquakes. Hence, public debt increased to reach 40 percent of GDP in 2002. Some reduction in the deficit to 4.1 percent of GDP is projected for 2003, reflecting a large cutback in capital expenditures, partially offset by new stimulus measures announced in April. Weaknesses remain in the financial sector, stemming in part from a rapid expansion of cross-border lending operations and an expansion of financial conglomerates. These activities are not adequately supervised. Also, the financial sector has a considerable exposure to impaired assets (about 12 percent of total assets) with inadequate provisioning, and to public debt (about 20-30 percent of total assets). The slow recovery, fiscal deterioration, and weaknesses in the financial sector could result in a continuing and significant medium-term drag on economic growth. Combined with considerable exposure to external shocks, this might generate increasing confidence problems, in particular with regard to the sustainability of public debt. The authorities are fully aware of these medium-term vulnerabilities A fiscal adjustment of about 3 percentage points of GDP, primarily through increased taxes and strengthened tax enforcement, will be necessary to put public debt on a declining path. However, the political environment makes any substantive fiscal adjustment, in particular tax increases, unlikely in 2003. Financial sector supervision needs to be improved, in part through stronger regional cooperation and information sharing arrangements. Also, a rapid increase in precautionary liquidity buffers, including a limited lender of last resort facility, would help counter potential confidence problems. The credibility of official dollarization would be strengthened by a clarification of the role of the central bank and enhanced transparency of its operations. To this end, it would be important to dispose of the large residual stock of coZ6n notes still in the central bank (about US$745 million, or 5 percent of GDP) and terminate central bank open market operations.

Over the past decade, El Salvador built a good macroeconomic policy track record. After the end of the civil war in 1992, the authorities: a maintained a sound fiscal policy, which helped reduce public debt from about 50 percent of GDP in 1992 to about 30 percent in 2000; a introduced a de-facto peg of the coldn to the U.S. dollar, which helped reduce inflation from an annual average of 15 percent in 1992-93 to 4 percent in 2000; 0 implemented a series of structural reforms. 2. Real GDP recovered rapidly during 1992-95, but growth then slowed to an annual average of 3.1 percent during 1996-2000 (Figure 1). This slowdown was due mainly to high domestic interest rates and stagnating private investment, but also reflected a considerable weakening in export growth in 1998-99 after very high growth in the previous years. Although the peg contributed to a cumulative appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of 47 percent during 1992-2000, a prudent wage policy and some productivity gains reduced unit labor cost in export industries and broadly maintained competitiveness. 3. Social indicators have improved considerably over the past decade as social spending has gradually increased.’ Still, El Salvador ranks low in international comparisons: its rating on the U.N. Human Development Index are comparable to those of Honduras and Nicaragua, and far inferior to that of Costa Rica. Moreover, income distribution is highly uneven, and underemployment is high, especially in rural areas affected by the downturn in the coffee sector. B. Developments and Outlook 2001-03 4. Aiming to boost economic growth, the authorities reinforced their strategy in 2001 with important initiatives. They introduced official dollarization in January 2001 to reduce domestic interest rates, exchange rate risk, and transaction costs and, thus, to reinvigorate private investment and exports. The process of withdrawing colones from circulation has proceeded well-by end-2002 only about 10 percent of the 2000 stock was still in circulation. The government also formulated a medium-term fiscal program that aimed to reduce the overall public sector deficit from 3 percent of GDP in 2000 to 1% percent over the medium term. Structural reforms were to focus on strengthening public banks and financial supervision, expanding the role of the private sector, and making further progress in trade integration. i See Chapter V of the Selected Issues Paper.

This was due, to an important extent, to the impact of several shocks experienced in 2001: two severe earthquakes, declining coffee prices, a drought, and the downturn in the U.S. economy. 6. Dollarization of the economy has generated several favorable results: l Consumer price inflation remained subdued at 2 percent in 2002. 0 The appreciation of the real effective exchange rate since the early 1990s has stopped, and external competitiveness still appears broadly adequate. Both the real effective exchange rate and unit labor costs in export industries have been relatively constant since 200 1. However, low productivity growth, some loss of market share in the United States in recent years (relative to the rest of Central America), and signs of incipient wage pressures from the nontradable sector suggest an emerging competitiveness problem (Box 1). l Reflecting still adequate external competitiveness, total exports grew by 7.4 percent in 2002. This growth was mainly in nontraditional commodities and maquila, whereas weak world market prices resulted in a 21 percent decline in the value of traditional exports (coffee, sugar, and shrimp) in 2002. Nonetheless, the external current account deficit increased from 1.3 percent of GDP in 200 1, to 2.9 percent in 2002 as insurance reimbursements after the 2001 earthquakes declined sharply. l Domestic interest rates have declined: nominal rates dropped by about 500 bps in 2001 and a further 220 bps in 2002, to average levels of 3.4 percent for deposits and 7.9 percent for loans. However, staff studies suggest that dollarization can only explain at most one-third of this decline; the remainder was largely the result of declining interest rates in the United States.2 7. At the same time, output growth remains low, and there are developments in the fiscal and financial sector areas that warrant close attention: 0 Domestic investment remains sluggish, despite the decline in interest rates. Hence, output growth continues to be disappointing, just 2 percent a year during 2001-02, implying no per capita growth. a The fiscal position has deteriorated over the last two years, reflecting in large part reconstruction expenditures after the two earthquakes in 200 1. The overall deficit 2 This is based on econometric work discussed further in Chapter III of the Selected Issues paper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- grew from 3 percent of GDP in 2000 to 4.6 percent in 2002, while public sector debt increased by nearly 10 percentage points of GDP to a level of almost 40 percent of GDP at end-2002. Although new tax measures in 2002 raised revenue by 0.6 per- centage points of GDP, expenditures increased by 0.9 percentage points of GDP on account of reconstruction expenditures, a one-time tine imposed on the state electricity company, and the continuing increases in pension transfers. l Dollarization appears to have encouraged a rapid increase in the banking sector’s regional activities, both through cross-border lending to corporate clients in the region and by expanding their physical presence in other countries (Box 2). The principal reasons for this regionalization appear to be a combination of limited credit demand domestically, and the practice of banks following corporate clients in their regional expansion. Although regionalization allows banks to better diversify their portfolios, it also exposes them to new risks-in particular currency and sovereign transfer risk. 8. The outlook for 2003 suggests only minor changes in the main macroeconomic indicators compared to the last few years: Economic growth is projected to remain practically unchanged from 2002 at 2.2 percent. In January 2003, El Salvador joined the other Central American countries in starting negotiations for a regional free trade agreement with the United States. This agreement is expected to encourage some new investments as exporters start to position themselves for an expansion in trade. Domestic demand will otherwise remain weak because of the uncertainties before the presidential elections in 2004. Consumer price inflation is expected to increase from 1.9 percent to 2.9 percent, reflecting higher oil prices internationally and likely wage pressures after the increase in minimum wages. This increase in minimum wages (by 5 percent in maquila and 10 percent in service sectors) was part of a package of stimulus measures announced in April this year. The package also included an increase in pension transfers, additional support for the coffee sector, and higher investments by the electricity company. The combined fiscal cost of these measures in 2003 is estimated at 0.6 percent of GDP. Still, the fiscal deficit for 2003 is expected to decline to 4.1 percent of GDP (i.e., down by ‘/z percentage point), as the cost of these stimulus measures will be more than offset by lower extraordinary spending, including on reconstruction. The external current account deficit is projected to widen from 2.7 percent of GDP to 3.2 percent because of rising interest payments and higher oil import costs in 2003.

The March 2003 elections for the National Assembly resulted in a political environment that has significantly reduced the prospect for near-term economic adjustment and reforms. The legislature has become more fractious-no party has a majority-the government is significantly weakened, and the opposition is calling for a sharp reversal of the reform process, including dollarization. Therefore, the authorities could not rule out increased pressure for populist measures and emphasized that new adjustment initiatives were unlikely until after the presidential elections in March 2004. They expressed deep concern that controversial proposals, e.g., for a tax increase, might reinforce the view that dollarization has not lived up to expectations. The authorities felt that, given the public’s current strong preference for U.S. dollars, a reintroduction of the coldn could severely undermine confidence, encourage capital outflows, and result in a steep devaluation. 10. The authorities believed that one reason for the outcome of the recent Assembly elections was an inadequate communications strategy. In their view, they had failed to explain to the public the purpose and potential benefits of the reforms they have pursued. Absent any adjustment measures in 2003, the mission therefore encouraged the authorities- as a de minimus approach-to enhance public understanding of the importance of continued macroeconomic stability and to build momentum for reforms that could be implemented once a new administration takes office. 11. The authorities also pointed out that the political situation had limited their ability to implement much of the policy advice from the 2002 Article IV consultation. This advice emphasized the need for a strong fiscal adjustment combined with building up a liquidity cushion in the central bank, strengthening financial sector supervision, and continuing productivity-enhancing structural reforms. While progress has been made in improving the regulatory framework for the financial sector, measures in the other areas are still pending. A. Medium-Term Framework 12. Notwithstanding these political constraints, the authorities agreed that a substantial strengthening of policies was required to address medium-term vulnerabilities: l Continued high public sector financing requirements and increasing public debt, resulting in continued dependence on international financial markets, where perceptions about risks in emerging economies have increased sharply. Indeed, both Moody’s and Fitch have recently changed their economic outlooks for El Salvador from “stable” to “negative.” Weaknesses in the financial sector, including exposure to regional risk, large share of public sector debt instruments in the asset portfolio, exposure to impaired assets Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- that now represent substantial contingent fiscal liabilities (Box 3), and the absence of lender-of-last-resort facilities; l A possible erosion of external competitiveness if wage pressures emerge,3 the low growth in total factor productivity continues,4 and El Salvador’s low ranking in international comparisons of institutional quality and governance are not addressed.5 13. The mission argued that an early strengthening of policies would be the most effective way to reinforce confidence and minimize what would otherwise be key vulnerabilities. In this context, two illustrative medium-term fiscal scenarios were discussed (Box 4): (i) a baseline where a combination of no fiscal adjustment and weaknesses in the financial sector-including a possible need to absorb large contingent liabilities into public debt-would generate confidence problems, little or no increase in investment, and thus a significant medium-term drag on future economic growth; (ii) an adjustment scenario where a fiscal consolidation and a rapid build-up of a substantial liquidity cushion (of US$500 million) in 2004-05 would raise national saving and investment, strengthen confidence and bolster economic growth. Under the baseline the public debt ratio and gross financing requirements would continue to rise, while the adjustment scenario would result in a reduction in the public debt ratio to about 35 percent by 2010 and much lower gross financing requirements. 14. The authorities noted several points that, in their judgment, made a policy strengthening less urgent: 0 El Salvador’s long record of macroeconomic stability, even during the civil war, would contribute to alleviating emerging confidence issues. 0 Economic growth over the medium term will be boosted significantly by: (i) CAFTA as foreign and domestic firms position themselves to benefit from additional trade; and (ii) current efforts to improve conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises.6 a The impact on external competitiveness of the recent increase in minimum wages is likely to be limited. Only about 10 percent of the labor force in maquila enterprises is paid the minimum wage; the other 90 percent is paid salaries well above this level. 3 There has been no increase in average real wages and minimum real wages have declined sharply over the past four-five years. 4 See Loayza et. al. (World Bank, 2002, mimeo.) and Chapter II in the Selected Issues paper. 5 See Chapter VI in the Selected Issues paper. 6 These measures include facilitating their access to credit, information, services (such as training) and technical assistance, as well as fostering the formation of producer associations.

While growth could be higher than assumed in the baseline, the staff representatives noted that growth alone will not suffice to bring about a significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio. El Salvador’s record of extensive structural reforms and macroeconomic stability has created a solid basis for achieving higher growth in the future. However, accomplishing a target debt-to-GDP ratio of around 35 percent in 2010, similar to the adjustment scenario above, would require an annual growth rate much higher than what can realistically be expected from these reforms-about 10 percent.7 The mission therefore reiterated the urgency of a strong fiscal adjustment, especially given El Salvador’s continued exposure to adverse shocks that could adversely affect growth. B. Fiscal Policy and Reform 16. The staff representatives noted that a fiscal adjustment of about 3 percentage points of GDP would be consistent with the adjustment scenario above. Moreover, it would be important to provide additional resources to strengthen the social safety net, which would require further fiscal adjustment. In light of El Salvador’s low level of fiscal revenues compared to other countries in the region (tabulation below), the mission therefore suggested a number of possible tax measures and presented estimates of the fiscal impact (second tabulation below). The staff representatives also argued that the highly generous early retirement provisions, enabling many workers to retire before age 50, should be abolished.

The authorities agreed with the need to reduce the fiscal deficit by 2-3 percent of GDP, but reiterated that the political environment would make any substantive fiscal adjustment, in particular tax increases, impossible in 2003. They thought, however, that: l recent improvements in tax enforcement are starting to pay dividends, as evidenced by the increased collection of VAT in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period 2002 (about 0.3 percent of GDP on an annual basis). Key elements in this improvement are an enhanced database on large taxpayers and better cross- checking of invoices and tax returns. l CAFTA is expected to contribute to significant growth of formal sector, thus bringing more activity into the tax net. Combined with the phasing out of reconstruction expenditures, this would contribute to improving the medium-term fiscal picture, and ease the need for upfront fiscal adjustment. 18. The staff representatives acknowledged the improvements in tax collections this year, but reiterated the view that a large fiscal consolidation is urgent. In particular, staff representatives noted that: (i) CAFTA is likely to be about revenue neutral-the revenue loss from reduced import tariffs of about 0.5 percent of GDP (staffs estimate) would likely be offset by higher excise and VAT revenues on imports of consumer goods. However, much of the prospective expansion following the implementation of CAFTA would likely come in maquila industries, and thus be outside the tax net; and (ii) the reduction in reconstruction expenditures will be partially offset by the increasing transition cost of the pension reform.* C. Strengthening of the Financial Sector 19. Progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2001 FSSA report has been somewhat mixed.’ There has been considerable progress in strengthening the * Chapter IV of the Selected Issues Paper. 9 Chapter VII of the Selected Issues Paper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- regulatory framework and modernizing the payment system, but five broad areas merit further and immediate attention: 0 assessment of financial soundness based on more comprehensive indicators; l addressing new supervisory challenges resulting from the regionalization of the banking system; a strengthening the safety net under the financial system; 0 improving the performance of public financial institutions; and l allowing more portfolio diversification in the private pension funds. 20. Current financial soundness indicators provide an incomplete picture of the position in the financial system: these indicators suggest that nonperforming loans are 3- 4 percent and declining, provisioning is increasing, and profitability is improving. However, banks have considerable exposure to impaired assets-mainly nonperforming loans to the coffee sector and repossessed collateral (illiquid and with market value substantially below book value). When these are included, the nonperforming loan ratio is about 12-13 percent and increasing, and provisioning against nonperforming loans is 30-40 percent rather than about 110 percent. Moreover, all financial institutions have considerable exposure to public debt (20-30 percent of total assets), which is priced daily in secondary markets. If confidence problems regarding fiscal sustainability arose, the price of this debt, and thus a considerable portion of the financial system’s assets, might deteriorate very rapidly. Moreover, the liquidity of this debt would suffer, increasing banks’ funding risk. 21. The regionalization of the financial sector will require improved supervision of cross-border lending and of financial conglomerates. Staff representatives discussed with the authorities what legal and regulatory changes would be necessary and suggested that this issue be explored in more detail with the follow-up FSAP mission later in 2003.” The authorities recognized that supervision and regulations of cross-border activities are not yet at international standards. Still, they noted steps underway to address these shortcomings through contacts established with supervisory agencies in the region to strengthen cooperation, including future on-site inspections of Salvadoran financial institutions located abroad, and discussions with IDB to finance a system of consolidated supervision to standardize accounting rules and monitor lending to nonresidents. lo Under current law, supervision is only required of conglomerates when Salvadoran nationals own more than 50 percent of the international holding. Some of the major domestic banks are now in the process of organizing themselves as conglomerates. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13- 22. The safety net under the financial system needs strengthening to bolster confidence in financial sector soundness. The staff representatives pointed in particular to the absence of a lender of last resort, the low level of NIR in excess of banks’ liquidity deposits, and the meager capitalization of the deposit insurance agency (IGD). l1 Referring to the medium-term adjustment scenario, staff representatives recommended that a portion of the precautionary liquidity buffer could be channeled toward increasing the capital base for the IGD. The authorities expressed some concerns about the moral hazard problems associated with liquidity buffers in general, and noted that they did not see the IGD as a key instrument in building confidence in the financial system. 23. Although performance of the public financial institutions has improved slightly, further steps are necessary: l The most critical issue is the Social Housing Fund (FSV), created to provide home financing to low-income borrowers. FSV is-of the four public financial institutions-by far the largest, it faces ongoing difliculties in recovering its loans (impaired loans currently amount to 25 percent of its portfolio), and it has ambitious expansion plans. l2 The remaining institutions, two state-owned deposit money banks and a second-tier development bank are rapidly losing importance in the financial system. The two deposit money banks have been restructured and downsized, bringing them to slight profitability in 2002. Combined, they now represent only 2.5 percent of total assets and deposits of the banking system. Still, their NPL ratios continue to be high (18.5 percent on average). The development bank has a low level of NPLs, amounting to 2 percent of total portfolio, and is gradually losing market share as a result of competition from The Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) and higher banking sector access to international credit. 24. The portfolios of the private pension funds are heavily tilted toward public sector debt instruments (about 86 percent of total assets) and insufficiently diversified. These funds are currently not allowed to invest abroad but are required to allocate a certain share of new investments each year in FSV bonds.13 FSV thus has a captive market for its l1 As of end-2002, the capital base of the IGD was about US$50 million, equivalent to about 2 percent of insured deposits and sufficient only to cover such deposits in a few small banks. To cover insured deposits in any of the large banks would require a capital base of about US$450 million. l2 Measures to a FSV’ weaknesses are linked to the private pension funds and are discussed in paragraph 24 below. i3 This share is 25 percent in 2003, and will be reduced gradually over time to reach 10 percent in 20 13.

While agreeing that access to mortgage financing should be as widely available as possible, the mission warned that the combinations of FSV’s poor record of loan recovery and the 100 percent government guarantee on their bonds present a potential for a substantial increase in contingent fiscal liabilities. The mission therefore recommended that: l The forthcoming FSAP mission should assess measures to achieve a substantial strengthening of FSV’s institutional capacity for risk assessment and loan recovery, and the government guarantee on any new FSV bond issue should be eliminated. l The requirement for private pension funds to invest in FSV bonds should be lifted and these funds should be allowed to invest in high-quality foreign instruments. The authorities responded that a new law, that would allow investments in foreign assets by pension funds, is ready to go to the Assembly. D. Central Bank Operations 25. The mission recommended measures that would reconstitute the central bank into an institution more compatible with the dollarization regime. A number of features of current central bank operations, e.g., the absence of a lender of last resort, the conduct of liquidity operations, and the remaining large inventory of coZ& notes, may serve to raise questions about the strength and irreversibility of the new monetary regime. The recommended measures included: l4 l Strengthen the safety net under the financial system by reintroducing a limited lender of last resort (LOLR) facility in the central bank. Staff representatives suggested that the central bank should be in a position to provide liquidity support to individual banks if: (i) there are clear indications that the nature of the banks’ difficulties is a short-term liquidity problem, and (ii) the support can be guaranteed by adequate collateral. The LOLR facility would be funded through a combination of the three contingent credit lines currently under negotiation,15 about US$200 million of the liquidity cushion accumulated under the medium-term adjustment scenario, and current excess reserves in the central bank, a total of about US$650 million. l Cancel all central bank liquidity operations with central bank paper. The stock of central bank paper currently outstanding should be converted into central government bonds, and all liquidity management on behalf of the ministry of finance I4 These measures would require amendments to the monetary integration law of 2000, which was the legal vehicle to introduce dollarization. l5 The authorities are negotiating three contingent credit lines for US$lOO million each (with IDB, CABEI, and a syndicate of private banks, respectively).

By April 2003, the residual stock of coldn notes was about US$745 million, or 5 percent of GDP. 26. The authorities had a number of reservations to these recommendations. They acknowledged that an LOLR facility, in combination with a strengthened IGD, would improve the financial sector safety net, but reiterated their unease about the moral hazard problems associated with such facilities. They also noted that private banks have substantial liquidity reserves as well as their own contingent credit lines. Moreover, they saw no reason to stop issuing central bank paper since their stated objective of these issues is to manage central bank liquidity and there is no evidence that these operations influence domestic interest rates.16 The staff representatives responded that, as long as these liquidity operations are conducted with the same type of central bank paper and through the same channels as the pre-dollarization open market operations, there remains a clear possibility that the central bank is sending mixed signals to the market. They also noted that, since the coZ6n remains a legal tender in parallel with the U.S. dollar, there are difficult legal obstacles to any significant reduction of the stock of colones. E. Institutional and Governance Issues17 27. Staff noted that international comparisons of governance and institutional quality typically rank El Salvador quite low. According to the Governance Research Indicator Country Snapshot (GRICS) from the World Bank, which measures perceptions of institutional quality across six dimensions,18 El Salvador’s overall ranking in 2002 is above those of Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Honduras but well below those of Costa Rica, Panama, Chile, and Mexico. Moreover, the perception of El Salvador’s institutional quality has been deteriorating since 1998 across all dimensions, except for political stability. This can be attributed to the lack of confidence in the judiciary, the high prevalence of crime and I6 In a dollarized economy one would expect the domestic interest rates to move in tandem with U.S. rates over the medium and long term-this is largely borne out by monthly data in Figure 2. However, in the presence of inertia and information asymmetries, these liquidity operations could nonetheless result in spikes in domestic rates over the short term. To test for this would require daily data-not yet available-of interest rates and bond auctions. l7 See also Chapter VI of the Selected Issues Paper. l8 The six dimensions are: public participation in the political process, political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- violence, concerns on the capacity of the government to implement institutional reforms, as well as doubts on the enforcement capacity of regulators. 28. The authorities argued that these comparisons gave a highly distorted picture of El Salvador. In particular, they noted that there has been significant improvement in many indicators over the past few years: (i) El Salvador no longer has problems with security (compared to three years ago, when the present government took office), and (ii) there are some problems with the judicial system, but no more than in most other countries. Moreover, they felt that multilateral institutions exaggerated the importance of institutions for growth. They did, however, recognize that an upgrading of human resources, especially through improved technical training, would be critical to promote growth. F. Other Issues 29. There has been limited progress on structural reforms. The labor market is reasonably flexible with few restrictions on hiring and firing. However, hourly wages are not allowed (firms must pay wages by the half day) and overtime rates are extremely high. Legislation has been prepared to address these shortcomings, and the authorities indicated that passage of this was possible this year. At the same time, the authorities indicated that further steps to increase private sector participation in the economy, including privatizing the electricity company CEL would be impossible under current political circumstances. 30. On external sector issues, El Salvador has accepted the obligations under Art. VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains a system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. There have been no changes to the trade regime since the 2002 Article IV consultation. Staff inquired about the authorities’ response to the recent WTO Trade Policy Review; this response is still under preparation. 31. An anti-money laundering law was passed in June 1999. It requires each bank to have a “compliance official.” The superintendency of banks (SSF) issues guidelines to explain the duties of bank officials. Criminal prosecution is carried out by a special unit (Unidad de Investigation Financiera, UIF) at the Attorney General’s office. Limits for a single transaction are set at US$57,000 but, in practice, banks monitor transactions for smaller amounts. Banks report directly to the UIF, with a copy to the superintendency. If the SSF detects suspicious activities, it can directly report to the UIF III. STAFF APPRAISAL 32. Over the past decade, El Salvador has established a solid track record of comprehensive reforms and generally sound financial policies. This contributed to the strong recovery in the years after the end of the civil war in 1992, and eventually resulted in an investment grade rating in international financial markets in 1997. 33. Despite these reforms, economic performance has weakened considerably over the past four-five years: growth has been low, the fiscal position has deteriorated, and new Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- challenges have emerged in the financial sector. While some of this weakening stems from a series of adverse terms of trade shocks and natural disasters, growth has also been undermined by sluggish private investment and low productivity growth. 34. The key vulnerability for the economy now lies in the prospect of continued large fiscal deficits and weaknesses in the financial sector. Moreover, there is a clear possibility of an erosion of external competitiveness if recent wage increases result in substantial wage pressure and productivity growth remains low. Although these factors do not suggest a high probability of a near term crisis, they could, if left unchecked, set the stage for serious macroeconomic imbalances over the medium term. Under current fiscal policy, the public sector financing requirement will remain large and public debt will continue to increase over the medium term. Concerns about fiscal sustainability could rapidly translate into an erosion of confidence in the solidity of the financial sector, and-given the high concentration of the system in a few major institutions-make the system highly vulnerable to systemic problems. Continuing concern about public debt sustainability would also weaken confidence in the investment climate and thus undermine future growth. 35. Addressing these vulnerabilities, and preventing emerging concerns in financial markets from deepening, is therefore a matter of considerable priority. This will require a series of comprehensive measures regarding fiscal policy, financial sector management, the role of the central bank, and structural reforms. 36. A considerable strengthening of the fiscal position, improving the primary balance by about 3 percentage points of GDP, is necessary. El Salvador has a low share of fiscal revenues relative to GDP compared to the rest of Latin America. In the staffs view, a stronger revenue effort is therefore needed, primarily through an increase in VAT and excise rates and an extension of the income tax to include banks’ international transactions. Although progress is clearly being made in strengthening tax administration and enforcement, evasion remains a considerable problem. Additional revenues could be recouped, and a more equitable distribution of the tax burden achieved, through continued efforts in the administrative area. On the spending side, the staff also considers the current early retirement provisions to be inequitable and costly, and their early elimination would contribute significantly to the fiscal effort. 37. In the financial sector, some progress has been achieved in implementing the recommendations of the FSSA report, but significant weaknesses remain. The soundness of financial institutions should be assessed on a more comprehensive basis, including impaired assets, and the supervision of financial conglomerates and cross-border lending operations improved. The introduction of a limited lender-of-last-resort facility and increasing the capital position of the deposit insurance agency would strengthen the financial sector safety net. The private pension funds are excessively exposed to bonds from the Social Housing Fund, and regulatory changes should be introduced to allow more diversified portfolios, including by investing in high-quality foreign assets. Finally, a restructuring of the Social Housing Fund is necessary, principally by strengthening its risk assessment and loan recovery capacity.

A key element in this regard would be the discontinuation of the central bank’s liquidity operations with its own paper, so as to remove any impression that regular open market operations still continue. It would also be important to dispose much faster than at present of the large inventory of coldn notes in the vaults of the central bank.. 39. Structural measures should focus on productivity-enhancing reforms. In the staffs view, two areas stand out as particularly important. First, completing the agenda of reforms already in the pipeline, such as passing the legislation to introduce further flexibility in the labor market, privatizing the remainder of the electricity sector, and moving forward the sale of concessions in the transportation sector. Second, El Salvador’s low and deteriorating ranking in international comparisons of institutional quality needs to be addressed. Effective institutions establishes the “rules of the game” and thus reduce uncertainty, improves the basis for decision-making, and fosters efficiency. 40. Many of these adjustment and reform measures are no doubt difficult to implement under current political circumstances. Staff stressed, however, that on current policies the vulnerabilities in the Salvadoran economy-and concern about these vulnerabilities in financial markets-are highly unlikely to diminish. Albeit ambitious, the proposed reform agenda therefore carries substantial medium-term benefits. 41. Economic statistics allow for a close monitoring of economic developments, and few weaknesses remain in the statistical system. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with El Salvador be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

External Competitiveness Three approaches were used to assess competitiveness (Figure 3): The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) and Unit Labor Cost (ULC). The REER appreciated sharply (by 45 percent) between 1992 and 2000, but has since been stable as the domestic inflation has been at or below that of trading partners. During the same period, ULC in the export industries declined by 48 percent, reflecting both productivity gains in these industries, and declining real average wages in the tradable sectors. Exports and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Although total exports 1998- 2002 declined at an annual average rate of 1 percent, net maquila exports grew by an annual average rate of about10 percent. However, El Salvador appears to be losing market shares in the United States: both total and net maquila exports were less dynamic in El Salvador than in the rest of other Central America..’ Over the same period, El Salvador attracted about US$220 million annually in FDI, significantly less than both Guatemala and Costa Rica. Large family remittances, demand for nontradable, and wage pressures. Family remittances have increased steadily to a current level of 14 percent of GDP. While a considerable portion finance imports of consumer goods, they have also generated a sharp increase in demand for nontradable. Both employment and real wages have therefore increased far more rapidly in the nontradable than in the tradable sectors. However, a large portion in the labor force is still in the informal economy, and the tradable sectors-especially maquila-do not yet have any problems in attracting labor. Based on the above, the external competitiveness appears broadly appropriate at end 2002. The REER appreciation has been counterbalanced by a sharp decline in ULC, and maquila exports are growing rapidly, albeit not nearly as rapidly as in the rest of the region. The demand for nontradable generated by high family remittances do not appear to have generated excessive wage pressure in the economy. There are, however, indications that El Salvador may face problems in maintaining external competitiveness over the medium term: the country appears to be losing market shares in maquila exports, several studies suggest low growth in total factor productivity (see Chapter I in the Selected Issues Paper), wage pressures may emerge following the first increase in the minimum wage in five years, and El Salvador is losing ground in international comparisons of governance and institutional quality (see Chapter VI in the Selected Issues Paper). 1 A similar picture emerges from data on U.S. textile imports from Central America 1998-2002.

Dollarization and the Banking System Dollarization appears to have had a significant impact on the Salvadoran banking system through at least three channels: . l l > > A significant revenue loss as a result of the disappearance of interest margins on coldn denominated operations (which were a full percentage point higher than the margin on dollar denominated operations prior to dollarization) as well as the loss of commissions on foreign exchange transactions. However, banks have kept overall profit margins stable through cost cutting and by introducing fees for other services previously provided for free. More aggressive efforts by domestic banks to maintain market share in the domestic credit market. Until the third quarter of 2002, Salvadoran borrowers (especially prime corporate clients) preferred foreign credit lines: credit from domestic banks declined, and foreign credit lines rose sharply (Table, top panel). Since then, domestic banks have started to regain market shares at the expense of foreign credit lines by offering better terms, e.g., longer maturities. Credit from domestic banks has recovered, and credit from foreign banks is increasing at a much slower pace. Increased regionalization of Salvadoran banks. This is taking two forms: Increased lending to nonresidents, primarily corporate in the region, from domestic banks. This lending has been increasing significantly since dollarization (Table, bottom panel). The main reason appears to be the slow growth and limited demand for credit domestically, combined with better prices by Salvadoran banks since they have access to lower cost credit from abroad than banks from other countries in the region. Several of the large domestic banks have now reached the ceiling on lending to nonresidents for which Superintendency authorization is not required (75 percent of net worth) and are now requesting higher limits. Increased physical presence of Salvadoran banks in the rest of Central America. This expansion is taking place through a variety of ownership structures. The key motivation for this expansion is in part to circumvent the limits on lending to non- residents, and in part to follow corporate clients who are expanding from El Salvador to other countries.

Contingent Fiscal Liabilities The most important contingent fiscal liabilities originate from both private and public financial institutions, and include nonperforming loans, loans to coffee sector, repossessed collateral, and real estate exposure. One of the following features characterize these assets: a They carry a government guarantee. This guarantee is explicit in the case of loans to the coffee sector, now consolidated under the public Ficafe trust fund. Following the sharp decline in coffee price from 1998 onwards, the government implemented in 2001 a program to reschedule all loan to the coffee sector to much longer maturities. The guarantee is more implicit for loans from the public financial institutions whose financial viability remain in question. a They represent a substantial risk to the bank’s balance sheet; repossessed collateral which is often highly illiquid and with market value well below book value, and real estate exposure, where prices are volatile and much of the underlying asset values could be damaged in natural disasters. The table below illustrates three possible estimates of the potential amount of contingent fiscal liabilities that could-under adverse circumstances-become an explicit part of public debt. The three scenarios are denoted optimistic, middle, and pessimistic respectively, illustrated by rough assumptions about the share of each asset class that would be lost due to some adverse shock. Under these assumptions, the aggregate amount of contingent liabilities that could become an explicit public liability range from about 3 percent of GDP to 9 percent.

Medium-Term Public Debt Sustainability A substantial fiscal adjustment will be necessary to necessary to gain better control of the debt dynamics, lower funding risks, and boost the central bank’s liquidity cushion. This can be illustrated by three scenarios for public debt: a A “baseline” scenario, which assumes only a moderate recovery in growth, from 2.2 percent in 2003 to 3 percent in 2005 and beyond, and no fiscal adjustment except for the programmed phase-out of reconstruction expenditures by 2005. The primary deficit would therefore decline from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2002 to 0.9 percent in 2005 and beyond. 0 A “shock” scenario, where the assumption of growth and fiscal stance are the same as in the baseline, but the public sector absorbs 5 percentage points of GDP in contingent liabilities in 2004 (i.e., the middle scenario in Box 3). l An “adjustment” scenario, which assumes: (i) a fiscal consolidation of 3 percent of GDP implemented in 2004; (ii) additional public sector borrowing in 2004 and 2005 to finance the build-up of a liquidity cushion of US$500 million; (iii) higher growth, at 4.5 percent annually from 2005, generated through higher investment and improved confidence.’ The two key features of these scenarios are: (i) in the baseline, public debt would increase to 56 per- cent of GDP by 2010 (61 percent in the “shock” scenario), but would decline to 36 percent in the adjustment scenario; (ii) in the baseline the public sector gross financing requirements would increase to US$1.6 billion (7 percent of GDP) by 2010, but remain stable at half this level in the adjustment scenario.

Hypothetically, bringing growth up to 4.5 percent in this latter period would, other things equal, have required the annual TFP contribution to increase to 0.8 percent, or even less if investment also increased. Given the much higher TFP contribution in the earlier period, such an increase should be well within the feasible realm. (Source: C. Acevedo (2002) La Experiencia de El Salvador durante 1950- 2000).

In that connection, the Bank has made progress in creating and modifying accounting policies with the expectation that the 2004 financial statements will be IAS compliant. The Board of Directors, in its session of January 20, 2003, approved the change of Audit Committee members. The Audit Committee is now comprised of two non-executive directors of the Bank. VIII. Exchange Arrangements: Effective January 1,2001, the dollar became legal tender and circulates freely. The dollar is used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange, with no limitations. All payments may be made in either dollars or colones. The BCR has the obligation to exchange colones in circulation for dollars upon request from banks, at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per US$l . As a result, El Salvador’s exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified from the conventional pegged category to the exchange rate with no separate legal tender category. IX. Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 19,2002 (SM/02/201; 07/05/02) and (SUR/O2/86; 08/01/02). El Salvador is under the standard 12-month cycle. X.

Recent and Planned IBRD Activities The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for El Salvador was discussed by the World Bank Board on December 4, 2001. It aims to promote faster growth and deepen the poverty agenda, and also fosters private sector-led growth. The CAS includes a base case lending scenario of US$270 million. The Bank’s portfolio in El Salvador includes seven active projects, totaling US$397 million net of cancellations, of which about US$236 million remain undisbursed as of May 3 1,2003. The Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction and Health Services Extension Project (US$l42.6 million) represents about half of the CAS base case scenario. Most recently, a Judicial Reform Project (US$18.2 million) was approved by the Board in August 2002. Two projects are under preparation, Rural Community Development and Secondary Education.

Money and banking statistics Several financial institutions do not distinguish transactions by resident and nonresident institutional units. Given that Salvadoran banks have been active in lending elsewhere in the region, this creates difficulty in the interpretation of the monetary and credit aggregates. In the context of the new monetary arrangement the use of the principle of residence acquires more importance, since all accounts are denominated in U.S. dollars. Also, there is a need to improve estimates of broad money by including all financial intermediaries in the financial system. Public sector statistics The outstanding issues are the adequate compilation of consolidated central government data that includes budgetary, extra-budgetary and social security accounts, the consistency of domestic debt data with financing transactions and the processing of data on the operations of the local governments for publication in the GFSY. The ministry of finance conducts a quarterly survey of 50 local governments, including all the largest, but the reporting of the survey is not consistent. Also, information on the financing of the fiscal deficit needs to be improved. Real sector statistics Progress needs to be made in obtaining more timely information from enterprise, household and agricultural surveys for the national accounts. The authorities are planning to implement a new survey in 2003 to update the weights in the consumer price index. They have recently begun compiling a producer price index, which replaces the wholesale price index. External sector statistics The quality and consistency of the customs declaration, processed electronically, has to improve. Also, a few weaknesses remain in the measurement of cross-border capital flows in the financial account. El Salvador compiles and disseminates International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity data. The central bank sent methodology notes describing the compilation methods for balance of payments statistics which were included in Part 3 of the 2002 Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. External vulnerability indicators The central bank has started to compile information about the external indebtedness of the nonbank private sector.
