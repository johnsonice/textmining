INTRODUCTION 1. The Republic of the Marshall Islands @MI) consists of a group of atolls and islands in the central Pacific with a total population of about 52,000. The economy is highly dependent on United States (U.S.) financing provided through the economic provisions of the Compact of Free Association (the Compact) (Box 1). Economic activity is dominated by the public sector, and the private sector has developed largely to meet the demands of the government and its workers. Small contributions also come from agriculture, fisheries, and tourism. The U.S. dollar is used as the domestic currency in the RMI. 2. Long-term economic performance has been disappointing, Reel GDP Growth 6 with real activity contracting by an 1 average of 1% percent per annum over the past decade. With a high birth ’ rate only partly offset by outward J migration, per capita GDP has declined 4 more sharply and currently stands at 4 $1,862. Although this per capita income .,* level is relatively high among Pacific -I5 island countries, the RMI ranks poorly according to the UNDP Human Poverty .‘I Index, in part because of the considerable inequality between urban areas and the outer islands. 3. In line with the Compact agreement, two stepdowns in U.S. funding have already taken place. Domestic adjustment was postponed following the first stepdown in 1991 by recourse to external commercial borrowing (secured against future Compact funds) which added to an already high external debt burden. However, following the second stepdown in October 1996, and faced with a heavy external debt service burden, significant domestic adjustment was required. With an independent exchange rate policy precluded by the use of the U.S. dollar, fiscal policy has borne the burden of this adjustment. Under an AsDB-assisted Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP), government employment has been reduced by 30 percent and government expenditure by 13 percentage points of GDP (if large one-off capital expenditures are excluded) since I Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- Box 1. Financial Relations Between the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the United States I’he United Nations created the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) in 1947, with the United States (U.S.) as the trustee. In 1978, the Republic of the Marshall Islands RMI) voted to separate from the TTPI and become self-governing under a constitution that :ame into effect in 1979. As part of the post-Trustee relationship, the Compact of Free 4ssociation (the Compact) was signed between the RMI and the U.S. in 1982. The Compact :ventually came into force in November 1986. The three goals of the Compact are: (i) to secure self-government for the RMI; (ii) assure certain national security rights for the RMI md the U.S.; and (iii) assist the RMI in its efforts to promote economic self-sufficiency. In a 1986 Compact-related agreement, the U.S. secured access to military facilities on Kwajalein Atoll for 15 years with the right to extend this for an additional 15 years (this was exercised in September 1999). Efforts to promote economic self-suffkiency were to be accomplished primarily through direct financial assistance to the government. The largest funding provision provides specific levels of funding over a 15-year period (1986/87-2000/O 1) with amounts decreasing every five years (Table). These funds are provided to cover Disbursements Under the Compact (In millions of U.S. dollars) general government and capital expenditures (40 percent are I 986/87 - required to be spent on capital mu95 1995196 1996t97 1997i98 199ai99 1999mo expenditures, although this Block grants 155 IS 12 12 I2 12 does not appear to have been Block grant-Kwajalein 64 7 7 7 7 7 met).

Financing levels are partially indexed for inflation. If a new funding agreement is not in place by the time the current one expires in 200 1, there is provision for an additional two years of financing at the average level of the first 15 years ($42 million). The Compact also deals with compensation for nuclear testing in the RMI by establishing a trust fund for $150 million. The income from this fund is allocated for injury compensation and the economic and social development of the communities of the four atolls affected by the testing.

The economic provisions of the Compact agreement expire in October 2001. Formal negotiations with the U.S. over possible financial assistance after this date have yet to begin. However, from the ongoing negotiations with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), it seems likely that the U.S. will aim to provide future assistance in the form of sector specific grants, rather than general budget support. II. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSANDOUTLOOK 5. The economy has stabilized over the past three years. Real GDP grew by L/z percent in 1999/00, following the modest decline in 1998/99, as the fiscal stance became more expansionary and the new tuna loining factory began production (Table 1).3 After rising by 2 percent in 1998199, consumer prices are estimated to have declined by 2 percent in 1999/00 due to the full-year effect of the import duty cut in mid- 1999. 6. The fiscal position has deteriorated, with the surplus declining from 15% percent of GDP in 1997/98 to an estimated 5% percent of GDP in 1999/00 (Table 2). Revenues have fallen due to a decline in external grants (a large, disaster-related, grant was received from the U.S. following Typhoon Paka in December 1997) and the reduction in the general import duty rate from 12 percent to 5 percent in August 1999. Expenditures exceeded budget in the lead-up to the November 1999 election (partly in anticipation of grant funding from Taiwan Province of China that was actually received in June 2000), while a large (3% percent of GDP) subsidy was paid to the Marshall Islands Social Security Administration (MISSA) (Box 2). These surpluses have not been sufficient to cover the large external debt repayments, and usable government financial assets were virtually exhausted by end- 1999/00. Despite a loan from the Development Bank, domestic payment arrears rose to an estimated 1% percent of GDP, and the government imposed a freeze on all non-wage expenditure commitments for the last two weeks of 1999/00. 7. The 2000/01 budget envisages that a large increase in the fiscal surplus to 15 percent of GDP and the contracting of a short-term commercial loan will enable the government to meet its debt service obligations. Current expenditures are budgeted to decline by 7 percent of GDP, due largely to lower subsidies (no allowance is made for further subsidies to MISSA) and a freeze on the wage bill, while revenues are expected to rise with the disbursement of part of the Taiwan Province of China grant, an increase in the general import duty rate from 5 percent to ’ The fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30. ’ While the actual decline in government expenditure since 1994/95 is 35 percentage points of GDP, capital expenditures in 1994/95 were exceptionally high due to the construction of a hotel and a garment factory and the purchase of an aircraft which together totalled 22 percent of GDP. 3 The loining factory fillets and freezes tuna for transportation to the Starkist canning plant in American Samoa.

The Marshall Islands Social Security Administration’ The Marshall Islands Social Security Administration (MISSA) operates four funds. The Retirement Fund pays pension, survivor, and disability benefits, and is financed by employer and employee contributions of 5 percent of wages each. The Basic Health Plan finances off-island medical referrals, while the Healthcare Revenue Fund is used to purchase medical supplies and equipment for the Ministry of Health. These two funds are financed by a further 3% percent/3% percent employer/employee contribution, with 60 percent of the revenue going to the Basic Health Plan. Contributions to these three funds are compulsory for all employers and employees. The Supplemental Health Plan is a voluntary plan which provides additional medical coverage. In recent years, MISSA has begun to run into financial diffkulties. The downsizing of the government has resulted in a decline in total employment, and hence in contributions. However, expenditures have continued to rise. In the Retirement Fund, this has resulted in the drawdown of fund assets in each of the last five years, while the Healthcare Revenue Fund also recorded a deficit in 1999/00. This was financed by intrafund borrowing, in contravention of the MISSA Act. But, it is in the Basic Health Plan Fund that the most immediate financial problems have occurred. The substantial increase in the number of overseas medical referrals, which have risen from only 30 in 199 l/92 to 227 in 1999/00, has resulted in a sharp rise in fund expenditures (Table). This increase in expenses has exhausted the fund’s assets, and it has been unable to meet all its payments to foreign hospitals. Arrears reached nearly $4 million (4% percent of GDP) in mid-2000, Financial Details of the MISSA Basic HeaJth Plan (In millions of U.S. dollars) 1995l96 ‘9!36.97 1997i98 1998l99 1999/00 Contributions to the Fund 3.2 3.9 3.8 - 3.0 2.2 Fundexpenditures 5 3.2 . . . . 6.1 Number of overseas refcnak 259 214 . . . . 227 @crsons) Amage cost of referrals 0.019 0.024 , ._ 0.027 Memorandum ifem: ciovemtnent subsidy 0 0 0 0 3.3 SourccDataprovidcdbyMISA. and the government has been required to provide a $3.3 million subsidy during 1999/00 to reduce outstanding arrears and to finance ongoing expenses. Arrears have now been reduced to around $2 million, with many of these under dispute with the service providers. The MISSA budget for 2000/01 anticipates the need for a further large government subsidy. Despite the very optimistic assumption that the number of overseas referrals will decline to 150, the shortfall between revenues and expenditures is still expected to be around $2.5 million. ’ A full analysis of the financial situation at MISSA is complicated by the lack of audited financial data for the 1997/98 and 1998/99 financial years.

The budget, however, makes no allowance for the repayment of outstanding arrears. 8. Bank lending, which declined sharply during 1995-98, grew by 4% percent (y/y) in June 2000. While business lending has been flat, the stabilization of the economy has underpinned a pick-up in consumer lending and bank deposits, the latter also aided by increased competition among banks to attract time deposits. 9. The current account is estimated to have returned to surplus in 1999/00, following deficits in the preceding two years (Table 3). The services deficit narrowed due to the fees earned from the operations of the tuna factory, while fishing license fees and external grants increased. The trade balance, however, remained in a large deficit (53 percent of GDP). Exports, which have declined sharply since the closure of the domestically-owned fishing company in the mid- 199Os, remained stagnant, while imports were broadly unchanged. After appreciating during 1995-1998, the real effective exchange rate has depreciated modestly in recent years, although there has been little improvement in competitiveness against other Pacific islands whose currencies have undergone larger depreciations during this period.

The external commercial borrowing contracted by the government in the early 1990s will be paid off by July 2001, resulting in a large decline in outstanding debt and in the debt-service ratio. Thereafter, external debt will mostly comprise concessionary loans from the AsDB and the U.S., the latter to the domestic energy and telecommunications companies. 4 The budget was approved by the Nitijela (parliament) after the mission’s departure.

Economic growth is projected to increase to 1 percent in 2000/01, reflecting increased government capital expenditure, financed by external grants from Taiwan Province of China, and the first full year of operation of the tuna factory (Table 5). Inflation is expected to remain moderate at 2% percent, while the current account surplus widens to 12% percent of GDP with the rise in external grants. However, the fiscal situation presents substantial risks to this outlook. III. REPORTONTHEPOLICYDISCUSSIONS 12. The policy discussions focused on: (i) the short-term risks to the economy from the current fiscal situation, and the policy measures needed to maintain macroeconomic stability; and (ii) the reform s needed to invigorate private sector growth over the medium term and to adjust to any reduction in external financing. A. Short-term Macroeconomic Risks and Policy Response 13. The mission expressed disappointment that the 2000/01 budget had not done more to address the fiscal situation, and called for further action to strengthen government finances. At best, the budget will bring about only a modest increase in usable government financial assets, while it makes no provision for the repayment of arrears (1 3h percent of GDP). Further, there are considerable risks to the outlook, most notably that the MISSA health tind will require another large subsidy, but also that fishing license fees will be lower than budgeted given weak international tuna prices. At present, the government has no financial buffer to absorb such unanticipated developments, and there is a substantial risk of a disruption in its service provision. The mission therefore felt that additional fiscal measures were needed to boost usable government financial assets to a more comfortable level and to pay down outstanding arrears. To achieve this, they recommended: the identification of additional expenditure savings, including a review of subsidies to public enterprises; a strengthening in tax administration; an increase in income taxes on higher income earners; and, if necessary, a temporary surcharge on the general import duty rate. They also urged the authorities to take immediate steps to address the financial problems at MISSA to limit the potential drain on budgetary resources. 14. The authorities agreed that the fiscal situation this year was a serious concern, but believed that it was manageable, and saw little scope for additional budgetary measures at present. With regard to the financial problems at MISSA, they explained that it was difficult to limit the number of overseas referrals given community expectations for medical care, so instead they were concentrating on measures to reduce costs-including shifting to lower cost service providers (e.g., in the Philippines rather than the U.S.) and lowering administrative overheads- and to improve the administration of collections. Legislation is also pending to raise the social security contribution rate to 14 percent (7 percent/7 percent for employee/employer), from 10 percent, in early 2001, and it was expected that some of this would go to the health fund. 15. Further, they believed that the government’s financial position would ease considerably after the 2000/01 fiscal year. This, they explained, was because the external commercial borrowing (ECB) contracted in the early 1990s will have been fully repaid by end 2000/01, while they will also receive a higher level of financing from the U.S. during 2001/02- 2002/03 in the increasingly likely event that the Compact negotiations are not concluded by October 200 1. This would allow them to repay the short-term loan they hoped to contract during 2000/01, while the government has committed itself to save one-half of the money being used to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- service the existing ECB ($22.5 million) into the recently established intergenerational fund. The mission welcomed this decision, but thought that a higher proportion should be saved to rebuild government financial assets holdings, while they also urged the government to avoid further external commercial borrowing. 16. The authorities did not think that the Asia crisis, or the loss of competitiveness relative to other Pacific island countries, had had a significant impact on the external sector. While there had been a modest effect on tourist arrivals, the decline in exports since the mid-1990s was mainly due to the collapse of the sole domestic fishing company, rather than demand or competitiveness factors. The mission noted, however, that as the RMI seeks to develop a more vibrant private sector over the medium term, export competitiveness will be an important issue. Given that the use of the U.S. dollar-which the mission and authorities agreed continued to serve the country well by imparting monetary stability-precluded nominal exchange rate adjustment, improving competitiveness would need to focus on lowering the domestic cost structure, particularly through the control of wages (see next Section). B. Generating Sustainable Growth over the Medium-Term 17. The medium-term outlook for the RMI is clouded by the uncertainty about future Compact financing. Long-term adjustment scenarios developed under alternate external financing assumptions illustrate the size of the fiscal adjustment that may be required (Annex I). The challenge for the RMI will therefore be to implement fiscal and structural reforms that put the economy in a stronger position to withstand any decline in Compact assistance and that lay the basis for sustainable, private sector-led, growth. Fiscal policy 18. Despite the fiscal adjustment that has taken place, the government sector in the RMI remains large by the standards of most other small island economies (Box 3). While the geographic and demographic characteristics of the RMI may account for some of this difference, the mission believed there was scope for further fiscal adjustment to reduce government expenditure closer to the regional average, while maintaining service provision. In this context, they noted that while the number of government employees in the RMI now appears to be lower than in other Pacific island countries, their wage levels are much higher. A further decline in government expenditure (as a percent of GDP) would not only create room for private sector activity, but would also allow the continued generation of sizable fiscal surpluses to build-up government financial assets in anticipation of the eventual ending of Compact support. 19. The mission therefore urged the government to establish a medium-term consolidation strategy to continue the fiscal adjustment that occurred under the PSFW. They argued that the stringent control of current expenditures, and the wage bill in particular, would need to remain the cornerstone of this process. The authorities noted that substantial cuts had been made in government employment, and although they would continue to seek reductions in non- core areas, they agreed with the mission that further expenditure adjustment should come mostly from public sector wages, which remain considerably higher than those in the private sector.

Fiscal Structure in Selected Pacific Island Economies . - lo- A comparison of the fiscal structure in the RMI with other Pacific island economies indicates that (Table):’ l The government sector is considerably larger, with government expenditure accounting for 57 percent of GDP. l Current expenditures, in particular spending on wages and salaries, are considerably higher than in other countries in the region (except in the FSM). l The large expenditures on salaries and wages is due to higher public sector wages, while the share of public employment in the total population is lower than in other Pacific island countries. l Spending on health and education is well above the regional average, while capital spending is below average.

The authorities explained that one of their goals was to improve living standards on the outer islands, and this would require a greater resource allocation, particularly for health and education. The mission agreed that it was essential to protect, and improve, the delivery of health and education services, but thought that the efficiency of expenditures in these areas could be improved. They noted that health and education spending in the RMI was high compared to other Pacific island countries, but outcomes (including low school retention rates and the need for medical referrals overseas) were generally poor (Box 4).’ 21. With regard to tax reform, the authorities indicated that their main efforts, at present, were concentrated on improving tax administration as they felt that considerable revenue was going uncollected. They were particularly concerned about compliance with the gross revenue tax (GRT) which was difficult to police given the current resources of the revenue department.6 However, they also noted that while the introduction of a VAT, which had been scheduled for 1998, had been delayed, it had not been removed from the reform agenda. The mission welcomed this as the implementation of a VAT would result in a more efficient tax system, but thought that improvements in administrative capacities would first be needed before its introduction. ’ They also suggested that the government and public enterprises should be made subject to import duties and the gross revenue tax (GRT) to ensure competitive neutrality with the private sector, while tax exemptions granted to private business should be reviewed. 22. Further public enterprise reform is also needed. The mission noted that while the utili services were well-run, the government’s other business activities (mainly in the agriculture, fishing, and tourism sectors) have not been successful, and have been a significant drain on the budget. The authorities responded that subsidies to public enterprises had been reduced substantially in recent years-from $6 million in 1994/95 to $1.5 million in 1999/00-but, because of the risks posed by continued government ownership, they were in the process of developing a strategy that they hoped would result in the privatization of a number of public enterprises. 5 The AsDB’s 1999 human resource development study found that the poor performance of the education system resulted from a lack of: proper facilities, well trained teachers, planning, monitoring and, most importantly, management. 6 The GRT is levied on the gross receipts of private sector businesses at a flat rate of 3 percent. 7 The advantages of a VAT over a tariff will be greater, all else equal, the lower the share of imports in GDP, the smaller the proportion of consumption that is imported, and the larger the share of intermediate goods in imports (see Recent Experience with the Value-Added Tax- Background Paper, EBS/00/14, Supplement 1). While the structure of the RMI economy suggests that the gains may be smaller than for other countries, rough calculations indicate that they are likely to be positive. Further, as the economy develops over the medium-term, the benefits of a VAT will increase. VATS have been successfully introduced in other Pacific island countries (Fiji, Samoa, and Vanuatu).

Government spending on heal 9 percent and 10% percent of GDP respectively (health and education spending are also high in the FSM). On a per capita basis, health spending is much higher than in other countries in the region, while education expenditure (per school age child) is also sizable (Table 1). However, standard health and education indicators suggest that outcomes have been no better, and in some cases worse, than in other Pacific island countries. h and education is relatively high in the RMI, accounting for Table I.

What can be done to improve the efficiency of service delivery? Given the need to improve the quality of health and education outcomes, while also reducing government expenditure over the medium-term, it is essential that improvements are made in the efficiency of service provision. Potential areas for reform, include: reducing expenditures on overseas referrals and focusing more resources on primary health care; increasing flexibility in resource allocation as, at present, personnel decisions are in the hands of the Public Service Commission, with little or no input from the line ministries; improving coordination between different users and purchasers of health supplies (this particularly applies to the Ministry of Health and MISSA in their roles as purchaser and user of medical equipment and supplies, but where effective coordination is lacking); improving the quality providers through better training; and increasing user charges for higher income earners.

The absence of recent audited financial accounts for a number of key public entities, including MISSA and the Development Bank, has undermined accountability, while the presence of a large number of budgetary accounts, and the inter-account transfers that take place between them, makes the ultimate use of funds difftcult to trace. Given these weaknesses, the mission stressed that the intergenerational fund should be governed by clear and transparent regulations and be required to publish regular, independently audited, financial accounts. Financial sector 24. Measures are needed to strengthen the domestic financial infrastructure. Representatives of the commercial banks explained that the lack of collateral and the difficulties of foreclosing on defaulters were significant impediments to business lending (particularly for the two foreign banks as foreigners cannot own land in the RMI). Consequently, a significant proportion of commercial bank assets are held in deposits overseas, while lending is concentrated on consumer loans. Most long-term business loans are extended by.the government owned Development Bank. In response to the mission’s inquiry about solutions to these problems, the authorities said they were working on reforms to both the land and legal systems (see next Section) which they hoped would enable the banks to provide greater support to private sector development. 25. The mission raised concerns about the inadequacy of financial sector supervision. The branches of the two U.S.-based banks are supervised by their home country authorities, and their deposits insured by the FDIC, but supervision of the Bank of the Marshall Islands (BOMI) is undertaken solely by the Banking Commissioner. However, the lack of resources and technical expertise means that this supervision is mostly offsite. This is particularly worrying as the BOMI has been aggressively expanding its consumer lending business over the past year at a time when the foreign banks have been reluctant to lend. While remaining low, reported NPLs of the commercial banks have risen to 2% percent of loans, while the capital adequacy ratio of the BOMI has fallen to slightly below its 15 percent minimum. However, the lack of onsite supervision makes it difficult to assess whether stipulated loan classification and provisioning standards are being complied with. The Development Bank is not subject to supervision, and the absence of recent information on its financial position is a concern. 26. The authorities expressed disappointment at their inclusion on the FATF money laundering and OECD tax haven lists, and their classification by the FSF as a Group III Offshore Financial Center (OFC).’ They stated that no offshore banks or insurance companies are currently operating in the RMI, and that the business of the Trust Company of the Marshall Islands is limited to the registration of ships and international business companies (IBCs) involved in the shipping industry. However, to address international concerns about the lack of anti-money laundering regulations, an amendment to the Banking Act was enacted in October (after the mission’s departure). This criminalizes money laundering, requires customer identification for * Representatives of the RMI attended the outreach meeting on OFC issues in Sydney during September 4-5,200O.

The authorities have also agreed to technical assistance on IBCs and trust companies and to participate in a Module 2 assessment in the context of the OFC initiative. Structural reforms 27. The authorities explained that they were in the process of addressing a number of factors that have impeded private sector development. Foreign investment regulations have been simplified and made more transparent. Under the new Foreign Investment Business Licensing Act, a foreign investor will have to meet clearly specified criteria to obtain a business license from the Foreign Investment Registrar, rather than have to seek Cabinet approval as at present. This is expected to speed up the approval process, while also making it more transparent. However, there will be a reserved list of sectors where foreign investment is not permitted. Efforts are underway to increase the availability of land for commercial use. At present, there are no official records that provide clear and legal evidence of ownership or rights to land. This leads to ownership disputes and uncertainty for potential investors. To address this, the Marshall Islands Development Land Registration Authority Act, which is currently pending in parliament, would establish a land registration system for owners who wish to make their land available to developers. The Act will also standardize lease agreements to ensure that certain minimum requirements are met. Constraints to private sector employment are easing. The $2 per hour minimum wage remains, but is being flexibly interpreted with exemptions given to some exporters. Reforms to simplify non-resident worker recruitment are also being considered. Efforts to strengthen the legal system are also under consideration. In particular, the absence of a bankruptcy law currently makes foreclosure difficult. 28. The mission warmly welcomed these developments, and urged the prompt passage of legislation that is still pending.’ However, they wondered whether the reforms were sufficient in some areas. In particular, there are indications that the foreign investment reserved list could be quite extensive, including both the retail and wholesale sectors, while foreigners would still not be able to own land. 9 Fairbairn and Worrell argue that differences in land tenure systems and low FDI in Pacific island countries as important factors in the more successful private sector development in the. Caribbean than in the Pacific. (Fairbairn, T., and D. Worrell, 1996, South Pacific and Caribbean Island Economies: A Comparative Study, The Foundation for Development Cooperation).

The RMI’s trade regime is relatively open and rated “5” on the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness. The general import duty rate is currently 5 percent, although a number of products are subject to rates ranging from 15-150 percent. The RMI is a member of the South Pacific Forum, and is involved in the Pacific Regional Trade Agreement (PARTA) negotiations which are seeking to achieve a free trade area among Forum Island Countries by 2012. 30. The mission inquired about the impact of the state trading monopoly on the domestic coconut industry. The authorities responded that copra was the key cash crop for the outer islands. While they have tried to introduce some private competition into the collection of the raw copra in recent years, this had not been particularly successful, and, given the small size of the crop, they did not view it as feasible to eliminate the export monopoly. 31. Statistical deficiencies continue to impede effective surveillance. Substantial weaknesses exist, particularly in the balance of payments statistics, but also in the national accounts, monetary, and fiscal areas, while data are not being reported to the Fund on a regular basis. The mission stressed the importance of improving data compilation and reporting data on a regular and timely basis, and asked why the technical assistance that has been provided has not achieved better results. The authorities responded that they were continuing their efforts to strengthen statistical functions, but the lack of suitably qualified staff, as well as high staff turnover, remained significant impediments. 32. The RMI is yet to consent to the Eleventh Quota increase or to accept the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement. - IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 33. Notwithstanding the adjustment undertaken in recent years, major policy challenges lie ahead. The authorities commendably implemented an AsDB-supported reform program to adjust to the decline in Compact financing in 1996. However, this consolidation, together with the impact of a drought, resulted in a large contraction in activity in the mid-1990s. While the economy has since stabilized, growth has not been firmly re-established, and recent fiscal slippages have raised the risk of further disruptions to activity. Considerable policy challenges therefore remain. In the near-term, macroeconomic stability needs to be maintained and the fiscal difficulties addressed. Over the medium-term, growth needs to be invigorated, while the economy adjusts to any further reduction in Compact.funding. 34. The current fiscal situation is a serious concern as usable government financial assets have been virtually exhausted. The 2000/01 budget includes a number of measures to begin to address this situation, but these are not sufficient, and there is a risk of a disruption in government service provision. The staff therefore urges the authorities to implement additional fiscal measures to provide a buffer to absorb unanticipated budgetary shocks during the year. 35. A solution to MISSA’s financial problems is urgently needed. Even under highly optimistic assumptions, a further large government subsidy to the health fund is likely to be required in 2000/O 1. Immediate action is needed to limit this drain on the budget, including by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- reducing the number and cost of overseas medical referrals. Over the longer-term, consideration will need to be given to the structure of the health fund to ensure that its financial viability is restored in the face of rising demand for health services. 36. The medium-term outlook for the economy is clouded by the uncertainty about the level and form of future Compact financing. Given this uncertainty, it is essential that government finances are strengthened to place the economy in a position to withstand any reduction in U.S. financing should it occur. As a start, over the next two years, a large fiscal surplus should be maintained to enable the government to rebuild its financial asset holdings to provide a future income stream and a buffer against shocks. It is also important that the government avoid further external commercial borrowing. 37. While considerable fiscal adjustment has already taken place, further reductions in government current expenditure (as a share of GDP) and steps to boost revenues are still needed. The reduction in expenditure will primarily need to focus on government wages, which remain considerably higher than those in the private sector, and in the region more generally, but also on eliminating subsidies, including by exiting from business activities in the agricultural, tourism, and fisheries sectors. As well as ensuring continued fiscal surpluses, this will create more room for capital expenditures, which have been severely squeezed in recent years, while allowing health and education services to be protected. Reforms to improve the efficiency of the tax system, most notably through the introduction of the delayed VAT, are also needed. 38. Greater transparency and accountability in the use of public funds is required. Priority should be placed on ensuring that audited accounts are published for each public enterprise on an annual basis, while a reduction in the number of separate budgetary accounts would improve the transparency of the final use of public funds. The recently established intergenerational fund needs to be governed by clear and transparent regulations and required to publish regular, independently audited, financial accounts. 39. Structural reforms are necessary to promote environmentally sustainable private sector growth and to reduce the economy’s vulnerability to shocks.” The RMI can ill afford to place obstacles in the way of private sector investment in addition to those that naturally occur from its small size and distance from major markets. It is essential, therefore, that reforms in the areas of foreign investment, land use, the labor market, and the legal system continue. With regard to foreign investment, the reserved list should be limited in its scope, with sectors included on the list only after the potential losses to industry incumbents have been carefully weighed against the positive benefits that greater competition would bring to the economy. 40. With regard to the financial sector, measures are needed to address current constraints on bank lending and to strengthen the supervisory system. In order for the banking system to play a full role in the development of the economy, factors that currently impede lending, including the difficulties of using land as collateral and of foreclosing, need attention.

Statistical deficiencies and lack of reporting to the Fund continue to impede effective surveillance. Further efforts are needed to improve data collection and dissemination, and to improve reporting to the Fund. 42.

The main assumptions made in the scenarios are: l Agreement is not reached on a new Compact by October 200 1. Therefore, in 200 l/O2 and 2002/03, budgetary financing of $35 million+quivalent to the average of the past 15 years-is received (an increase of $5 million compared to 2000/01). The Compact is then renewed in 2003/04 and differing assumptions are made in the two scenarios as to the size of the financing. l Tax revenues remain constant as a percent of GDP. l The government seeks to maintain usable financial assets of 40 percent of its expenditures as a buffer against unanticipated shocks. l The rate of return on assets in the intergenerational fund is 9 percent per annum; the return on government liquid asset holdings is 6’% percent per annum. l Structural reforms result in a pick-up in growth to 2% percent (in line with the average of other Pacific islands). Inflation is broadly in line with the U.S. at 2% percent. Baseline scenario It is assumed that under the new Compact, the RMI receives annual financing of $30.5 million per annum (the 2000/01 level), but only that part for the military use of Kwajalein Atoll is adjusted for inflation. The U.S. is also assumed to contribute $5 million per annum into the intergenerational fund. When the assets of the intergenerational fund yield sufficient investment income to replace the non-Kwajalein related part of the Compact payments, that part of the Compact financing is assumed to end. In the scenario, a large fiscal surplus is generated during 2001/02-2002/03, despite an increase in capital expenditure from its recently depressed levels, and this allows the authorities to contribute into the intergenerational fund and to rebuild their usable financial assets. The surplus begins to narrow in 2003/04 with the reduction in Compact financing, and a gradual downward adjustment in the expenditure/GDP ratio is required over the medium- term to keep the budget in broad balance and maintain usable financial assets at a comfortable level. This adjustment mainly occurs in current expenditures, which decline by around 7 percent of GDP (to 38 percent of GDP) over the period of the scenario. In 202 l/22, the assets in the intergenerational Iund have reached 120 percent of GDP, and the investment Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - ANNEX I income is sufficient to replace the non-Kwajalein related part of the Compact payments. At that point, that part of the Compact financing ends, and the government begins to use the income from the fund for budgetary purposes. Alternative scenario Payments under the new Compact are assumed to be lower at $28 million per annum, while the U.S. contributes only $2 million per annum into the intergenerational fund. The RMI also contributes $2 million per annum into the fund (assumed to be made from the budget). The more rapid withdrawal of Compact financing and the requirement for the RMI to contribute into the intergenerational fund requires an immediate and larger reduction in government expenditure than in the baseline scenario and fiscal surpluses of 2 percent of GDP per annum are run over the scenario period. Again, the adjustment is concentrated in current expenditure which declines by 9’% percentage points of GDP, to 35 percent of GDP. As in the baseline scenario, the investment income from the assets in the intergenerational fund is sufficient to replace the non-Kwajalein part of the Compact payments in 2021/22 (although, given the lower level of Compact funding in this scenario, the needed accumulation of assets in the intergenerational fund is less than in the baseline scenario).

In 1993, the Bank completed a country economic report, as part of the second Pacific Islands Regional Economic Report. This focused on public sector reform, the role of the private sector in achieving sustainable growth, human resource development, and environmental issues. In May 1993, a grant of $150,000 from the Institutional Development Fund was approved to assist the Presidential Committee on the rationalization of the public service, and a report detailing an action plan for public sector reform was prepared. This report was accepted by the government, and the UNDP assisted in the implementation of the recommendations of the report. In 1994, a regional health study was completed, which provides a comprehensive assessment of issues in the health sector. In 1995, the Bank completed the third Regional Economic Report, which was a thematic report focusing on trade, tourism, fisheries, forestry, and regional cooperation. In 1998, the Bank completed the fourth Regional Economic Report which discussed how the development agenda of governments could be enhanced by focusing on core functions, improving spending patterns, and having in place efficient budgetary processes. ’ Prepared on the basis of the input from the World Bank staff.

The Emergency Typhoon Rehabilitation Assistance and the Fisheries Development projects have been closed. Basic Education Development, Health and Population, and Majuro Water Supply and Sanitation projects are currently being implemented. In January 1997, the AsDB approved a Public Sector Reform Program loan for $12 million to carry out a comprehensive reform program, including the reduction in the size of the civil service, the restructuring of government departments and offices, and the corporation and privatization of public enterprises. The program was supported by a package of technical assistance (TA). The loan was closed with the release of the third tranche in June 2000. In August 1999, the AsDB approved the Ebeye health and infrastructure project including a loan for $9.3 million, to alleviate the problems of water, sanitation, power, and health services in Ebeye. TA grants totaling $14.1 million for 35 TA projects have been approved as of end-October 2000. These comprise both project preparatory and advisory TAs. Project preparatory TAs have focused on fisheries, education, health, water, and sanitation, whereas the advisory TAs have focused on institutional development, policy reforms, and capacity building. The 1995 Pacific Strategy Study has offered the guiding framework for assistance over the medium term, with added emphasis on good governance and positive impact on the beneficiaries. The focus of the country operations is to improve the overall policy environment, reduce the role of the government, promote the private sector, and in the meantime upgrade the capability of human resources by improving the quality of basic services like education, health, and infrastructure. A new Strategy Study is currently under preparation. In addition, the AsDB will host the fourth Consultative Group Meeting in early 2001, which will review economic performance, discuss economic development strategies and policies, share information on donor programs, and reach agreement with the government on significant policy issues, such as good governance. The AsDB is also preparing a new Pacific Island Economic Report for the RMI. ’ Prepared on the basis of input from the AsDB staff.

However, quarterly and monthly statistical data are not published or transmitted to the Fund. Extensive Fund technical assistance has been provided from headquarters and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC), but many recommendations have not been implemented. Real Sector National income accounts have been prepared on a production basis for the years from 1991 onward, although the recommendations of the STA’s August 1992 multisector mission have not been fully incorporated. The Majuro consumer price index, the only available aggregate price index, could be improved through an updating of weights, reclassification of baskets, and larger samples. No unemployment or wage data are available. The last census was conducted in 1999. Government Finance Government finance statistics are regularly compiled for budget control but they are not consolidated into a format usable for analysis. The Ministry of Finance submitted data for publication in the 1997 GFS Yearbook. However, data could not be processed because they do not allow for conversion into the standard GFS format. The authorities received technical assistance on budgetary accounting in 1994. Monetary Accounts A reporting system has been established on the basis of monthly reporting forms and guidelines developed during the 1993 STA mission. Banks report data to the Banking Commissioner. However, monetary data have never been reported to the Fund. Balance of Payments Apart fi-om trade statistics, balance of payments data are not compiled, in spite of past technical assistance in this area. Although efforts are being made to computerize the trade data, problems remain in terms of timeliness and accuracy, mainly due to inappropriate classification and coding. Only limited data are available on services and income, and there are no data on private capital flows. Balance of payments data in this report have been estimated by the Fund staff.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with The Republic of the Marshall Islands On January 5, 2001, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with The Republic of the Marshall Islands.’ Background The economy of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is dependent on United States (U.S.) financing provided through the economic provisions of the Compact of Free Association (the Compact). The economic provisions of the agreement, however, expire in 2001, and negotiations with the U.S. over possible financial assistance after this date have yet to begin. Economic activity is dominated by the public sector, and the private sector has developed largely to meet the demands of the government and its workers. Small contributions also come from agriculture, fisheries, and tourism. In line with the Compact agreement, two stepdowns in U.S. funding have already taken place. Domestic adjustment was postponed following the first stepdown in 1991 by recourse to external commercial borrowing, which was secured against future Compact financing. However, following the second stepdown in 1996, and faced with the debt service burden on existing borrowing, significant domestic adjustment was required. With an independent exchange rate policy precluded by the use of the U.S. dollar, fiscal policy has borne the burden of this adjustment. Under an AsDB-assisted Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP), government expenditure has been reduced significantly since the mid-1990s. ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

Real GDP grew by % percent in 1999/00, following a modest decline in 1998199, as the fiscal stance became more expansionary and the new tuna loining factory began production. After rising by 2 percent in 1998/99, consumer prices are estimated to have declined by 2 percent in 1999/2000 due to the impact of reduction in import duties in August 1999. The fiscal position has deteriorated, with the surplus declining from 15% percent of GDP in 1997198 to an estimated 5% percent of GDP in 1999100. Revenues have fallen sharply due to a decline in external grants and the reduction in the general import duty rate in August 1999. Expenditures exceeded budget in the lead-up to the November 1999 election, while a large (3% percent of GDP) subsidy was paid to the Marshall Islands Social Security Administration (MISSA) during 1999100. The surpluses have not been sufficient to cover the large external debt repayments, and usable government financial assets were virtually exhausted by end-l 999100. Despite a loan from the Development Bank, domestic payment arrears rose to an estimated 1% percent of GDP, and the government imposed a freeze on all non-wage expenditure commitments for the last two weeks of 1999100. Bank lending, which declined sharply during 1995-98, grew by 4% percent (y/y) in June 2000. While business lending has been flat, the stabilization of the economy has underpinned a pick- up in consumer lending and bank deposits, the latter also aided by increased competition among banks to attract time deposits. The current account is estimated to have returned to surplus in 1999/2000, following deficits in the preceding two years. The services deficit narrowed due to the operations of the new tuna factory, while fishing license fees and external grants increased. The trade balance, however, remained in a large deficit. Exports, which have declined sharply since the closure of the domestically-owned fishing company in the mid-1990s remained stagnant, while imports were broadly unchanged. External debt has been reduced substantially, declining from 141 percent of GDP in 1994/95 to 90 percent of GDP in 1999/00. However, the debt servicing ratio remains high at nearly 140 percent of exports of goods and services. The external commercial borrowing contracted by the government in the early 1990s will be paid off by July 2001, resulting in a large decline in outstanding debt and in the debt-service ratio. Thereafter, external debt will mostly comprise concessionary loans. Executive Board Assessment Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public
