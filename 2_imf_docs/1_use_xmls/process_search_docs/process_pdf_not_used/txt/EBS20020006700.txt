Real GDP growth was 4.2 percent in 2001, led by strong export performance (25 percent). Inflation continues to be subdued (1.8 percent), and international reserves have remained stable at US$2.6 billion (7 months of imports). All performance criteria for end-December were observed with ample margins, with the exception of the limit on the overall fiscal deficit. Fiscal performance was in line with the revised target agreed during the November mission (3.7 percent of GDP), but fell short of the performance criterion for end- December because of revenue shortfall. The current account registered a small surplus in 200 1, compared to a programmed deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP. The rate of unemployment, however, remains high (15 percent) and the economy is vulnerable to intensified conflicts in the region which could disrupt the Iraqi oil grant and further reduce other receipts. Against this background, the government launched the Plan for Social and Economic Transformation (PSET) in November 200 1 to reduce unemployment and boost growth through structural reforms and social sector initiatives, entailing an additional spending of up to 4 percent of GDP per year. Macroeconomic policies-The 2002 program targets an acceleration in the real GDP growth rate to 5.1 percent, continued low inflation, and a moderate accumulation of reserves. The overall fiscal deficit is expected to increase moderately to 4.1 percent of GDP, reflecting higher PSET- related spending of JD 150-200 million (2.5-3 percent of GDP). However, because more than half of the deficit will be financed through privatization proceeds and debt swaps (for development expenditure), the fiscal stance will reduce public debt by 5 percentage points in relation to GDP. To achieve the deficit target, in addition to expenditure cuts (2.1 percent of GDP), the authorities will implement the following fiscal measures (with annualized yield of 1.5 percent of GDP): (i) the introduction of GST at 2 percent on all exempted and zero-rated products; (ii) an increase in the administration prices of fuel oil, kerosene, diesel, and LPG; and (iii) liberalization of chaff and barley marketing and elimination of associated subsidies. In order to preserve macroeconomic stability, the PSET projects will be: financed entirely by additional grants and a limited proportion of privatization proceeds; endorsed and prioritized by the World Bank; and fully integrated into the budget beginning 2003. Structural policies-The authorities are developing a strategy on pension reform and its Cabinet approval is expected later in the year. Strong progress has been made in enacting the legislative and administrative reforms aimed at modernizing economic legislation, improving the judicial process, and establishing/strengthening regulatory agencies. The GST administration is being strengthened. The privatization program will be accelerated in 2002 including complete or partial sale of the cement company, Jordan Potash Company, Food Silos Company, and Jordan Telecommunication Company. Progress is continuing on the privatization strategy for the power sector and the related regulatory and tariff regime. Other issue-The authorities have indicated their intention to request a new arrangement (possibly a two-year SBA), once the current EFF expires in May 2002.

The discussion for the 2002 Article IV consultation and fourth and fifth reviews under the extended arrangement were held in Amman from November 4 to 2 1,200 1 and from March 2 to 18, with intervening discussions in Washington during February 4-6. The missions’ conducted policy discussions with the Finance Minister, the Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) and other senior government officials. They also met with the Minister of Planning, the Minister of Labor, the Minister of Water, the Minister of Tourism, and representatives of Social Security Corporation, Jordan Investment Corporation, the Water Authority of Jordan, the Privatization Commission, the Jordanian Chamber of Commerce, commercial banks and other private sector. In their request for completion of the fourth and fifth reviews (Attachment I), the authorities describe economic developments and policy implementation in 2001 and the economic program for 2002. They also seek a waiver for one quantitative performance criterion. 2. The extended arrangement was approved on April 15, 1999, and the third review was completed on August 29,200l. Access under the EFF arrangement is SDR 128 million (75 percent of quota), and as of end-February 2002, SDR 67 million had been drawn. Jordan’s outstanding use of Fund resources at end-February was equivalent to SDR 330 million, or 194 percent of quota (Appendix I). Upon completion of this review, Jordan would be able to purchase SDR 61 million. Jordan has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 in 1997, and the exchange system remains free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The World Bank is supporting structural reforms with a Public Sector Reform Project Loan (PSRL) approved in June 2001 in the amount of US$l20 million (Appendix II). Availability of economic statistics is summarized in Appendix III. The timeliness and coverage of macroeconomic data are generally sufficient for program monitoring. 3. The authorities have indicated that they would like to have a successor arrangement with the Fund, probably a two-year stand-by arrangement, to support the consolidation of macroeconomic stability and the continuation of their reform program. They envisage that this would be an exit arrangement in view of the considerable progress already made toward a strong and sustainable economic position. Much of the economic program, that could be supported by such an arrangement, is outlined in this paper and the accompanying ’ The November 2001 mission comprised Messrs. Mansur (head), Erickson von Allmen and Martin, Ms. Bhattacharya (all MED), Mr. Schneider (PDR), and Mrs. Lansanah-Richardson (MED, Assistant). The March 2002 mission comprised Messrs. Mansur (head), Mongardini, and Kock (MED), Ms. Bhattacharya and Mr. Petri (FAD), and Mr. Schneider (PDR). Mr. Srinivasan (World Bank) participated in part of the March mission. Mr. Burton (MED) joined some of the policy discussions during both missions. Mr. Shalaan (OED) participated in policy discussions during the March mission.

It is envisaged that a mission would visit Jordan after the Board discussions to seek to complete the program discussion. II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 4. Jordan’s macroeconomic performance remains favorable and has been only moderately affected by the global economic slowdown and September 11 related events. Real GDP in 2001 grew by 4.2 percent and growth was fairly broad based. Although tourism has been hard hit both by the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the September 11 events, other sectors of the economy have shown signs of robust growth. Inflation remains low (2.4 percent annual average through February 2002) despite the fuel price adjustment in July 2001. The Amman Stock Exchange index rose by 30 percent in 2001, in part buoyed by the U.S. ratification of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and strong financial performance of the banking sector (Figure 1). Notwithstanding this good growth performance, the rate of unemployment continues to hover around 15 percent (Appendix IV). 5. The fiscal deficit declined significantly but exceeded the program limit because of a revenue shortfall (Figure 2). The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) is estimated to have declined by 1 percentage point to 3.7 percent of GDP; the deficit excluding grants also declined by a similar amount. The improvement in fiscal deficit was attributable to firm actions to hold budgetary expenditures below the program level (by % percent of GDP) despite debt for development swap related outlays (of 0.6 percent of GDP); and an increase in tax and nontax revenues (0.6 percent of GDP) over the preceding year, despite shortfalls relative to targeted levels. The overall fiscal deficit also included debt for development spending of 0.6 percent of GDP, which reduced Jordan’s foreign debt by 1 percent of GDP. The lower deficit and the debt for development operations helped reduce net government and government-guaranteed debt by 2 percentage points to 94 percent of GDP. For the consolidated public sector, the fiscal deficit was about 2.4 percent of GDP, largely because of a continued large surplus of the Social Security Corporation (SSC), and the consolidated public debt was reduced to 59 percent of GDP (Box 1). 6. These positive developments notwithstanding, the overall central government fiscal deficit (excluding grants) was 7.9 percent of GDP, exceeding the program limit by 1.1 percent of GDP (Annex I, Table 2 and 3). Tax and nontax revenues fell short of target by a cumulative 1.6 percent of GDP as a result of teething problems in the extension of the GST to the retail sector; the decline in tourism activity due to the September 11 events and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict; and the temporary tax relief provided to the hotel and travel industries. Nontax revenues suffered from low international prices for phosphate and potash, which affected transfers to the budget from the mining corporations. Postponement of investments by foreign investors in the aftermath of September 11 also led to loss of royalties and fees. The authorities and the staff realized that, given the extent of revenue shortfall through October, achieving the deficit target for 2001 would not be feasible even with sizable expenditure cuts, and accordingly revised the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) target in November to a realistically attainable level of 7.9 percent of GDP. In light of these uncertainties, it was decided to defer completion of the fourth review until end-December Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- Figure 1.

Jordan-Consolidated Public Sector Operations and Debt While the central government dominates the Jordanian public sector, the operations of other institutions are important both macroeconomically and in the provision of public services.’ It is noteworthy that the consolidated public sector deficit is significantly lower than the central government’s, This is also reflected in a significantly lower debt for the consolidated public sector (59 percent of GDP) relative to the central government debt (94 percent of GDP). This has and continues to be an important factor in maintaining macroeconomic stability. The own-budget agencies have their budgets approved by Cabinet. They include some which provide public services and transfers-notably the National Aid Fund, and others with regulatory responsibilities, such as the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC). Still others, such as the Ports Corporation, are primarily engaged in commercial activities. The number of autonomous agencies was 27 in 200 1 and increased to 3 1 in 2002. Most own-budget agencies break about even after receipt of transfers from the central government. The Jordan Investment Corporation enjoys a steady stream of investment income, but is in the process of liquidating its portfolio through privatization. The Ports Corporation and TRC also make profits, which are transferred to the budget. The Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) is by far the largest autonomous agency, and the only one to undertake significant infrastructure investment and to generate a deficit on its operations. In the aggregate, the autonomous agencies typically run a modest deficit, which is expected to recur in 2002. The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) earns seigniorage revenues, and interest on its foreign exchange reserves, but pays interest on certain liabilities, most importantly the large volume of CDs it has issued to absorb liquidity. The CBJ has been profitable since 2000, and is expected to generate a small operating surplus in 2002. The Social Security Corporation (SSC) is an autonomous agency charged with providing old-age and disability pensions to private sector workers and civil servants hired afier 1995. The SSC receives considerable income from contributions (including from government) and earnings on its considerable investments. The latter amounted to JD 1.6 billion (25 percent of GDP) on a net basis at end-2001. The SSC’s cash surplus has been running at about 2 percent of GDP per year, and is expected to remain positive for at least another two decades due to the large number of relatively young contributors and small number of retirees at present.

In the event, the revised target was achieved because, in line with the revised fiscal target, tax administration (mostly anti-smuggling measures) was strengthened substantially and budgetary expenditure was contained below the program level. The composition of expenditure also improved in 2001. Spending on capital investment increased by 0.4 percent of GDP relative to 2000, while current expenditures decreased by 0.3 percent of GDP. Within current expenditures, the wage bill was held constant in relation to GDP, while military spending was reduced. In addition, interest savings in the amount of 0.8 percent of GDP-n account of lower interest rates on both domestic and foreign debt and the depreciation of the Japanese yen vis-a-vis the Jordan dinar-helped finance the increase in transfers for pensions, social programs and municipalities. 7. Monetary policy continues to support the fixed exchange rate anchor (Figure 3). Net usable international reserves of the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) remained comfortably high at US$2.56 billion at end-2001, equivalent to about 7 months of imports or over 100 percent of Jordanian dinar (JD) reserve money. In the first three months of 2002, foreign exchange reserves rose by US$l85 million to US$2.75 billion.

Credit to the private sector surged by 11.3 percent, reflecting higher export and construction activities and strong demand for consumer credit. The slight decline in reserve money reflected the increasing use of ATM and credit cards. Interest rates on three-month CBJ certificates of deposit (CDs) fell by 2 percentage points in 2001, somewhat in line with U.S. Treasury bill rates, and stood at 3.9 percent at end-March. 8. Jordanian banks have remained well capitalized and the banking system appears to be generally sound. As of end-June 2001, capital and reserves accounted for 6% percent of commercial banks’ assets. The average capital adequacy ratio at 18.3 percent was well above the mandated level of 12 percent and the level of provisioning remains stable at 35 percent of classified loans, despite the shortening of the classification period.2 However, in early February, three small banks were hit by an incidence of fraud affecting about JD 60-80 million in loans (0.5 percent of total commercial banks’ assets).3 The extent of losses to the banks could however be substantially smaller as collateral and guarantees are recovered through the ongoing judicial process. ; The external current account registered a small surplus in 2001. Domestic export i.e., exports excluding re-exports) growth, especially from the Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZ), was unexpectedly strong, exceeding 25 percent, with nontraditional exports (manufactures, textiles, and apparel) faring particularly well (Appendix V). Imports grew moderately (5.4 percent), following a sharp increase in 2000, and also reflecting a deceleration in the growth of re-exports to regional countries. The decline in tourism receipts (3.2 percent) was relatively moderate as arrival of tourists from the neighboring Gulf countries largely compensated for the sharp drop in tourists from outside the region. The shortfall in tourism receipts was partly offset by strong inflows of remittances. As a result, the external current account recorded a modest surplus (0.4 percent of GDP) in 2001, compared to a deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP envisaged under the program.4 2 Classified loans have increased as a result of the reduction in the period for classifying doubtful loans from 180 days in 1999, to 150 days in 2000, to 120 days in 2001, and to 90 days in 2002. 3 The bank fraud case was first revealed on February 4,2002. The three banks involved extended large amount of loans to the owner of a computer company, who then fled the country. The fraud involved the production of fake invoices for computer equipment contracts that were used as collateral to secure additional loans. The state security prosecutor has ordered the sequestration of funds belonging to 55 people and companies suspected of involvement in the fraud and prevented the individuals from leaving the country. 4 The current account surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2000 was attributable to a large UN compensation payout, accounting for 6.3 percent of GDP.

The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, which came into effect in December 2001, boosted the outlook for exports. The FTA provides for the elimination of all bilateral tariff and other trade restrictions over a 1 O-year period. The association agreement with the EU is likely to be ratified in the second half of 2002. In line with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 6 percent in 2001 (Figure 4). However, Jordan’s recent export performance, despite the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate over the last three years, suggests that the authorities’ efforts to liberalize trade and secure preferential access to key markets have significantly improved Jordan’s competitiveness.5 11. Progress in structural reform has been solid. A consortium has been selected to build and operate a power plant as Jordan’s first independent power producer, and consultants have been selected to advise on the privatization of the electricity generation and distribution companies. The duty free and catering subsidiaries of the Royal Jordanian (RJ) airline were sold last year. In addition, the Jordan Investment Corporation (JIC) has sold four small companies. The terms of sale of the remaining shares of the cement company have also been finalized and the sale could be concluded shortly. Discussions are continuing on the sale of RJ’s remaining noncore operations, but the privatization of the airline itself had to be postponed as a result of the current difficult environment for the airline industry. Preparation and presentation to Cabinet of a strategy for reform of the public pension system, a structural benchmark for end-December 2001 (Annex I, Table 5), had to be postponed partially due to a delay in providing technical assistance from FAD in the aftermath of September 11. The FAD expert on pension reform is currently in Jordan assisting the authorities in preparing a reform strategy. In the meantime, the Cabinet decided in January 2002 to enroll all new military personnel in the Social Security Corporation (SSC) as part of a contributory pension plan. 12. In mid-November, on the initiative of King Abdullah, the government launched the Plan for Social and Economic Transformation (PSET) (Box 2). The PSET recognizes that Jordan’s overall macroeconomic performance has improved in recent years, as a result of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform. However, real GDP growth of about 5 This improvement has occurred despite a significant terms-of-trade deterioration over the last three years. In addition, there are no signs of labor market pressure.

Jordan-The Plan for Social and Economic Transformation On November 15,2001, His Majesty King Abdullah II announced on behalf of the government a five-year Plan for Social and Economic Transformation (PSET) with the objective to stimulate private investment and strengthen economic growth and employment creation. The six main components of the PSET are: structural reforms, accelerated privatization and a private sector-led investment program, human resource development, rural development, improvements in health care, and poverty alleviation. The legislative reform agenda under the PSET includes 20 new laws, 10 new regulations, and amendments to 23 existing laws and 9 regulations. The laws and regulations to be amended or enacted include the securities law, the companies’ law, the income tax law, the investment law, pension reforms and civil service regulations. The pension reform endorsed in the PSET will be developed on the basis of technical assistance currently being provided by the Fund. The authorities will also establish various regulatory authorities (e.g., in power, post and telecommunication, and transport). The judicial reforms include: hiring ofjudges and lawyers; installing IT systems in courts and publishing all court decisions on the intemet; establishing performance standards for judges and supporting administrative personnel; enacting a new code of ethics for lawyers; and developing a court management system. Judicial and administrative reforms are also being supported by the World Bank under its Public Sector Reform Loan. Administrative reforms include: implementation of performance-based budgeting and resource planning; outsourcing management and implementation of certain services and functions; and allowing flexibility in hiring. With respect to privatization, the PSET includes, for the next 3-4 years, most public enterprises with a total estimated value of about JD 1 billion. The major privatizations are: the remaining 50 percent shares of Jordan Telecommunication Corporation; the remaining 52 percent of the Arab Potash Company; power sector generation and distribution companies; remaining shares of Jordan Cement Company; and the remaining holdings of the Jordan Investment Corporation. In parallel, the government is negotiating private sector participation (BOT basis) in a large number of investment projects, including the gas pipeline, water distribution, electricity generation by independent power producers and several other mid-size projects that could amount to more than JD 1 billion in total investment over the next 34 years. The PSET’s human resource development program amounts to JD 250-275 million (about 4 percent of GDP) per year. Strengthened general education and skill development through vocational training programs constitutes the core of the PSET, accounting for JD 116 million in spending. The largest part of this is intended to strengthen general education, including JD 60 million to the Ministry of Education “to enable it to implement its new strategic policies.” The PSET also includes improvement in teachers’ qualification, a new evaluation system, revised curriculum, and the introduction of one year of kindergarten before the regular schooling. The rural development program (JD 118 million) is mostly accounted for by the Think Big Campaign (JD 63 million), which would provide start up loans to 1,200 SMEs in rural areas, and the construction of roads (JD 25 million). In the health care area (JD 41 million), the focus is on improving the quality of human and material resources through training and upgrading of equipment. The PSET’s allocation for social spending and poverty alleviation is JD 28 million in 2002. The majority of this allocation would go toward the creation of a supplemental income support scheme to bridge the gap between family income and the accepted poverty line. The program is expected to cost about JD 100 million annually if fully implemented. For 2002, the authorities have decided to scale back the size of PSET spending to JD 150-200 million, in view of the implementation capacity constraints and the delays in securing the needed financing. The government is working closely with the World Bank to prioritize its social sector program and evaluate implementation capacity. At the request of the government, the World Bank is also identifying four technical experts to assist in the areas of education, health, vocational training and public sector reforms, and in capacity building of the relevant implementation agencies.

The human resource, health and rural development components of the PSET are to be supported by an expenditure package amounting up to JD 275 million (about 4 percent of GDP) per year, which is on top of relatively large allocations for social sector programs in the regular budget. The authorities intend to finance the PSET through additional grants and a limited proportion of privatization proceeds to ensure that it is consistent with their medium-term fiscal strategy, which aims to substantially further reduce the public debt burden (see below and Annex II). The World Bank’s preliminary assessment, stated in an official letter to the authorities in March 2002, is that the PSET will assist poverty alleviation efforts, improve government services, and generate employment. 13. The 2002 budget announced in January aims at reducing the fiscal deficit (excluding grants and spending associated with the PSET) by 1 percentage point to 6.9 percent of GDP, consistent with the understanding reached with the November mission. The deficit, including grants and excluding the PSET, is budgeted to fall to 3.5 percent of GDP. The budget assumption for revenue (growing at 12 percent) appeared to be somewhat optimistic, given the outlook for nominal GDP growth. The authorities also did not announce any new revenue measure at the time of the budget announcement. Furthermore, although expenditure cuts of 1 percent of GDP were announced in the budget speech, the cuts were not identified. The budget also includes (in Chapter II of the budget) expenditure programs of JD 275 million (4 percent of GDP) associated with the PSET, which are to be executed subject to availability of additional grants and privatization proceeds. As discussed below, however, spending under the PSET in 2002 is expected to be significantly lower than envisaged in the budget. III. DISCUSSIONS ON THE PROGRAM FOR 2002 Macroeconomic framework 14. The macroeconomic objectives for 2002 are to sustain economic growth in the face of a difficult regional situation, maintain price stability, preserve international reserves at a comfortable level, and achieve a further reduction in net public debt consistent with the medium-term fiscal strategy. Continued strong export performance together with the 6 In 2002-l 0, Jordan’s working age population is projected to expand by about 2.9 percent a year, and with a modest increase in the average labor force participation rate, the labor force would grow by 3.6 percent a year. With a target of reducing the unemployment rate from around 14 percent currently to 6 percent by 2010, employment would have to grow by about 4.8 percent a year. To achieve this growth in employment, while allowing real wages to increase by 1 percent a year, would require real GDP growth of just about 6 percent a year.

CPI inflation, which was less than 2 percent in 2001, is expected to be 3.5 percent, reflecting adjustments in the prices of petroleum products and the expansion of the GST base (see below). Excluding the one-time effect resulting from changes in administered prices, the core inflation would still be less than 2 percent. Net usable international reserves are targeted to be US$2.7 billion entailing an increase of US$l58 million in 2002. Reduction in public debt in relation to GDP would be sustained through containment of the fiscal deficit and utilization of privatization proceeds largely for the purpose of debt reduction. 15. The balance of payments is expected to remain comfortable in 2002, although the current account is projected to shift into a small deficit. Merchandise exports, particularly manufactures, textiles, and apparel from the QIZs, are expected to show continued strong growth, albeit at a more moderate pace than seen in 2001. Imports are projected to accelerate in line with implementation of the PSET and higher GDP growth. Key elements of the services balance are expected to record little or only moderate growth compared to 2001. Given the escalating level of regional tension, travel receipts are projected to show zero growth during 2002. Inward remittances are expected to grow at a substantially lower rate than in 2001, reflecting slower economic activity in the region. The resulting current account deficit (equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP), combined with the end of exceptional financing from the last round of Paris Club rescheduling and the need to maintain a comfortable reserve position, is expected to generate a moderate financing gap of about US$210 million. 16. Continued structural reform, building on the considerable progress over the past 3 years under the current extended arrangement, is also a central element of the program. The main focus of reform in 2002 will be on the pension system; legislative and legal reforms; power sector reforms paving the way for privatization of power sector entities and private investment in the sector; liberalization of animal feed marketing; and improved tax administration. Fiscal policy 17. The consolidated central government fiscal deficit (including grants and the expenditure associated with the PSET) would be limited to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2002. This target would entail an adjustment in the core (non-PSET) budget deficit (excluding grants) of 1 percent of GDP. The consolidated fiscal deficit (including grants and the PSET) would show a modest increase of 0.4 percent of GDP over the 2001 outturn due to PSET Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- Box 3. Jordan-Macroeconomic Effects of the PSET Key assumptions: This assessment of the macroeconomic effects of the PSET assumes that the Plan is fully implemented, implying additional government spending of JD 200 million in 2002; JD 250-275 million a year in 2003-06 and falling thereafter to JD 150 million per year reflecting the permanent increase in recurrent expenditures, Based on a preliminary review of the Plan, 40 percent of the government spending is assumed to be investment. The Plan is assumed to be fully financed through grants and a limited portion of future privatization proceeds, Given implementation capacity constraints and the delay in securing financing, the plan could be delayed or trimmed down, implying somewhat lower growth rates, particularly for 2002 and 2003. Private investment is assumed to increase, initially reflecting the private sector-led infrastructure investments and, thereafter, the endogenous response to the various structural reforms and higher economic growth. Private investment is assumed to increase gradually from 20 percent of GDP in 2001 to 22 percent of GDP in 2007, compared with 20% percent under the baseline. The increased private sector investment is attributable to an ambitious privatization program to be implemented at an accelerated pace, and the launching of a campaign for implementing a number of larger private sector-led infrastructure projects in the water, gas, and power sectors. In addition, it is assumed that the various reforms under the PSET would give rise to a modest reduction in the incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR) over the long-term, from 5.8 in 2002 to 4.3 in 2007 (compared with 4.5 in the baseline scenario). The addition to output coming from the reduction in the ICOR is assumed to translate into higher private consumption. Macroeconomic effects: During the period 2002-04, the most important effect would be a sharp rise in domestic demand from higher public consumption and investment, leading to faster real GDP growth and a moderate widening of the current account deficit in the outer years. The effects are dampened by the high degree of openness. I/ Real GDP growth would still jump from 4.2 percent in 2001 to 6 percent in 2003 (compared with 4.5 percent in the baseline scenario) and would then gradually decelerate to 5.6 percent in 2007 as the demand induced expansionary impact of the Plan diminishes. The current account deficit (including grants) would initially improve from the additional grants associated with the PSET. However, as grants associated with the PSET are assumed to virtually disappear after 2006, the current account deficit would stabilize at 1.2 percent of GDP by 2005. In terms of savings and investment imbalances, the somewhat larger current account deficit reflects mainly higher public and private investment, whereas public savings rise as a percentage of GDP and private savings are relatively stable. Imports are boosted by the strong domestic demand and high import propensity. The larger current account deficit would be financed by foreign direct investment (mainly privatization receipts and investments in the infrastructure projects) and other capital inflows associated with the financing of private investments.

Furthermore, as half of the fiscal deficit is envisaged to be financed through privatization proceeds, the stance of fiscal policy will contribute to a substantial reduction in the debt/GDP ratio. The recourse to domestic financing would be limited to 0.1 percent of GDP, allowing for a substantial increase in credit to the private sector. Because the government remains committed to relying solely on the issue of treasury bills through regular and competitive tenders, no financing from the CBJ is envisaged. 18. In order to limit the fiscal deficit to the program level, the authorities have put together a package of revenue measures, yielding JD 95 million (1.4 percent of GDP) on an annualized basis. The revenue package to be implemented by May 1,2002 includes: (i) increasing the price of fuel oil, kerosene, diesel and LPG by a weighted average of 10 percent (0.5 percent of GDP);7 (ii) extending the GST at a rate of 2 percent to all previously exempt and zero-rated products (0.4 percent of GDP); (iii) limiting the reduction of the tariff rate on industrial inputs to 3 percent (instead of complete elimination as proposed in the budget), which would limit the revenue loss to JD 16 million, compared with JD 27 million envisaged in the budget; (iv) raising the price of animal feed to market levels and liberalizing the market for these products (as discussed in the MEFP). The authorities proposed these measures as prior actions under the program to safeguard the fiscal deficit target for 2002. In addition, the authorities expect to obtain advance income tax payments from banks (JD 10 million) as in 2001. The authorities are also committed to increasing the price of bread gradually at an appropriate time in order to liberalize the wheat and bread markets. Efforts are also underway to strengthen GST administration along the lines recommended by the recent FAD technical assistance mission. 19. The authorities will also cut expenditures from their budgeted levels by 2.1 percent of GDP while increasing allocations to ameliorate the impact of price increases on the poor. Most of the cuts (1.5 percent of GDP) will be in the capital budget, which is traditionally set on the high side, but the envisaged capital spending would still allow for healthy growth in real terms. As in the past, the stipulated expenditure cuts will be enforced by the Ministry of Finance through limits on expenditure authorizations throughout the year. Notwithstanding the cuts, the program allows for increasing the monthly allowances for public employees and pensioners by JD 5 per month in order to compensate them for the above-mentioned price adjustments. In addition, the government will increase cash transfers to the poor (0.4 percent of GDP) by broadening the coverage of the income transfer program and introducing a supplementary cash transfer program. The authorities have also decided to limit PSET-related expenditure to about JD 200 million (3 percent of GDP), compared with JD 275 million (4 percent of GDP) envisaged in the budget, because of delays in securing financing from bilateral donors and the need to ensure implementation quality. Including 7 The price increases for kerosene and diesel will become effective by June 1,2002, but the cabinet decision in this regard will be taken by May 1,2002.

The PSET will be financed exclusively through non-debt-creating flows. The authorities are working under the assumption that they would be able to secure multi-year commitment to finance the PSET, utilizing additional grants of JD 160 million in 2002 for this purpose. So far, the authorities have received preliminary commitments of US$250 million (JD 175 million) comprising: US$lOO million from the U.S. (as reflected in the 2003 U.S. budget beginning October 1,2002) as well as an additional commitment of US$lOO million as part of the U.S. supplementary budget appropriations for 2002; US$27 million from the EU; and certain unspecified amounts from Arab countries. They are also hopeful about additional support from other bilateral sources in the form of grants and debt swaps. For 2002, the authorities will use foreign grants and a limited portion (30 percent) of privatization proceeds to finance the PSET. The acceleration and wider scope of the privatization program under the PSET will ensure that the authorities’ debt reduction strategy is achieved in 2002 and over the medium-term, even after using a limited portion of privatization proceeds to finance the deficit. The authorities underscored that projects would be initiated only when a sufficient amount of the financing was secured. The Bank will assist the authorities in prioritizing the projects in the context of sector strategies and resource constraints, and will also identify four technical experts to assist the government in capacity building and project implementation in education, health, vocational training and public sector reform areas. For reasons of expenditure control and management, the PSET spending will be managed by the Ministry of Finance through its normal procedures and treasury system, and it will be fully integrated with the budget starting in 2003, in line with best budgetary practices. Monetary and exchange rate policies 21. Monetary policy will continue to support the exchange rate peg. The authorities, while continuing to be aware of the arguments for greater flexibility, believe that the current peg to the U.S. dollar has served Jordan well in the last decade by bringing inflation down to industrial country levels and fostering confidence in the Jordanian dinar. The surge in export growth in 2001 provides some assurances that, despite the real exchange rate appreciation over the last decade, competitiveness is not an immediate concern. The mission emphasized that, maintaining high levels of reserves and a strong resolve to protect them through active interest policy would be essential for continued macroeconomic stability. The staff also suggested that exchange rate policy should be kept under review in light of developments in competitiveness and the balance of payments. 22. The monetary program for 2002 is consistent with the authorities’ exchange rate policy, while allowing for healthy growth in private sector credit. Broad money is expected to grow by 10 percent, somewhat higher than nominal GDP of 8.3 percent, reflecting recent trends in further financial deepening. A modest reversal of last year’s Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - increase in the share of foreign currency to total deposits would imply a somewhat higher growth of JD broad money (10.6 percent).8 Reserve money is expected to grow broadly in line with broad money. The authorities are targeting a moderate accumulation of NFA during the year and the NDA of the CBJ will be sufficiently limited to achieve the targeted international reserve position. 23. The authorities are strengthening banking regulations in line with the new banking law passed in August 2000. Starting in January 2002, the CBJ has brought its loan classification in line with Basle core standards by reducing the period for classifying doubtful loans from 120 days to 90 days. In addition, it will shortly be issuing regulations and guidelines: (i) strengthening the penalties for violations of central bank regulations; (ii) limiting the total holding of shares by banks; and (iii) strengthening guidelines on banks’ internal control systems. These new regulations, together with the fine-tuning of the risk- weighted capital adequacy calculations and the increase in frequency and effectiveness of on- site supervision, should also reduce the risk of a reoccurrence of bank fraud. The authorities categorically stated that no public money would be used to bail out the banks affected by the recent fraud; the loss after settlement of collaterals and guarantees would be covered by the affected banks including capital injections, as needed. They also indicated that after the settlement of the recent fraud case, they would consider participating in an FSAP exercise. Structural policies 24. Many of the fiscal measures to be implemented by end-April have strong structural elements and would reduce distortions in the economy and stimulate growth. The liberalization of animal feed will allow the private sector to provide these products freely and more efficiently. The ongoing tariff and other trade liberalization initiatives will provide stimulus to the domestic economy by increasing market access and improved resource allocation (Box 4). The proposed increase in petroleum prices targets products which are sold at below international market prices, and should improve the relative price structure. The authorities intend to bring prices of all petroleum products to at least cost recovery in the near term. Moreover, they will review domestic prices of petroleum products quarterly in order to protect the associated revenues in the budget. The authorities recognize that a system of petroleum taxation based on specific excises and GST would protect the budget from variations in the international price of oil, but they feel that an opportune moment for the transition to such a system must be found. 25. The authorities are in the process of developing a strategy on pension reform and strengthening GST administration with FAD technical assistance. The authorities are aware that pension payments are the fastest growing expenditure item in the budget and, ’ The increase in foreign currency deposits in 2001 was partly related to currency substitution associated with unfounded rumors of a possible devaluation, which is expected to be partly reversed in 2002.

Jordan-Trade Policy Developments and Issues Jordan has made significant progress in trade liberalization since the late 1980s. Successive rounds of tariff reductions, catalyzed by accession to the WTO, have reduced average tariffs from 21 percent in 1988 to just under 15 percent in 200 1, one of the lowest in the region (Figure l), and the maximum tariff from 3 18 percent to 30 percent. The number of tariff rates was also reduced to five, which lowered tariff dispersion. Simple Average Tariff Rates (Latest Available Data) Most quantitative restrictions and import bans were converted to tariffs and subsequently liberalized, and a number of customs exemptions were reduced, eliminated, or scheduled for later termination. Jordan will continue to liberalize its tariff regime in line with commitments to the WTO. By the year 2010, the maximum bound rate for most tariff lines will be 20 percent. Jordan will also continue to implement domestic legislation related to obligations under such WTO agreements as Trade- related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), Customs Valuation, Import Licensing Procedures, Technical Barriers to Trade, and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. In addition to implementing WTO obligations, Jordan has increasingly looked to regional and bilateral agreements to secure a more liberal trade regime and to boost market access. An association agreement with the European Union was signed in 1997, and will likely be implemented by the middle of this year. Jordan has also successfully negotiated a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States. The FTA came into effect in December 2001 and will involve phased elimination of all tariffs over the next ten years. A new FTA with Syria, replacing a 1975 accord, was signed in October 2001 and will be implemented this year. Jordan also has standing bilateral trade agreements with Israel, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and is a member of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA). Jordan has also benefited from the establishment of Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZstindustrial parks with duty and quota-free access to the U.S. market. Recent data suggest that the QIZ scheme has contributed to the rapid growth of exports to the U.S. Some 64 percent of all Jordanian exports entered the US duty free under the QIZ program in 200 1. In addition to QIZs, the Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ) was established in early 2001, allowing for duty- and quota-free trade, and a reduced rate of the VAT. These and other special arrangements provide some explanation for Jordan’s substantial export growth in the last few years despite real exchange rate appreciation and declining terms of trade. Despite progressive waves of liberalization and the substantial legislative and regulatory changes implemented as part of WTO accession, Jordan’s trade regime is still moderately restrictive. Jordan is currently rated a 5 out of 10 on the IMF’s trade policy restrictiveness index-falling about halfway between the most open economies in the region and some of the more restrictive. A substantial share of total trade remains subject to nontariff barriers in the form of import licensing, prior approvals, or exclusive import rights granted to state enterprises-some of which will be phased out in coming years. In particular, the government maintains an exclusive license for crude oil imports in order to ensure that the Iraqi oil grant is transferred to the budget. Removal of such exclusive trading rights could substantially lower Jordan’s rating on the trade restrictiveness index. Further, rationalization of commitments made under bilateral agreements would simplify customs administration. The agenda for trade policy over the medium term is largely dictated by the commitments made under the WTO accession agreement and the various bilateral trade accords. However, this does not rule out the possibility of more aggressive, unilateral trade liberalization, preferably on a most favored nation (MFN) basis. Most recently, for example, the authorities announced the elimination of tariffs on a wide range of industrial inputs over the next few years. Given the relatively high share of trade taxes in total fiscal revenue, the revenue implications of recent and mture changes to Jordan’s trade regime will be a key consideration.

As a first step toward reforming the military pension system, which accounts for 3/4 of government pensions, the government has decided to enroll all new military recruits in the Social Security Corporation. The latter administers a partially funded defined benefit plan in which most other Jordanian private and public sector employees hired since 1996 participate.’ Cabinet approval of a pension reform strategy is expected later in the year. In order to improve GST administration, the GST department has modified its own action plan for 2002 and accelerated its implementation, along the lines recommended by a recent FAD technical assistance mission. The extension of a 2 percent GST rate on previously exempted and zero-rated products may help reduce the administrative burden on the GST department. The authorities indicated that the imposition of the GST on exempt and zero-rated products at the rate of 2 percent should be seen as a first step toward raising the GST rate on essential products eventually to a respectable level of perhaps 5 percent. 26. Strong progress was made since late 2001 in enacting the legislative and administrative reforms under the PSET. As discussed in Box 2, these reforms aim at modernizing economic legislation, improving the judicial process, and establishing/strengthening regulatory agencies. In the area of economic legislation, the labor law was amended to delineate the intellectual property rights of employers and employees. Legislation was modified to improve the transparency of the bankruptcy procedure. Moreover, laws are being introduced to encourage and regulate: leasing activities; electronic commerce; establishment of mutual funds (which did not have a legal status under the previous law); operations of cross-border stock exchanges; privatization of stock exchanges; strengthening disclosure requirements and enforcement; and private partnership companies and stock options (by amending the companies law). In the area of judicial reform, various laws were amended to increase the expediency of the judicial process. In the area of regulatory reforms, legislation was passed to strengthen the Securities Commission and the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, and to establish a Food and Drug Administration Authority. 27. The privatization program will be accelerated in 2002. The authorities are in the process of completing the privatization of the cement company. They also plan to sell a part of the Jordan Potash Company and the Food Silos Company to strategic investors, and a portion of the government’s share in Jordan’s Telecommunication Company through the stock market. As regards the power sector, the government has separated the activities of the generation, transmission, and distribution companies created in 1999; and established an effective regulatory body for the industry. The regulatory and tariff regimes for the electricity sector will be approved by the government in the second half of the year. With the completion of these steps, the stage will be set for privatizing the generation and distribution 9 The SSC will likely accumulate assets for another 20 years, but would probably need some reform over the coming years to achieve long-term actuarial sustainability.

The authorities will also continue to hold discussions with interested parties on a strategic alliance for Royal Jordanian and its eventual privatization, which had been put on hold in the aftermath of the September 11 events. 28. Jordan’s macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate to conduct surveillance. Jordan participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and meets the recommendations for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of most data categories. A ROSC data module mission visited Amman in early 2002 and identified some shortcomings in statistical practices and databases, particularly in the balance of payments, that have the potential for detracting from the accurate and timely analysis of economic and financial developments. However, with an appropriate increase in resources, further technical assistance, and changes in statistical practices, Jordan should be able to meet the requirements for the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) within two to three years. The authorities have endorsed the recommendation of the ROSC data module mission and expressed their commitment to develop an action plan with a view to meeting the Fund’s SDDS requirements in the next two to three years. IV. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND CAPACITY TO REPAY THE FUND 29. Notwithstanding the difficult regional situation, Jordan’s medium-term growth outlook remains positive. The successful reforms initiated under the current arrangement, together with trade liberalization and increased market access, appear to have set the stage for strong export-led growth over the medium-term. Export growth is expected to continue at about 8-10 percent per year, spurred by the FTA with the United States and the forthcoming Association Agreement with the EU. Large private sector-led infrastructure projects, including in water, gas, and electricity generation, are likely to boost investment. Moreover, additional spending under the PSET is likely to boost growth in 2002-03, while the PSET- related structural reforms, enhancement of health and educational standards, and poverty alleviation are likely to have a positive supply side impact on growth over the long term. Overall, growth is expected to peak at around 6 percent in 2003, and then decrease moderately as the fiscal impulse associated with PSET spending disappears with the level of PSET spending peaking in 2003 and growth would stabilize at around 5X-6 percent over 2004-07. At the same time, inflation is likely to remain stable at about 2 percent per year. 30. The authorities’ medium-term liscal strategy aims at reducing the public debt ratio substantially over the medium term (Annex II). The authorities envisage a reduction in the fiscal deficit (including grants) to about 2l% percent of GDP by 2007, even after allowing for a steady reduction in foreign grants. This will, however, involve a major and sustained effort given the entrenched structural rigidities in both the revenue and expenditure side. Policy reforms aimed at improving elasticity of the tax system and rationalizing nontax revenues would be crucial. Tax administration reform would also play a central role for revenue mobilization. Reduction in current outlays by about 4 percentage points of GDP would require pension reform, limiting the size of the public sector wage bill and spending on goods and services. The commitment to finance PSET-related spending with grants and a limited proportion of privatization proceeds would substantially contain the financing of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - deficit through debt. In particular, the use of a large proportion of privatization proceeds for debt reduction and gains from debt swap operations would help reduce government debt substantially. Accordingly, total government and government-guaranteed net debt is targeted to be reduced by about 30 percentage points to less than 65 percent by 2007. This lower debt burden would reduce the interest bill by 0.7 percentage points to 3.6 percent of GDP, therefore releasing significant resources for priority spending. In the event of a significant shortfall or delay in privatization proceeds, the fiscal adjustment path would need to be made more ambitious in line with the agreed debt strategy. This issue would be addressed in the context of the successor arrangement. 31. The external current account is envisaged to stabilize at a sustainable deficit level of about 1 percent of GDP over the medium term. Imports are projected to rise in line with increased private investment and spending under the PSET, but the impact would be largely offset by additional grants and inflows of foreign direct investment associated with the government’s ambitious privatization agenda. The projected level of the external current account balance, combined with the end of debt relief under the last Paris Club rescheduling and lower net borrowing is projected to result in financing gaps. In line with the reduction of total public debt, Jordan’s government and government-guaranteed external debt is projected to decline by more then 25 percentage points to about 50 percent of GDP by 2007 (Table 7). Debt service on external debt should also remain manageable, declining from 20 percent of exports of goods and services in 2001 to about 16 percent by 2007. 32. There are considerable downside risks to the medium-term outlook, arising from a possible military action against Iraq or, to a lesser extent, from a significant shift in the exchange rate between major currencies. A preliminary staff analysis on the impact of a military action against Iraq that was shared with the authorities shows a substantial loss of fiscal grants (4% percent of GDP yearly) and a widening of the current account deficit to about 4% percent of GDP over the medium-term, arising also from the disruption of trade with Iraq and tourism from third countries. Consequently, and in the absence of a policy response, the fiscal and external current account deficits would be unsustainable and- together with capital flight and increased dollarization-the resulting uncertainties could lead to substantially lower growth, averaging 3 percent over the medium-term, and a significant drain on international reserves. However, appropriate policy measures, particularly in the form of substantial increases in domestic petroleum prices, and additional support from the international community could reduce the impact of the military action against Iraq. The authorities would, however, need to address the erosion in competitiveness arising from the higher domestic cost structure, in the event the loss of the Iraqi oil grant were permanent and domestic petroleum prices are adjusted to market levels. In a separate scenario, a 20 percent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the yen and the euro would initially increase the government and government-guaranteed debt ratio by as much as 9 percent of GDP, without a significant impact on the current account. However, this potential adverse impact, although sizable, would not fundamentally change the debt dynamics but would prolong the adjustment process by an additional l-2 years.

Obligations to the Fund comprise only a small share of Jordan’s total external debt service (Table 10). Assuming that the remaining purchase under the current extended arrangement is made, outstanding Fund credit would increase to 203 percent of quota in 2002, accounting for about 6 percent of Jordan’s government and government-guaranteed external debt. Debt service obligations to the Fund are projected to peak at 2.3 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services in 2003, when they would account for 11 percent of total external debt service obligations. V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 34. Jordan’s economic performance in the final year of the program-marked by healthy economic growth and improved macroeconomic indicators-generally exceeded program objectives for 2001 and for the extended arrangement. Broad-based real GDP growth allowed for an increase in per capita income for two successive years for the first time in many years; inflation remained low; public debt remained firmly on a declining trend; and international reserves were maintained at a comfortable level. Furthermore, these gains were made in a very difficult external and regional economic and security environment, which impeded trade with regional countries and led to a drop in tourism-related activities and postponement of numerous investment projects. The impressive macroeconomic performance reflected private sector confidence in Jordan’s prudent macroeconomic policies, sustained progress in structural reforms and opening of markets for exports, enabling Jordan to attract foreign investment and register a record growth in domestic exports. 35. Progress in fiscal consolidation and reduction of public debt in 2001 was respectable despite the slippage in fiscal deficit leading to the breach of the performance criterion. The revenue shortfall emerged in the second half of the fiscal year and was accentuated by developments in the aftermath of September 11. Nevertheless, the authorities were successful in realizing the revised fiscal target established in consultation with the staff in November. They acted promptly and demonstrated their ability to contain expenditure well below the program assumption, but could not fully offset the large shortfall in revenues. Achieving the revised fiscal target was not easy and, in the event, it was only possible with expenditure cuts well beyond the program level and strengthened tax administration in the final quarter of 2001. The authorities also succeeded in reducing the public debt ratio modestly, in part, by increasing/protecting allocations for projects covered under the debt swap arrangement; however, the debt ratio still remains high. 36. Looking forward, the authorities have formulated an ambitious medium-term strategy appropriately aimed at substantially raising economic growth by accelerating structural reform, while at the same time consolidating macroeconomic stability, especially by considerably further reducing the ratio of public debt to GDP. The recently launched PSET, which involves both a bold reform agenda and sizable social sector programs aimed at alleviating poverty and reducing unemployment, is a central element of this strategy. While the staff endorsed the general objectives of the PSET, given the magnitude of the social sector initiatives that it envisages, strictly adhering to the principle of financing the PSET Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - outlays only through additional foreign grants and a limited proportion of privatization proceeds will be crucial for preserving macroeconomic stability and further reducing the public debt ratio. It will also be important to ensure that spending under the PSET does not overwhelm implementation capacity. Careful evaluation and prioritization of projects under the PSET will therefore be vital, and the staff very much welcomes the close involvement of the World Bank in this process, as well as in assisting the relevant agencies in capacity building. 37. The authorities’ program for 2002 has been appropriately cautious with regard to the implementation of the PSET, with spending limited to available grants and 30 percent of privatization proceeds, implying outlays substantially below those envisaged in the budget. While the overall fiscal stance including the PSET involves a modest increase in the deficit (including grants), this should still be consistent with a significant further reduction in the public debt ratio this year. The fiscal measures to be implemented shortly in order to achieve the fiscal target, especially the liberalization of the prices of animal feed and the extension of GST to zero-rated products (albeit at a low rate initially) are structurally sound and should have a lasting fiscal impact. The staff also welcomes the significant broadening of the size and scope of the income transfer program for the poor and increasing the living allowance for the public sector employees-despite substantial cuts in other areas-to offset the adverse impact of the upward adjustment in petroleum product prices. These positive considerations notwithstanding, there are significant downside risks to the fiscal program arising particularly from possible fluctuations in petroleum prices in the world market and Jordan’s dependence on the Iraqi oil grant. It would therefore be crucial for the authorities to review the developments in petroleum prices in the world market on a regular basis and adjust domestic petroleum prices, as needed, to protect the petroleum-related revenues assumed in the program. Strict adherence to expenditure control and limiting budgetary expenditures in line with the developments in revenue collection would also be critical for achieving the deficit target under the program. 38. The sizable addition to government spending under the PSET is expected to have a significant impact on domestic demand, and thus on growth, this year and next, even though a substantial part of the stimulus will leak out through the balance of payments, given the openness of the economy. Over the medium term, maintaining growth will require that the beneficial effects on investment of structural reforms, including those embodied in the PSET, replace the domestic demand stimulus. Thus it is vital that the envisaged reform program be vigorously implemented. Exports should continue to be the main engine of growth, with the recent signing of the FTA with the U.S. and the implementation of the Association Agreement with the E.U. providing stimulus. Inflation is not expected to pick up significantly as a result of the boost to domestic demand under the PSET, given the existence of excess capacity in the economy. And the balance of payments position should remain reasonably comfortable, even with higher imports on account of the spending under the PSET as these will be largely offset by higher grants. A financing gap will emerge, however, partly reflecting the end of Paris Club rescheduling associated with the extended arrangement. The medium-term outlook will depend critically on the authorities’ sound implementation of the PSET. In particular, the full implementation of the structural reform component must go Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - hand-in-hand with continued fiscal consolidation and strict adherence to the principle that spending only proceed in line with available financing and implementation capacity. 39. Jordan has made substantial progress over the last decade toward a sustainable level of debt through prudent demand and debt management policies, cutting the debt ratio by almost half. Nevertheless, the debt burden is still very high and would require further fiscal consolidation, albeit, at a modest pace, over the medium term. Rigidities in the fiscal structure on both revenue and expenditure sides and the ongoing trade and tariff reforms would create important challenges for the authorities. Protecting the revenue to GDP ratio at the prevailing level in the midst of tariff reforms would require further broadening of the direct tax base; increasing the 2 percent GST rate in steps to a more respectable level over the medium term; and replacing the oil surplus with GST and supplementary excises at appropriate rates to improve elasticity and protect budgetary revenues from fluctuations in world oil prices. Limiting the fiscal deficit to a sustainable level will also hinge critically on the government’s ability to contain expenditure growth by reforming the public pension system. 40. The current peg to the U.S. dollar and the supporting monetary policy has served Jordan well during the last decade by bringing inflation down to industrial country levels and fostering confidence in the Jordanian dinar. The surge in export growth in 2001 provides some assurance that, despite the real exchange rate appreciation in recent years, resulting from the strength of the U.S. dollar, competitiveness is not an.irnmediate concern. The authorities’ demonstrated willingness to raise interest rates promptly at times of pressure on external reserves has also imparted credibility to the pegged exchange rate regime. The staff emphasizes the importance of maintaining comfortable levels of reserves, with continued active interest rate policy to this end. Exchange rate policy should also be kept under review in light of developments in competitiveness and external performance. Jordan’s banking system appears to be generally sound, and the recent bank fraud case is not expected to undermine the financial health of the banking system. The prudential regulations and guidelines being implemented by the CBJ should also help to prevent recurrence of similar cases in the future. Nevertheless, the staff urges the authorities to participate in an FSAP exercise to identify the areas where the financial system and its regulatory and supervisory framework may need to be further strengthened. 41. Jordan has successfully contained the economic and political fallout of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict since September 2000. It has also withstood the global economic down-turn and the September 11 events with very little adverse impact, in part because of its strengthened macroeconomic foundation and intensified reform program in the context of the extended arrangement. Further risks, however, could come from changes in international sanctions on Iraq and a widening of the war on terrorism, which could also lead to a loss of the Iraqi oil grant. In particular, disruption of economic relations with Iraq-leading to loss of oil grant and a major export market-and further deterioration in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict could seriously impact Jordan’s economic outlook and require prompt and forceful policy response. Jordan would also need additional external financial support in its efforts to overcome such a shock and maintain macroeconomic stability and growth momentum. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-28 - Against this background, the staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to have a successor arrangement with the Fund, as an instrument to safeguard against such shocks, to respond expeditiously with appropriate policies, and to mobilize support from the international community. 42. Based on the considerations that most of the original macroeconomic objectives of the EFF program were achieved or exceeded, that significant progress was made on the fiscal front despite some slippage, and that the program for 2002 is strong and consistent with Jordan’s objective of achieving higher growth and employment over the medium term, the staff supports the authorities’ request for: (i) a waiver for nonobservance of the quantitative performance criterion for end-December relating to the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants); and (ii) completion of the fourth and fifth reviews under the expanded arrangement. 43. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Jordan be conducted on a twelve-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - VI.

Jordan has generally exceeded the original goals of the current EFF arrangement. Notwithstanding the difficult regional situation, growth accelerated between 1999 and 2001 to over 4 percent, while inflation remained subdued. At the same time, the authorities implemented an ambitious structural reform agenda, particularly in the area of trade liberalization, which materialized in strong export performance starting in 200 1. While some elements of the structural reforms have been delayed, in many other areas, the performance substantially exceeded program expectations and the goal of the reform agenda, namely to transform Jordan in a more dynamic market-oriented economy, has been largely achieved.

Macroeconomic Performance 2. Macroeconomic performance improved significantly between 1999 and 2001 (Table 1). In early 1999, when the current EFF arrangement was approved, Jordan was still suffering from a crisis of confidence in the Jordanian dinar associated with the death of His Majesty, King Hussein. The Fund-supported program approved in April 1999 envisaged economic growth picking up from 2 percent in 1999 to 3l% percent in 2001. This, however, proved a conservative estimate. With a resumption of monetary stability and a strong response of the private sector to the structural reform agenda, growth exceeded program targets in each year, with the 2001 growth outturn of 4.2 percent. At the same time, the expected pickup in inflation did not materialize, with Jordanian prices growing by about 1 percent per year on average over the three-year period.

Fiscal performance was less favorable (Table 2). The Fund-supported program had targeted a very ambitious fiscal adjustment path that in the event proved unattainable (Annex II). The revenue loss associated with trade reforms and the inherent inelasticity of non-tax revenues, compounded by rising pension liabilities, implied a slight loosening of the fiscal stance over the program period, from 3.5 percent of GDP in 1999 to 3.7 percent of GDP in 200 1. In addition, the higher than expected grants during 2000-O 1 created more room for additional spending without affecting the debt dynamics. Accordingly, the quantitative performance criterion relating to the fiscal deficit, defined excluding grants under the program, was repeatedly missed, including in 2001 (Table 3). The looser fiscal stance, however, did not result in a worsening debt burden. On the contrary, the program targets for government and government-guaranteed external debt were exceeded by a large margin, as external debt was substantially reduced in nominal terms, mainly through the use of privatization proceeds to reduce net debt and the debt swaps and buy-back operations. As a result, external debt amounted to less than 80 percent of GDP at end-200 1, some 7 percentage points below the programmed level. 4. The external position was substantially strengthened over the program period. The program had envisaged a widening external current account deficit and a moderate accumulation of reserves. In the event, the current account remained in surplus throughout the program period, partly boosted by large U.N. compensation payments in 1999 and 2000 and a sharp increase in export receipts in 2001. Net usable reserves more than doubled since end-1998 and stood at about US$2.6 billion at end-2001 (equivalent to 7 months of import cover). Confidence in exchange rate peg was restored early on in the program and remains high, despite the uncertain regional economic environment. Structural Reforms 5. Considerable progress was made during the program period in the area of trade liberalization, financial sector reform and public enterprise restructuring. In the trade area, the maximum import tariff was reduced to 30 percent; Jordan acceded to the WTO in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - 2000; and a Free Trade Agreement with the United States came into effect at end-2001. In the financial sector, government securities were introduced in 2000 through a regular series of auctions. In addition, a new public debt law was enacted in 2001 that bars the central bank from providing direct credit to the government and sets strict goals for the reduction of government debt by 2006. As for public enterprise restructuring, Royal Jordanian was substantially restructured and its main subsidiaries were sold off in 2000 and 200 1. A minority share of Jordan Telecom was sold to a consortium led by France Telecom in 2000. A consortium was also chosen in 2001 to build and operate the first independent power producer, while consultants were selected to advise on the privatization of the electricity and distribution systems. 6. A few structural reforms, however, were modified or delayed. In the area of domestic petroleum prices, the authorities decided to make only ad hoc upward adjustments to protect the fiscal revenue during the program period, rather than to adopt a strategy for relating domestic to import prices. Moreover, the presentation of a pension reform strategy had to be delayed, as the required additional technical assistance from FAD was delayed in the aftermath of September 11. Finally, the implementation of a power purchase agreement between the electricity generation and distribution companies was postponed to allow the consultants to integrate the power purchase agreement in the overall privatization strategy for the electricity sector.

Jordan’s macroeconomic management over the last decade has been complicated by large fiscal deficits and the high debt burden. Fiscal consolidation efforts under the EFF-supported program have been frustrated by rigidities in the fiscal structure and the adverse revenue effects of some structural reforms. The failure to realize the program’s medium-term expenditure and revenue targets despite substantial reform of the tax system resulted in a deficit (excluding grants) of 8 percent of GDP in 2001, double the original target. However, with a primary surplus including grants in most years, Jordan’s public debt declined steadily throughout the last decade-frequently faster than programmed-in part because of higher grants and debt operations (e.g., buy-backs, and debt swaps). This annex describes the key fiscal issues facing Jordan and outlines a medium-term fiscal strategy for attaining sustainable fiscal balance and debt. 2. Rigidities in the fiscal structure exist on both the revenue and the expenditure side. On the revenue side, nontax revenue accounts for about one-third of domestic revenue and is generally inelastic and volatile. The ongoing tariff reductions have reduced overall revenue as a share of GDP. Tax administration is complicated by incentives, exemptions, and the complexity of the tax legislation. The expenditure side is also quite rigid with wages, pensions, the military, and interest accounting for over 70 percent of outlays. Pension outlays, in particular, are becoming increasingly burdensome. Furthermore, the regional situation limits the scope for a significant reduction in military outlays. The high foreign debt (about 80 percent of the total) limits the scope for recouping some of the interest through taxation, CBJ profit transfers, and indirectly through absorption resulting from the spending of interest income. Given Jordan’s high population growth and incidence of poverty, there is little scope for reducing spending on development, health, education, and income transfer programs. These rigidities in the fiscal structure, but particularly the trend decline in nontax revenue and the rapid growth in pensions, imply sizable fiscal efforts simply to prevent the deficit from widening. 3. The fiscal adjustment path should take into account the rigidities in the fiscal structure and include other steps to reduce debt. Jordan’s current debt can be considered sustainable in the sense that it is on a diminishing trend in relation to GDP; however, boosting economic growth would allow a faster resolution of the debt overhang. The recently announced Plan for Social and Economic Transformation (PSET) could compromise the debt reduction objective if its sizable new expenditure programs (4 percent of GDP per year) and initial tax cut proposals are implemented imprudently. However, a well-specified and more limited PSET could be integrated into a stable macroeconomic framework and be compatible with debt reduction. For these reasons, the authorities have decided that the PSET will be: (i) financed only through additional grants and limited use of privatization receipts; (ii) fully integrated into the budget to ensure financial accountability; and (iii) controlled in its recurrent cost implications. As a result of the positive growth impact from greater infrastructure and human capital spending associated with the PSET, the debt ratio could decline significantly over the initial years, and would continue to decline moderately thereafter if its recurrent cost implications are limited.

Implementing the fiscal strategy described below would allow to reduce the government and government-guaranteed net debt to 64 percent of GDP in 2007, from 94 percent in 2001. This would require a reduction in the deficit after grants to less than 3 percent of GDP (6 percent of GDP before grants). This adjustment is less ambitious than the original EFF-supported program, but the revised fiscal targets would still require substantial policy efforts, given the above-noted rigidities, and would likely be more achievable. Although the PSET would imply an initial increase in spending during 2002-03, fiscal efforts (revenue and expenditure measures) of almost 2 percentage points of GDP a year on average during 2002-07 would be required, in addition to about 2 percent of GDP each year through below-the-line debt operations and privatization. More emphasis would need to be put on revenue mobilization and improvement of the tax system (particularly in the GST and direct tax areas), where there is greater scope for success. In addition, clearly specified policies to contain expenditure growth in pensions, wages, defense, and goods and services should be identified. 5. Policy reforms aimed at improving tax revenue and rationalizing nontax revenues are crucial. Revenue gains from GST could be significant if the GST is extended to energy products (gasoline, gas and electricity), construction, and transportation and its administration is improved. Replacing the oil surplus with the GST and specific excises on petroleum products would eliminate the current volatility of oil-based revenue and constitute a significant structural reform. Direct tax revenue is quite low (3.1 percent of GDP in 200 l), and revenue gains could be significant if the income tax law is reformed with a view to unifying the maximum tax rates; taxing interests, dividends, and capital gains; and removing the numerous exemptions and deductions. Taxes on foreign trade would continue to decline with further tariff reform and rationalization, but the loss could be offset by the above- mentioned tax measures and by imposing supplementary excise duties on selected products (at uniform rates for domestic and import goods) and eliminating customs exemptions. A reduction in the ratio of nontax revenue to GDP would be unavoidable over the medium term, as fees are brought in line with the cost of providing the associated government service. 6. Tax administration reform should play a center role for revenue mobilization. The tax reform agenda described above should reduce the administrative burden by eliminating exemptions and improving the legal clarity of tax legislation. In the area of GST administration, it would be important to (1) reduce nonfilers to a minimum; (2) ensure that accounting records are up-to-date and accurate; (3) undertake risk-based audits to improve GST compliance; and (4) improve the refund mechanism. Regarding the income tax, it would be important to move to a system of self-assessment based on verifiable enterprise accounts prepared according to internationally-accepted accounting standards. This would improve the transparency of the tax system for the taxpayer and reduce the scope for negotiated tax payments. In the area of customs administration, emphasis should be placed on improving valuation and classification of imports together with measures to reduce smuggling. Finally, consideration could be given to creating a unified tax administration under the control of the Ministry of Finance to provide for a more strategic orientation and better coordination of the tax services.

Reduction in current outlays by almost 4 percentage points of GDP over the medium term would require determined efforts to contain expenditure growth in most areas to offset expenditure items that cannot be easily adjusted in the short-run (e.g., pensions). The rapid growth in pension payments can only be contained through speedy implementation of pension reforms for the military and civil service, including steps to increase the length of service (e.g., by unifying the retirement age for men and women) to dampen pension growth in the medium term until the longer-term reforms take hold. A sharp reduction in military expenditure would be unrealistic given the security environment in the region; however, savings to the tune of l/3 percent of GDP a year could be possible by making a deliberate effort to limit the growth of budgetary allocations for the military to less than nominal GDP growth. Generating the additional cumulative expenditure reduction over the medium term would only be possible by: (1) freezing the size of the civil service and limiting the growth of the wage bill to 2 percent in real terms while allowing for a gradual decompression of public sector wages (cumulative effect of % percent of GDP); (2) keeping expenditures on purchases of goods and services fixed in real terms; (3) pension reform (% percent of GDP). Finally, a major source of savings would be the reduction in interest payments (about % percent of GDP), if the authorities succeed in implementing the strategy. 8. Greater reliance on domestic financing would reduce dependence on external financing and the resulting vulnerabilities. The excessive dependency on external borrowing in the past, partly due to the legal limit on domestic borrowing, was a one major reason for Jordan’s external debt problem. With the new Law on Public Borrowing, which requires the government to limit external debt to less than 60 percent of GDP by 2006, domestic financing will need to play a larger role. While the increased reliance on domestic financing could potentially crowd out the private sector, preliminary calculations indicate that there would still be room for adequate private credit expansion over the medium term, in particular given the SSC surpluses. 9. The fiscal strategy should be complemented by a public enterprise restructuring and privatization program which would limit any potential contingent liabilities from mismanaged public enterprises. In this respect, it would also be important to restructure those public enterprise, where complete privatization is not feasible or desirable. In those cases, tariffs at cost recovery levels will be necessary to avoid burdening the budget with losses, particularly for the pricing of water.

Safeguard Assessment Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) was subject to the transitional procedures with respect to the EFF Fund arrangement approved on April 15, 1999, which is scheduled to expire on April 14,2002. The transitional procedures required a review of only the CBJ’s external audit mechanism. This assessment determines whether the CBJ publishes annual financial statements that are independently audited in accordance with internationally accepted standards. The external audit assessment was completed on May 23,200l. The assessment concluded that CBJ’s current external audit mechanism may not be adequate in certain respects and appropriate recommendations have been made to the authorities, as reported in paragraph 40 of EBS/01/136. VIII. Exchange System The Jordanian dinar is a fully convertible currency, is officially pegged to the SDR.

As of January 3 1,2002, Jordan had received 6 1 Bank loans and 15 IDA credits totaling US$l,939.7 million net of cancellations and terminations. All the credits and 54 of the loans have been fully disbursed. Project implementation and disbursement performance have been satisfactory. The IFC has made cumulative loans and equity investment approvals of US$237 million; and in addition, about US$78 million in syndications. 2. The World Bank’s country assistance strategy (CAS) discussed with the Executive Board in December 1999 provided support to government’s key objective of returning the Jordanian economy to a higher growth path, promoting human development, improving the efficiency of the public sector and improving the water resource management and the environment, and to reduce poverty. The strategy has been pursued through a series of policy-based adjustment loans to support structural reforms and development loans in key sectors. The centerpiece of the current CAS (2000-02) is a series of three single-tranche adjustment loans to support in-depth public sector reforms. The first Public Sector Reform Project was discussed by the Executive Board on June 21,200l and the PSRL for US$120 million has been disbursed. A second Loan is planned for Board presentation in May 2002. 3. The World Bank is supporting the government’s direct interventions to fight poverty through the Social Productivity Program. The Bank loans are directly supporting the community infrastructure and job training programs, while Bank’s technical services have helped in the design of the other components of the program. The World Bank also continues to address critical physical, institutional, and policy constraints through investment projects in tourism, water supply, and health sector reforms. Assistance is also planned for export and investment promotion, agricultural services, and water and wastewater management. Provided the government’s adjustment and reform programs stay on track, the World Bank expects to be able to commit approximately US$300-US$400 million in new lending to Jordan during 200 l-03. 4. The World Banks nonlending and economic and sector work provides analytical support for the government’s reform programs. Recent work has dealt with privatization, trade incentives, financial development, the role of government, the nature of and response to poverty, the needs and opportunities facing the private sector, the water sector, the health sector, and the higher education sector. The World Bank has prepared a study on Jordan’s Sources of Growth and held a seminar on the findings of the study in April 2001 in Amman. Follow up discussions were held in July 200 1. The Bank has helped the government in setting up a Global Development Learning Center at the University of Jordan.

Statistics are being compiled and released on a more timely basis, although with some delays. Work is ongoing on implementing the 1993 System of National Accounts. Government finance-Data provision is generally adequate for program monitoring purposes. Statistics covering the budgetary central government (about 85 percent of general government) are published on a monthly basis, with a timeliness of about one month. The February 2002 ROSC mission (Data Module) recommended that (i) the institutional coverage of annual data be expanded to all the units of general government, (ii) details of financing be disseminated in national publications, and (iii) that government guaranteed debt be shown separately from outstanding government debt. Recommendations were also made to further align the classifications of revenue and expenditure with GFS methodology. Monetary sector-Monetary data for the central bank and the commercial banks are reported and published on a monthly basis. As of January 2001, the CBJ’s financial statements are being compiled on an accrual basis. Two nonbank financial institutions (Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation and Jordan Mortgage Refinance Company) are incorrectly classified in monetary statistics as “other banking institutions.” At present, consistency checks between government finance statistics and monetary statistics are not conducted. Balance of payments statistics-Improved policy formulation and better program monitoring would require a more comprehensive coverage and detailed classification of some current account as well as all financial account components of the balance of payments. Most deficiencies in the coverage and classification of the balance of payments statistics reflect gaps in the data sources. The February 2002 ROSC mission (Data Module) found that balance of payments statistics follow only to a limited extent the conceptual framework of the fourth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (BPA44). Work toward adopting the recommendations set forth in the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (BP&D,) have been limited, mainly, because of serious resource constraints. The mission also found that while the residency criteria is in general in accordance with BPMS, there are misclassification of current account components and very few details of the financial account. Also, since international transactions of individuals and corporations are only partially recorded, the coverage of the data is deficient, especially for investment income and the financial account. The recommendations of the ROSC mission included (i) increasing staff and computing resources to improve performance of existing tasks and support plans to adopt BPMS, (ii) creating a Balance of Payments Committee to develop and monitor a medium-term plan to compile balance of payments and international investment position statistics based on BPMS, (iii) reclassify workers’ remittances under transfers and income as a separate component of the current account, and (iv) expand data sources to improve the classification of accounts.

During 2002-10, Jordan’s labor force is projected to expand by about 3.6 percent a year. With a target of reducing the unemployment rate from around 15 percent currently to 6 percent by 2010, employment would have to grow by about 4.8 percent a year. An important prerequisite for this scenario to be realized is an effective matching of labor supply and demand and flexibility of real wages. In the absence of labor market adjustment, Jordan’s demographic pressures will translate into higher unemployment, a decline in the participation rate and possibly labor migration. 2. In recent years, reservation wages appear not to have come down, despite persistently high unemployment rates, hampering labor market adjustment. The persistently high number of applicants for public sectors jobs indicates that workers prefer to queue for a limited number of jobs in the public sector instead of lowering their reservation wages and applying for jobs in the private sector. This is partly due to a strong preference for public sector jobs, which are considered more prestigious and more secure. Salaries and benefits are, in general, also more generous in the public sector. Except for higher-level managerial and professional jobs, the public sector pays higher salaries for almost all job categories; up to 40 percent more for low-skilled labor. This misalignment raises private sector reservation wages for Jordanian workers, hinders labor market adjustment and raises the natural rate of unemployment. Meanwhile, immigrant workers satisfy the demand for low-skilled labor in the private sector. In 200 1, the number of legal and illegal immigrant workers was estimated between 200,000 and 300,000. 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 Figure 1.

Labor market adjustment is also hampered by the apparent mismatch of skills. Supported by low tuition fees, a strong cultural preference for education and a history of exporting skilled labor, Jordan’s enrolment rate is one of the highest in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Mismatch of skills however limits the absorption of graduates Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 60 - in the labor market. Youth unemployment currently stands at almost 40 percent for the age group 15-l 9 (Figure 1). The unemployment rate for students who completed a vocational apprenticeship is also surprisingly high at 12 percent for men and 44 percent for women. College and university graduates face high unemployment rates as well (9 percent for men and 19 percent for women). 4. Restricting immigrant labor is unlikely to facilitate the absorption of additional labor supply, given the informal nature of many of these jobs; it could also harm Jordan’s competitiveness. If job creation does not keep up with the demographic trends, export of labor could help reduce unemployment. However, this would also reduce the pressure to adjust reservation wages, since export of labor reduces domestic labor supply. Although workers’ remittances account for a significant portion of domestic income (20.6 percent in 2001) the macroeconomic gains would be higher if the labor were employed domestically. Migrant labor in fact often returns to Jordan with higher skills and physical capital after working abroad for a number of years. 5. From a labor market perspective, a strategy aimed at lowering reservation wages would best serve private sector job growth in the medium term. Bringing public sector employment policies in line with the private sector is an important step in this respect. As envisaged under the PSET, continued reform of the public education system, quality assessment of private sector vocational training and higher education, and increased private sector involvement in designing curricula would help reduce skills mismatch, support labor market adjustment and reduce the natural rate of unemployment. 6. Poverty reduction would also benefit from reforms aimed at employment generation. In the period 1992-l 997 both poverty and official unemployment declined, despite a fall in per capita consumption. A recent study by the World Bank indicated that a reduction in income inequality also contributed to poverty reduction. Preliminary calculations indicate that the share of the population living below the poverty line remained approximately the same in the period 1997-2001 at 13-14 percent. In 1997 the poverty line was JD 3 14. Adjusting for the increase in the CPI, it rose to JD 337 in 2001. The poverty line is projected to rise to JD 387 per person in 2007. Assuming that population growth is 2.8 percent annually from 2001 on and there is a small reduction in income inequality, it is estimated that by 2007 the share of the population living below the poverty line will fall to about 11 percent. These estimates are based on a projected population increase of 0.8 million to 5.8 million in 2007 (Table 1). Since poverty is linked to unemployment, as confirmed by the 1997 labor force survey, a reduction in the unemployment rate would significantly reduce the poverty rate.

Jordan’s domestic export growth in 2001 was very strong-an estimated 25 percent, compared to an annual average growth of 1 percent in the preceding five years. The export boom has come despite a steady appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of the dinar and a deterioration in the terms of trade over the last two years. Trade liberalization, combined with such preferential market access schemes as the Qualified Investment Zones (QIZs), appear to have been the engine behind Jordan’s export performance in 2001. 2. The legal provisions for QIZs were established in 1996 when the United States offered special duty- and quota-free access to goods produced in designated zones with specified minimum Jordanian and Israeli content. QIZ status is generally granted to an industrial estate, and manufacturers in these estates must seek approval of their products from a committee jointly chaired by Jordan and Israel with a U.S. observer. To meet eligibility requirements, the product must be “substantially transformed” with 35 percent of its value added in Israel, a Jordanian QIZ, or the West Bank/Gaza. Of this 35 percent, a minimum of 11.7 percent must be added in a Jordanian QIZ, 8 percent in Israel (7 percent for high tech goods), and the remaining 15.3 percent from a QIZ, Israel or West Bank/Gaza; or Jordanian and Israeli manufacturers must contribute at least 20 percent of the total cost of production). Textiles and apparel have reportedly been the central focus of activity in these zones, as the QIZ circumvents an otherwise onerous U.S. duty of up to 22 percent. However, QIZs have been slow to establish and begin operations. While the legal framework was established in 1996, U.S. authorities did not designate the first QIZ until 1998. An additional nine QIZs Table 1.

The content and direction of Jordanian exports supports the notion that QIZs have helped to diversify exports and contributed to export growth. Over the last five years, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - Jordan’s exports have shifted away from reliance on mining, in favor of textiles, apparel, footwear, pharmaceuticals, and light manufactures (Table 1). Most of the rapid growth in overall exports seen in 2001 is also captured by these goods, and the most rapidly growing industrial base for such merchandise is the QIZs. Jordan’s QIZ exports jumped as a large number of new companies completed installation and came on line in 2000-01. Official data indicate that exports from the seven largest QIZs rose from US$2.4 million in 1999, to US$25 million in 2000, and to US$l50 million in 2001. These same zones have reportedly created 19,000 new jobs. 4. The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Area Agreement (FTA) has given rise to some concern that companies operating in the QIZs will lose their competitive edge. But there are substantive differences between the market access granted under the FTA and that under the QIZ scheme. First, the FTA is a phased arrangement, with duties on a number of products eliminated only after 10 years. Products exported from the QIZs, on the other hand, have immediate duty and quota free access. Second, the rules of origin between the two schemes are significantly different. Under the FTA, goods must have a minimum of 35 percent value added in Jordan to qualify for duty free access, versus 11.7 percent under the QIZ scheme. The combination of phased access and tougher value added requirements suggests that QIZs will retain their attractiveness to investors for some time. Table 2.

One issue of concern in recent months is growing difficulty in moving QIZ products across the border for shipment out of Haifa. The escalating violence in the West Bank and Gaza has heightened security measures at the border, generating significant transport delays. The requirement for a minimum value addition in Israel and with limited room for increasing shipments out of Aqaba, continued regional security problems could pose a downside risk for Jordanian exports in 2002.

Dear Mr. Kiihler, 1. The government of Jordan has held discussions with Fund staff in the context of the fourth and fifth reviews of the program supported by the three-year extended arrangement approved in April 1999. Based on these discussions, the attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews macroeconomic developments and implementation of structural policies over the past year, describes the government’s economic policies for 2002, including new initiatives under the Plan for Social and Economic Transformation. The government believes that Jordan’s economic performance under the 2001 program was strong, exceeding expectations in several areas, and that the policies for 2002 are consistent with sound medium-term objectives. Accordingly, we hereby request completion of the fourth and fifth reviews under the extended arrangement. 2. Notwithstanding the generally strong performance in 200 1, the performance criterion for end-December 2001 on the government’s overall fiscal deficit was missed. As described in the MEFP, fiscal performance in 2001 was adversely affected by developments in revenues-which suffered from teething problems relating to the extension of the GST at the retail level and the sharp drop in tourism activity and private sector investment-because of the September 11 events and the worsening conflict in the West Bank and Gaza. These developments were unexpected, and we partly compensated for these shortfalls by keeping expenditures below the programmed level. On this basis, we request a waiver for the missed performance criterion. 3. We stand ready to consult with the Fund on the adoption of any additional measures that may be required to achieve the program’s objectives. We will continue to provide the Fund with any information that may be necessary for the assessment of policy implementation and performance under the program.

This memorandum reviews economic performance during 2001, outlines the government’s medium-term macroeconomic objectives, incorporating the Plan for Social and Economic Transformation (PSET), and describes the government’s economic policies for 2002. VII. DEVELOPMENTS~NDERTHE 2001 MACROECONOMICPROGRAM 2. Jordan’s economic performance in 2001 generally exceeded program objectives. It was characterized by stronger-than-expected growth, low inflation, the maintenance of a comfortable level of official international reserves, and a significant reduction in net public debt in relation to GDP. Real GDP grew by 4.2 percent in 2001, despite the adverse effects of the September 11 events and the worsening conflict in West Bank and Gaza. This growth was fairly broad based, led by strong increases in domestic exports (25 percent), construction (11.1 percent), transport and communication (5.6 percent), and manufacturing (4.9 percent). At the same time, consumer price inflation averaged less than 2 percent. Official international reserves remained stable during 2001 at about US$2.6 billion, equivalent to 7 months of import cover, 30 percent of JD broad money, and over 100 percent of reserve money. Government and government guaranteed net debt declined by 2 percentage points to 94 percent of GDP, a cumulative reduction of 65 percentage points over the last decade. The Amman Stock Exchange index rose by 30 percent in 200 1, buoyed by strong performance of the financial sector and the U.S. ratification of the Free Trade Agreement. 3. Significant progress was made in fiscal consolidation in 2001 through the reduction of the overall fiscal deficit of the central government including grants and nontreasury accounts. The deficit so defined fell by 1 percentage point to 3.7 percent of GDP. This was attributable to: firm actions to hold budgetary expenditures below the program level (by ‘% percent of GDP) despite privatization and debt-swap related outlays of 1.3 percent of GDP; and an increase in tax and nontax revenues (0.6 percent of GDP) over the preceding year, despite shortfalls relative to targeted levels. The composition of expenditure also improved with, in particular, an increased allocation for capital expenditure. As measured under the program, the overall fiscal deficit included debt for development spending of 0.6 percent of GDP, which reduced Jordan’s foreign debt by the equivalent of 1 percent of GDP. The lower deficit and debt for development operations helped to reduce government and government-guaranteed debt by about 2% percentage points in relation to GDP in 2001. 4. These positive fiscal developments notwithstanding, the fiscal deficit before grants was higher than targeted by 1 percent of GDP because of shortfalls in tax and nontax revenues. Tax revenue was adversely affected by teething problems associated with the extension of GST to the retail sector; the fall in tourism activity due to the Intzjkda and the September 11 events; and the temporary tax relief provided to the hotel and travel industries. Nontax revenues were much less buoyant than expected as a result of low international prices Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 66 - ATTACHMENT I ATTACHMENT for phosphate and potash, which affected transfers to the budget from the mining corporations; also, the postponement of plans by foreign investors in the aftermath of September 11 resulted in a loss in royalties/fees. Prompt actions by the government to contain expenditures partly offset the revenue shortfall, and we succeeded in limiting the fiscal deficit (including grants) to 3.7 percent of GDP, which was somewhat below the revised target discussed with the IMF mission in November 200 1. We would also note that, at the level of the consolidated public sector (a broader fiscal concept that also includes autonomous public agencies, the Social Security Corporation, and the CBJ), the deficit is preliminarily estimated to have been significantly smaller at about 2 percent of GDP. However, the performance criteria on the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) for end- September and end-December 200 1 established in August 200 1 were missed. 5. Monetary policy continued to support the fixed exchange rate anchor, with developments in 2001 reflecting growing confidence in the economy. The comfortable international reserve position was maintained. Interest rates on three-month CBJ certificates of deposit (CDs) fell by 2 percentage points in 2001, following the decline in U.S. Treasury bill rates, and stood at 3.9 percent at end-January 2002. Credit to the private sector rebounded strongly (by more than 11 percent) in response to lower interest rates and growing investor confidence. Jordanian banks have remained well capitalized and the banking system is sound. In early February, three small banks experienced difficulties as a result of a fraud case involving falsified contracts used as collateral to secure loans. The total amount of the loans involved is limited, some of this amount will be recovered through judicial processes underway, and any residual losses can be absorbed by the banks in question, with no use of public funds. This case will have no macroeconomic implications. Starting in January 2002, the CBJ also brought its loan classification in line with Basle core standards by reducing the period for classifying doubtful loans from 120 days to 90 days. 6. The balance of payments outlook has improved significantly. The strength of the export sector reflects our efforts over the last several years to liberalize Jordan’s trade regime and increase foreign market access, including through a Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. ratified in December 200 1. Import growth has remained relatively subdued (5 percent in 2001), partly reflecting the decline in oil prices. The shortfall in tourism receipts was partly compensated by strong inflows of remittances. As a result, the external current account (including grants) recorded a modest surplus in 2001, compared to a deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP envisaged under the program. 7. The government has made solid progress with its structural reform agenda, especially after the adoption of the PSET. A consortium has been selected to build and operate a power plant as Jordan’s first independent power producer. Consultants have been selected to advise on the privatization of the electricity generation and distribution companies. The duty free and catering subsidiaries of the Royal Jordanian (RJ) airline were sold last year. In addition, the Jordan Investment Corporation (JIC) has sold two companies and shares in another 2 small companies. The terms of sale of the remaining shares of the cement company have been finalized and the sale should be concluded soon. Discussions are continuing on the sale of RJ’s remaining noncore operations, but the privatization of the airline itself had to be Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 67 - ATTACHMENT I ATTACHMENT postponed as a result of the current difficult environment for the airline industry. Preparation and presentation to Cabinet of a strategy for the reform of the public pension system, a structural benchmark for end-December 2001, had to be postponed, partly because of a delay in securing technical assistance from the Fund in the aftermath of September 11. In the meantime, the Cabinet decided in January 2002 to enroll all new military personnel in the Social Security Corporation (SSC) as part of a contributory pension plan. VIII. MEDIUM-TERMMACROECONOMICFRAMEWORKANDPOLICIESFOR 2002 A. Medium-Term Framework 8. The government’s central objective for the period ahead is to raise further economic growth and living standards through the deepening of structural reform and the continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies, including further fiscal consolidation. This is manifested in the objectives of the PSET. Real GDP growth of about 4 percent recorded during 1999-2001 was well below the 5.5-6 percent growth rate required for the Jordanian economy to absorb large inflows into the labor market, while, at the same time, steadily reducing the unemployment rate from its current level of about 15 percent. Accordingly, the thrust of the government’s program-as encapsulated in the Plan for Social and Economic Transformation (PSET) announced by His Majesty King Abdullah II in November 200 l-is to stimulate private investment, strengthen economic growth and social development, and consolidate monetary and fiscal stability. This will be achieved through increasing the capacity of the economy to absorb more private sector investment, through human resource development, employment generation, increased quality of basic government services as well as through the implementation of fiscal, administrative, regulatory, and judicial reforms. Moreover, the interlinkages between all the different components of the PSET should strengthen its integrated approach, and ensure that the overall objectives are achieved. The macroeconomic framework will be underpinned by a medium-term fiscal strategy entailing continued fiscal consolidation consistent with a steady decline in the public debt burden. A sizable further reduction in the ratio of the public debt to GDP will be crucial for improving the quality of government expenditures, lowering real interest rates and fostering investor confidence. 9. Achieving our growth and employment objectives will require accelerating the pace of structural reforms, while simultaneously fostering human resource development to promote private investment and employment generation. Key elements of the government’s program will include: legislative, legal, and administrative reforms to improve the business climate; accelerated privatization of virtually all remaining commercial enterprises; a private sector-led investment program; human resource (education and health) development; and the alleviation of poverty, including through rural development. The cost of the PSET is projected to be up to JD 275 million (about 4 percent of GDP) per year for the next four years, on top of the existing allocation for social sector programs in the budget. The government intends to finance the additional outlays under the PSET through additional grants and a limited use of future privatization proceeds, with the remainder of the latter used to help reduce the public debt burden. Because the PSET involves a large public sector Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 68 - ATTACHMENT I ATTACHMENT resource commitment over a number of years and will entail sizable recurrent outlays over a much longer period, the government is seeking multi-year financing from donors in order to ensure achievement of our medium-term macroeconomic objectives. 10. The private sector investments that will accrue as a result of the privatization transactions and the acceleration of the implementation of major projects will enhance prospects for growth. Spending on social sector initiatives associated with the PSET is likely to boost domestic demand and output in the near term. Excluding this temporary boost to output, the medium-term macroeconomic framework envisages: real GDP growth increasing to about 5% percent on a sustainable basis by 2006; continued moderate inflation (about 2 percent); a small deficit in the external current account; a reduction in external debt in relation to GDP to comfortable levels; and maintenance of external official reserves within a comfortable range of 6-7 months of imports. The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) would decline to less than 3 percent of GDP by 2006 from the targeted 4.1 percent of GDP in 2002, despite an assumed reduction in grants (by about 1 percentage point of GDP). The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) would need to be reduced by 2 percentage points over the 4- year period to 2006, after increasing in 2002 reflecting PSET-related expenditures. The steady reduction in the fiscal deficit, together with the use of sizable proportion of privatization proceeds for debt reduction purposes (in the form of higher bank deposits or debt buybacks or swaps), would reduce total government and government-guaranteed net debt by about 28 percentage points to 67 percent of GDP by 2006. We are aware that achieving these ambitious targets will not be easy and will require determined efforts, given the structural rigidities in the budget (e.g., large debt service payments, military outlays, rapidly growing pension liabilities, dependence on nontax revenues, tariff reforms to liberalize trade), and the spending pressures to meet the needs of our still rapidly growing population. 11. The medium-term outlook for the balance of payments projects a gradual shift back to small current account deficits, largely due to the ending of UN compensation payments and implementation of the PSET. Underlying export growth is expected to remain robust (conservatively projected to be 8l% percent) during 2002-06, reflecting continued growth in manufacturing exports and additional market access through the Free Trade Agreement with the United States and the Association Agreement with the EU. Import growth is expected to expand, particularly in the 2002-03 as the PSET is implemented and a number of large-scale water and energy projects are undertaken by the private sector. The small current account deficit is expected to be partly offset, however, by additional grants and privatization proceeds. Given the expected shift of the current account into deficit, a high level of amortization payments falling due in the coming years, and the need to maintain a comfortable reserve position, financing gaps are expected to appear over the medium term. These gaps reflect: (i) the need to address the high level of unemployment and poverty through accelerated growth, and (ii) the medium-term goal of maintaining a comfortable reserve position to withstand external vulnerabilities arising from the difficult regional environment. We are in touch with the Paris Club and intend to approach it formally regarding a comprehensive restructuring of the stock of debt owed to bilateral official creditors in order to solve the debt problem permanently. We also intend to initiate Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 69 - ATTACHMENT I ATTACHMENT discussions on a program which could be supported by a new Fund arrangement following the expiration of the current extended arrangement. B. Policies for 2002 12. Economic policies for 2002 are designed to sustain economic growth in the face of a difficult regional situation, maintain price stability, increase foreign exchange reserves by a moderate amount, and achieve a further reduction in net public debt consistent with our medium-term fiscal strategy. We expect the strong performance of the export sector to continue this year, which, together with the positive growth impact of the PSET, is expected to accelerate real GDP growth to about 5.1 percent, with PSET expenditures contributing about 1 percentage point. Inflation for 2002 is expected to accelerate somewhat to 3.5 percent, mainly as a result of the fiscal measures and market oriented reforms outlined below; underlying inflation will remain at around 2 percent. The external outlook will continue to remain comfortable with the current account roughly in balance and the overall balance of payments continuing to be in small surplus. Fiscal Policy 13. Consistent with our macroeconomic objectives, the 2002 core budget announced in January aims at further reducing the fiscal deficit (including grants) to 3.6 percent of GDP. The budget also includes, as Chapter II, the expenditure program associated with the PSET, execution of which is subject to availability of additional grants and privatization proceeds. Although PSET-related expenditure was envisaged to be JD 275 million (4 percent of GDP) at the time of the budget announcement, it is now expected to be up to JD 200 million (3 percent of GDP) in 2002, because of delays in securing financing from bilateral donors. Projects are now being prioritized in line with likely available financing. We expect to finance the PSET outlays through additional foreign grants of JD 160 million and privatization proceeds of up to JD 40 million (30 percent of the total expected privatization proceeds of JD 135 million). On this basis, the consolidated fiscal deficit (including the PSET and net change in nontreasury accounts) would be limited to 4.1 percent of GDP. Wit1 half of the deficit covered by privatization proceeds, the fiscal stance would still allow for a further significant reduction in the debt to GDP ratio. The proportion of privatization proceeds to be spent, however, would be kept under review, and adjusted downward if receipts from privatization or progress in reducing public debt were less than expected. 14. Achieving the fiscal target, given the structural rigidities on both revenue and expenditure sides of the budget and the adverse impact of several ongoing reforms on revenues, will require substantial additional fiscal efforts. In particular: ongoing trade liberalization initiatives, including the phased elimination of customs duties on industrial imports, would entail an annualized revenue loss of l/2 percent of GDP; measures associated with direct tax reforms and increased loan-loss provisioning for banks, granted as part of financial sector reform initiatives, are expected to cost 0.1 percent of GDP annually; and the teething problems associated with broadening the GST base at the retail level through the lowering of the GST threshold could also dampen the revenue outlook. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 70 - ATTACHMENT I ATTACHMENT 15. In order to realize the revenue target under the budget, despite the losses mentioned above, the government has decided to implement by May 1 the following measures yielding JD 94 million (1.4 percent of GDP) on an annualized basis. The new measures (with annualized yields in parenthesis) include: (i) increasing the prices of fuel oil, diesel, kerosene, and LPG that are below world market prices by a weighted average of 10 percent (JD 34 million); (ii) extending the GST at a rate of 2 percent to all previously exempted or zero-rated products (JD 25 million); (iii) reducing the tariff rate on industrial inputs to only 3 percent, with a revenue loss to JD 16 million; and (iv) raising the prices of animal feed (chaff and barley) to market levels. For diesel and kerosene, the government will pass a cabinet decision by May 1 for the price increase to take effect by June 1. As discussed below, steps will be taken in the meantime to offset the impact on the poor of the price increases for petroleum products. In addition, we expect that banks will pay part of their income tax payment (JD 10 million) in advance, as in 200 1. The government is also committed to raising the price of bread gradually at an appropriate time, so as to liberalize the markets for wheat and bread. Other possible tax reforms will be phased in over the medium term in a broadly revenue neutral manner and will not be considered before the next budget because of their potential adverse revenue effects. 16. Efforts are underway to strengthen GST administration. The GST Department has already sent assessment notices (including penalties) to 2,500 nonfilers. The status of nonfilers will be determined by June 1, 2002 by either canceling their registration (if they have ceased taxable business activities) or by requiring them to file tax returns. The taxpayer data in the computer system has already been brought fully up-to-date. The system will soon be extended to record and control all refund claims. Administration of refunds will also be refocused to ensure that all first-time refund claims above a minimum amount are subject to audit. Moreover, the GST Department will prepare and implement a new audit plan to ensure appropriate coverage of GST taxpayers, using a range of audit techniques and reducing excessive reliance on comprehensive audits. 17. Regarding expenditures, the government will limit budget expenditure in line with the developments in revenue collection with a view to achieving the deficit target under the program. Operationally, this would entail cuts in capital and recurrent outlays from the budgeted levels but still allow for increases in real terms. The stipulated expenditure cuts will be enforced by the Ministry of Finance through limits on expenditure authorizations throughout the year. Notwithstanding the expenditure cuts, we will increase the monthly allowances for civil servants and pensioners by JD 5 in order to compensate them for the above-mentioned price adjustments. The total annualized cost of this measure will be JD 15 million. In addition, the government under the PSET will increase cash transfers to the poor by JD 28 million (0.4 percent of GDP) on an annualized basis by broadening the coverage of the income transfer program and introducing a supplementary cash transfer program. We expect that these measures will adequately protect the poor from the price increases mentioned above. 18. The fiscal measures discussed above are intended to achieve the government’s fiscal target, while at the same time reducing distortions in the economy and stimulating growth. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7l- ATTACHMENT I ATTACHMENT The imposition of GST on previously exempted and zero-rated items will improve the structural integrity of the GST system, which is one of the least distortionary ways of raising revenues. Moreover, the adjustment in petroleum prices will bring domestic prices closer to world market prices. The liberalization of prices of animal feed will allow the private sector to provide these products more efficiently; and the reduction in customs tariffs will provide a stimulus to the domestic economy by enhancing competitiveness, and possibly also help to reduce domestic prices. At the same time, the much larger social sector program to be financed through the government budget and the PSET is designed to enhance labor productivity, as well as to help the population adjust to the changes in prices through targeted assistance to those most in need. 19. As regards spending under the PSET, the government has decided that execution of projects will only be initiated when financing for them has been reasonably secured. In this respect, prioritization of projects will be crucial given that financing may not be initially available to cover the full program; also, the sharp increase in social programs may strain our implementation capacity, which will be carefully assessed before new projects are begun. In this regard, the government is working closely with the World Bank, which is reviewing the PSET, to prioritize its social sector programs and evaluate implementation capacity. At the request of the government, the World Bank has agreed to identify four technical experts to assist the government in the areas of education, health, vocational training and public sector reform, and in capacity building of the relevant implementation agencies. PSET spending will be managed by the Ministry of Finance through the normal budget procedures and executed through the treasury system. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy 20. Monetary policy will continue to support the fixed exchange rate anchor. We believe that the current peg to the U.S. dollar has served Jordan well, bringing inflation down to industrial country levels and fostering confidence in the Jordanian dinar. The strong export growth in 2001 provides assurance that, despite some real appreciation of the U.S. dollar in recent years, competitiveness is adequate. However, we will continue to maintain a comfortable international reserve position, and stand ready to protect reserves and monetary stability through an active interest rate policy. The monetary program for 2002 is consistent with the objective of continued price stability and will also allow for healthy growth in private sector credit. We tentatively expect broad money to grow by about 10 percent in 2002, slightly more than projected nominal GDP growth, as a result of ongoing financial deepening. Reserve money is likely to grow at about the same rate. However, consistent with our approach to interest rate policy, we will limit the growth in NDA sufficiently to achieve the targeted international reserve position. 21. As part of an ongoing process of implementing the provisions of the new banking law that came into effect in August 2000, we will shortly be issuing regulations and guidelines: (i) strengthening the penalties, including fines, for violations of central bank regulations; (ii) limiting the total holding of shares by banks to no more than 50 percent of subscribed capital (the previous limit was 75 percent of owners’ equity), with a subceiling of 10 percent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 72 - ATTACHMENT I ATTACHMENT of subscribed capital for holdings of shares in an individual company; and (iii) strengthening guidelines on banks’ internal control systems. In addition, we are: (iv) fine tuning our procedures for evaluating banks’ risk weighted assets for the purposes of determining capital adequacy requirements; and (v) increasing the frequency and effectiveness of on-site supervision. Structural Reform 22. As part of the PSET, we will accelerate and broaden the privatization program. For 2002, we are in the process of completing the privatization of the cement company. We also plan to sell a part of the Jordan Potash Company and the Food Silos Company to strategic investors, and a portion of the government’s share in Jordan’s Telecommunication Company through the stock market. As regards the power sector, the government has separated the activities of the generation, transmission, and distribution companies created in 1999; and established an effective regulatory body for the industry. We have also selected the legal, technical and financial consultants for the privatization strategy. The regulatory and tariff regime for the electricity sector will be approved by the government in the second half of the year. With the completion of these steps, the stage will be set for privatizing the generation and distribution companies in 2003. We will also continue to hold discussions with interested parties on a strategic alliance for Royal Jordanian and its eventual privatization, which had been put on hold in the aftermath of the September 11 events. 23. The government is aware that the rapid growth in pension payments and future liabilities can only be contained through speedy implementation of pension reforms for the military and civil service. Accordingly, pension reform is a critical element of our medium- term fiscal strategy, and the recent Cabinet decision to enroll all new military personnel with the SSC under a contributory pension plan constituted an important first step. We have undertaken actuarial analysis to evaluate the long-term financial implications of various policy options with technical support from a fiscal expert from the IMF beginning in January 2002 in consultation with the World Bank. We intend to evaluate the technical assessments and recommendations of the Fund expert, and expect to present a comprehensive reform strategy to the Cabinet later in the year. We will also review the recommendations of the recent ROSC mission on the data dissemination module and develop an action plan, with a view to meeting the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standards in the next two to three years. 24. Recent developments in petroleum prices in the world market have underscored the need for establishing a closer link between the domestic prices of petroleum products and the associated import cost, so as to promote efficient energy use and insulate the budget from large fluctuations in petroleum-related revenue. Accordingly, in addition to the upward adjustments in petroleum prices discussed above, the government will continue to review quarterly the domestic prices of petroleum products to protect the level of petroleum-related revenues assumed in the program.

Consistent with the discussion in Section II, cabinet approval and implementation of the fiscal measures listed in Table 1 will be prior actions for staff to recommend Board consideration of the current reviews. We will consult with the Fund staff regarding developments that may affect external financing and grants, and any other significant deviation from the program.

Prior Actions for Staff to Recommend Board Consideration of Fourth and Fifth Reviews under Extended Arrangement The following measures are to be taken prior to Executive Board consideration of the reviews: 1. The government will introduce a two percent GST rate and apply it on currently exempted and zero-rated products. 2. The government will increase the following petroleum product prices: l Fuel oil for electricity from JD 60.4 per ton to JD 70 per ton; a Fuel oil for industry from JD 72 per ton to JD 77 per ton; a LPG price from JD 2.4 to JD 2.5 per LPG gas bottle. 3. The government will pass a cabinet decision to increase kerosene and diesel prices by June 1, 2002 from 110 fils to 120 fils per liter. 4. Customs tariffs on industrial product imports will be reduced to 3 percent from rates varying from 5 percent to 10 percent. 5. The price of chaff and barley will be liberalized, as indicated by an increase from the current levels (JD 60 per ton and JD 75 per ton, respectively) to levels consistent with best available market prices.
