The parliament selected Prime Minister Thein Sein, the head of the USDP, as the President.  Focus of the consultation: Discussions centered on key priorities to secure macroeconomic stability and steps to build capacity for future macroeconomic and structural reforms.1 Key policy issues and recommendations: With the recovery firmly in place, macroeconomic priority is to stop deficit monetization to defuse inflation pressures. A range of reforms are needed to help lift growth and living standards. These include unifying the exchange rate; strengthening macroeconomic management; generating fiscal space for social and infrastructure spending; improving investment climate; encouraging financial sector development; and further liberalizing agriculture and trade. The authorities concurred with most of the staff’s recommendations; and expect that the political transition under way would allow some economic liberalization, beginning with the unification of the exchange rate.  Exchange rate arrangement: Myanmar continues to avail itself of transitional arrangements under Article XIV, although it has eliminated all Article XIV restrictions. Myanmar maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. The exchange regime is classified as other managed arrangement.     _______________ 1 Discussions took place in Nay Pyi Taw and Yangon from January 12–26, 2011. The staff team comprised Ms. Karasulu (Head), Ms. Duma (all APD), Mr. Lönnberg (MCM), Ms. Funke (FAD), and Mr. Fievet (STA). Ms. Vongpradhip and Ms. Hla (OED) participated in policy meetings. As in previous Article IV missions, World Bank and Asian Development Bank staff joined the discussions.

INTRODUCTION 1.      The economy weathered the global crisis relatively well and has largely recovered from Cyclone Nargis. Given the absence of significant trade and financial linkages with advanced countries, Myanmar was relatively insulated from the direct impact of the global crisis. Prior to the crisis and Cyclone Nargis, real GDP growth averaged 4½ percent over the past five years. At 3½ percent in FY 2008/09, the decline in growth was modest compared to regional peers.  2.      However, long-standing distortions continue to constrain growth and development. Myanmar’s living standards remain the lowest in the region. Frequent episodes of hyperinflation over the past 10 years, mainly due to monetization of the deficits, have depressed purchasing power. Weak fiscal revenues and inadequate spending prioritization have curtailed development spending. Limited access to finance, poor infrastructure and human capital, and a nontransparent business climate have hampered economic development. As a result, growth remains narrow-based, and offers limited benefits to the majority of the population. 3.      Myanmar is at a historic crossroads with the political transition under way. Myanmar held general elections on November 7, 2010—its first in 20 years. The military-backed USDP won absolute majority and selected Prime Minister Thein Sein, the head of the party, as the President. Despite continuity in leadership, domestic expectations are high that the political transition could allow some economic liberalization.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS: EMERGING FROM THE GLOBAL RECESSION Background 4.      The economy is bouncing back, helped by the regional recovery, but inflation is on the rise. After falling to about 3½ percent in FY 2008/09, growth has picked up to around 5 percent in FY 2009/10, as the effects of Cyclone Nargis and spillovers from the global crisis fade away. Inflation accelerated to 7.2 percent (y/y) in October 2010 from a low of 2 percent in Q3 of FY 2009/10 due to rising commodity prices and a higher fiscal deficit. Gross international reserves grew to US$5.2 billion in FY 2009/10 (about eight months of import cover), largely owing to stronger exports and robust Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Staff’s Views 5.      The recovery is firmly in place. Growth is projected to reach 5.3 percent in FY 2010/11 and stabilize at 5½ percent in FY 2011/12 as the regional recovery continues and domestic investment picks up with privatization and robust construction activity. As international food prices continue to climb, CPI inflation is projected to reach 7½ percent at end-FY 2010/11. Private sector imports remain artificially suppressed due to exchange controls,1 limiting the impact of the recent nominal exchange rate appreciation in dampening imported inflation. This and current policies to continue deficit monetization would lead inflation to increase to 8½ percent at end-FY 2011/12. With continued large inflows to the energy sector,                                                  1 Private imports could be financed only by private export proceeds. international reserves are expected to remain comfortable. 6.      Near-term risks are tilted to the downside. A slower-than-projected recovery in key trading partners could reduce exports and investment inflows, and a higher fiscal deficit could further fuel inflation pressures. Weather-related shocks could also have a negative impact on growth. Myanmar is expected to remain in debt distress due to substantial external arrears.2 On the upside, expectations for economic change could improve confidence and lead growth to pick up further.  7.      Over the medium term, ambitious reforms are needed to realize Myanmar’s potential. Its rich natural resources, young labor force, and proximity to the most dynamic economies in the region point to a substantial growth potential. Wide-ranging reforms are needed to realize this potential, including unifying the exchange rate; strengthening macroeconomic management; generating fiscal space for social and infrastructure spending; improving business and investment climate; financial sector development; and further liberalizing agriculture and trade.                                                     2 A low-income debt sustainability analysis (LIC-DSA) was conducted by IMF staff only, since IDA has no financial relationship with Myanmar. The DSA finds that Myanmar is in debt distress due to external arrears and rising real interest rate on public debt.

The authorities consider the economy to have been growing at double digits over the past decade. According to their estimates, real GDP growth in FY 20010/11 is expected to reach 10½ percent, continuing the trend of 10 to 13 percent growth over the last 10 years. Nonetheless, the authorities acknowledged the deficiencies in their national account statistics, which by and large exclude private sector transactions that account for about 90 percent of domestic economic activity. They noted recent efforts to improve their GDP estimates, in line with past IMF technical assistance (TA) recommendations, and in collaboration with the UNDP.   III.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS: IMPROVING MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND BROADENING GROWTH A.   Fiscal Management: Ensuring Sustainability and Supporting Growth  Background 9.      The fiscal deficit widened, mainly due to higher spending. The consolidated public sector fiscal deficit increased by about 2 percentage points to 5.4 percent of GDP in FY 2009/10 as spending rose with a civil servant wage hike before the elections3 and higher-than-budgeted capital expenditure for the ongoing construction of Nay Pyi Taw (the new capital). The deficit in FY 2010/11 is projected to increase further to 5.7 percent of GDP as spending on the capital would be only partially offset by higher revenues. With construction of the capital having peaked, the deficit is projected to come down to 5 percent of GDP in FY 2011/12. 10.      Routine deficit monetization remains the main financing tool.  For the first time in FY 2009/10 the authorities financed about one-third of the deficit through treasury bonds. Nonetheless, the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) finances the residual                                                  3 The first increase since 2006. through purchases of treasury bills. All nominal interest rates are determined administratively and the treasury yields are set below the deposit rate, providing no incentive to banks to hold more bonds than they are required to satisfy reserve requirements. Staff’s Views 11.      With the recovery firmly in place and inflation pressures rising, stopping deficit monetization is an immediate priority. The increase in the fiscal deficit, driven mainly by the construction of the new capital, is translating into higher inflation, without broad-based growth benefits. Establishing a treasury bond auction to tap domestic savings would stop deficit monetization. Until this can be achieved, an adjustment of the relative interest rate structure—on bank deposits and treasury bonds—would allow for absorption of more treasury bonds by banks (see also section B). In this regard, the introduction of a two-year treasury bond in 2010; increasing the yield on other government bonds; and allowing a state bank to hold treasury bonds are positive steps. Staff also welcomed Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 6   allowing OTC trading of treasury bonds in the secondary market, albeit at fixed rates, and urged expediting the implementation of the roadmap of the Capital Market Development Committee, including for further development of government securities markets.  12.       Reorienting fiscal spending to development goals is needed to support broad-based growth. Increasing education and health spending, which remains very low by international standards, is necessary to improve human capital. A well-targeted transfer system to the poor in the medium term would help reduce widespread poverty. Capital spending should also shift to productive infrastructure projects to support broad-based growth, especially for rural development and power generation. Introducing a result-based evaluation system for infrastructure projects is needed to improve efficiency of capital spending. 13.      Generating fiscal space for development spending would require reforms to tax policy and tax administration. The revenue to GDP ratio, at 7 percent of GDP, is the lowest in the world.  More development spending would require lifting revenues by improved tax policies that emphasize direct taxation over indirect taxes to protect the poor, and modernization of tax administration, including a consistent application of tax policies. Plans to provide tax education; increase the income tax threshold (from the equivalent of US$25); and introduce self-assessments and single tax payer identification, are welcome. There is also room to improve revenues from indirect taxes. The complicated tax structure and weak tax administration encourage tax avoidance. Plans to simplify the commercial tax structure could usefully include replacing the commercial tax by a general sales tax with a single general tax rate and, at most, one reduced (or zero) tax rate for basic food items. The planned change would also be an opportune time to eliminate the recently introduced withholding tax on sales,4 which is difficult to administer. 14.      Planned decentralization would require strengthening fiscal management to contain risks to fiscal sustainability. The extent of the envisaged decentralization under the new constitution appears limited,5 and can contribute to improving fiscal accountability, if accompanied by strengthened fiscal management. This will require appropriate institutional arrangements, including properly defined regional spending responsibilities, intergovernmental revenue arrangements, borrowing controls, and improving capacity for budget preparation and management at both national and regional levels. 15.      Staff recommended fiscal consolidation toward a balanced budget in the medium term. Under current policies, the fiscal deficit is expected to remain at around 3½ percent in the medium term. Given the reliance on natural resource depletion for revenues, a broadly balanced budget in the medium term would be more appropriate,                                                  4 The withholding tax is levied on sales of goods, where the buyer is responsible for withholding and verification with the tax authority that the tax has been paid, before concluding the purchase. 5 The new constitution foresees delegating legislative power on some property use and excise taxes (less than 5 percent of consolidated government revenues) to states and regions, as well as some social spending responsibilities. However, there are no deficit limits on subnational governments.

These revenues should be used for productive capital spending within a sustainable fiscal framework, and consideration should be given to begin saving part of them for future generations and to ensure fiscal sustainability.  16.      Privatization efforts are welcome and should continue with improved transparency. Ensuring that the remaining state economic enterprises (SEEs) operate on a commercial basis would help address their declining profitability and allow for further privatization, while increasing transparency in privatization would improve confidence and valuations.   The Authorities’ Views 17.      The authorities concurred with staff’s recommendations but pointed out some constraints. They acknowledged that it was not profitable for banks to buy treasury bonds at current yields. While they concurred with staff advice, they noted that establishing a treasury auction is a medium-term goal that would require TA. They also broadly agreed with staff ‘s fiscal projections and noted that with the completion of Nay Pyi Taw more social spending would be possible, but the formulation of a new medium-term fiscal anchor would await the new government. They also agreed that the new withholding tax is complicated to administer and would consider revisions.  B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies: Building Central Banking Capacity and Moving Toward Exchange Rate Unification Background 18.      Institutional weaknesses limit the conduct of monetary policy. The CBM is not independent, has no explicit monetary anchor, and pervasive controls on banks impede the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Administratively set nominal interest rates have remained frozen at their 2006 levels, when inflation was above 38 percent. As a result, real interest rates remain   among the highest in the world, despite the recent rise in inflation.  19.      The currency regime maintains multiple exchange rates and current and capital account restrictions. The official exchange rate has been pegged at 8.5 kyat per SDR since 1977 and the official Foreign Exchange Certificate (FEC) rate6 has been stable around 5.5 kyat per U.S. dollar. The parallel market exchange rate (at 830 kyat per U.S. dollar in mid-January 2011) has appreciated by about 17 percent since end-                                                 6 The CBM has issued FECs since 1993, which are used by international organizations, residents, and companies for large transactions and are not convertible to U.S. dollars. There is also a parallel market for the kyat vis-à-vis both the U.S. dollars and the FEC. See the selected issues paper (SM/07/369) for a description of the multiple exchange rate regime. -3036912Lao P.D.R.NepalBangladeshVietnamPNG *Sri LankaCambodiaMongoliaMyanmarReal Interest Rates  1/(In percent, October 2010)Sources: Data provided by authorities; and IMF staff estimates.1/  Lending rates.*  Papua New Guinea.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 8   FY 2009/10 in nominal terms and by about 28 percent in real effective terms due to large inflows to the energy sector. The official exchange rates (both the official and the FEC rate) are overvalued, and a CGER-type analysis—subject to unusual margin of uncertainty—showed that the weighted exchange rate is also somewhat overvalued.7  Staff’s Views 20.      Administratively set interest rates are impeding countercyclical monetary management. Monetary policy is driven by deficit financing needs, as the government cannot sell sufficient bonds to private banks at current yields.8 Although from a cyclical perspective an interest rate increase would normally appear appropriate, in the absence of a proper transmission mechanism and any market-determined interest rates, and until a treasury bond auction can be established, lowering the deposit rate at commercial banks slightly below the treasury bond rates                                                  7 An assessment using weights on the official and market FEC exchange rates of about 60 and 40 percent reflecting the shares of public and private sector exports, respectively, indicates some overvaluation (11½ percent) from a single country model of the macrobalance approach, while the external stability approach and a macrobalance approach based on coefficients from a cross-country model point to a slight undervaluation (0.5–4¾ percent). Another assessment using weights of 8 and 92 percent based on shares of GDP by public and private ownership, respectively, point to a modest overvaluation (3 percent) from a single country model of the macrobalance approach, while the external stability and macrobalance approach based on a cross-country model indicate some undervaluation   (1–5½ percent). 8 The CBM routinely buys treasury bills at 4 percent interest rate to finance the deficit.  Private banks are not allowed to hold treasury bills, but bonds only, while public banks, with one recent exemption, are not allowed to hold either. would provide financial incentives to banks to hold treasury bonds, thereby addressing deficit monetization. Due to the deposit-to-capital requirement,9 private banks are already reverting to noninterest bearing promissory notes to accept deposits, hence an adjustment in the deposit rate would not materially impact deposits.  21.      Staff reiterated the need for early preparations for exchange rate unification, consistent with Myanmar’s commitments in 2011 under the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint. The unification of the exchange rate would strengthen the fiscal balance;10 lift growth by expanding external trade and reducing incentives for informal activities; help better evaluate SEE performance; and improve investor confidence. The authorities’ pragmatic approach to allow greater use of the market exchange rate should help smooth the transition to a market-determined exchange rate. In this regard, allowing recently the use of all foreign currency earnings—in addition to private export earnings—for private imports is commendable. However, preparations for exchange rate unification take considerable time, and the authorities should request TA as soon as possible to lay the groundwork to meet their commitment to accept Article VIII. Preparations would include putting in place a legal framework and the financial infrastructure for a foreign exchange market; and replacing the implicit subsidies on SEE                                                  9 The deposit-to-capital ratio, which limits deposit-taking from the general public to 10 times of paid up capital, applies only to private banks. 10 The staff estimates that exchange rate unification, on impact, would improve the fiscal balance by around 0.3 percent GDP. This does not include other efficiency gains from exchange rate unification, which could be significantly higher.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 9   imports arising from the use of the official exchange rate with explicit subsidies in the budget.  22.      A well-defined monetary policy framework is a necessary complement to exchange rate unification. This should be achieved through a revision of the central bank law to give operational autonomy to the CBM, with a clearly defined primary objective of domestic price stability, appropriate instruments to achieve its goal, and proper accountability. Until such reforms can be implemented, the CBM should begin building capacity to conduct monetary policy consistent with changing economic conditions, including by transferring all central banking functions from state banks to the CBM. The Authorities’ Views 23.      The authorities acknowledged the need to improve the interest rate structure.  They welcomed staff’s recommendations and noted that they will incorporate them into the deliberations of the recently formed interest rate study group to advise the new government.  24.      The authorities expect that unification of the exchange rate could be a priority for the new government. The CBM prepared a multiyear plan for exchange rate unification to submit to the new government, which envisages an adjustment of the official exchange rate, but would not abolish it.  The authorities broadly agreed with staff that revisions to the plan would be needed to ensure a proper exchange rate unification and are planning to request TA, once a political commitment is obtained. C. Financial Sector Policies: Removing Obstacles to Financial Intermediation Background 25.      Myanmar’s financial sector remains small and repressed with overly restrictive controls on financial intermediation. The deposit-to-capital ratio and onerous collateral requirements are key impediments although administrative controls and government influence also limit formal financial intermediation.11 As a result, there is a (reportedly) large unregulated and unsupervised shadow banking system. There is also uneven regulatory and supervisory treatment of state-owned and private commercial banks. Reporting standards and                                                  11 The CBM sets quantitative lending limits, interest rates on deposits and different loans, and maximum levels of bank fees and commissions. bank governance are poor, and banking supervision does not follow Basel Core Principles.  26.      Consistent with past staff advice, the authorities allowed for some financial liberalization. Fifty new bank branches were allowed, four new private banks were licensed, and the list of collateral was expanded to include three export crops and privatization assets. The authorities also doubled the credit facilities of the Myanma Agricultural Development Bank (MADB) and began experimenting with new financing methods in agriculture. These steps have improved access to credit and led to a sharp acceleration in private sector credit growth, albeit from a very low base (at 4½ percent of GDP credit to the private sector is returning to levels seen before the 2002–04 banking crisis). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 10   Staff’s Views 27.      Less restrictive credit policies are welcome and further liberalization should continue.  Additional funding to MADB would help provide more credit to eventually cover agricultural production costs.12 The recently introduced specialized rice companies and contract farming provide some additional credit in certain areas, but also carry the risk of monopsonistic practices if competition is not encouraged. Going forward, eliminating the impediments for private banks to expand in rural areas and introducing crop insurance to mitigate credit risk would increase competition. Further expansion of the list of acceptable collateral to include all crops and the issuance of land use certificates to farmers would increase available collateral.  28.      Financial sector modernization should remain a key component of Myanmar’s development strategy. The financial sector has considerable potential to support economic growth by further improving access to credit and increasing formal intermediation. Developing a functional transmission mechanism should start with price competition among banks to provide incentives to expand operations and help reduce informal banking. Before liberalizing interest rates, first steps could include liberalizing the deposit rates according to maturity—within the set maximum and minimum limits—and unregulating fixed commissions and fees. Allowing state banks to operate on a fully commercial basis would further foster competition. This would require first delineating their commercial operations, while moving their central banking functions                                                  12 MADB is the only bank allowed to lend to farmers and rations credit to cover only 25 percent of production costs. to the CBM, and their quasi-fiscal activities to the budget. Phasing out the deposit-to-capital requirement on private banks is essential to increase intermediation. With growing savings, state banks are receiving a larger portion of deposits,13 thus increasing their losses—due to lending restrictions—and undermining a competitive intermediation process. Allowing joint ventures with foreign financial institutions would help transfer technology in the context of ASEAN financial integration goals by 2015. 29.      Financial liberalization efforts should be complemented with a stronger regulatory and supervisory framework. Eliminating regulatory and supervisory forbearance, strengthening fit-and-proper and conflict-of-interest requirements, and moving to internationally accepted definitions for loan classification and provisioning are needed. In this regard, implementations of the 2008 TA recommendations on banking supervision and regulation remain a priority. The planned introduction of electronic banking products and an Automatic Clearing House are important steps to improve financial infrastructure. The Authorities’ Views 30.      The authorities recognize the need to modernize the financial sector, but prefer a more gradual approach. Nonetheless, they indicated their commitment to further raise credit to the agricultural sector over the medium term, and their plan to further expand the list of acceptable collateral.                                                   13 State banks are not subject to the deposit-to-capital requirement.

Despite its rich potential, Myanmar has fallen behind its regional peers in fostering broad-based economic growth and poverty reduction. The economy largely depends on two sources of growth—agriculture and energy.14 The agricultural sector’s development is suppressed by poor access to credit, lack of private land ownership, inadequate infrastructure, and inputs. The energy sector has surpassed agriculture as a source of export revenues and its importance will increase with forthcoming natural gas projects (Box 1). However, its growth dividend is limited, as it is exclusively under state control and is largely isolated from the domestic economy. Despite the low wage advantage, manufacturing sector remains stifled by poor infrastructure and technology, low investment, and an uncertain business climate.15  32.      While progress has been made in liberalizing the trade regime, Myanmar’s trade openness remains below that of regional peers (Box 2). Myanmar has met the implementation schedule under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) Common Effective Preferential Tariff scheme eliminating tariffs on about 61 percent of imports from ASEAN. While FDI is encouraged in the energy sector, investment in other sectors is limited, as approval procedures lack transparency.                                                   14 Agriculture accounts for about 40 percent of GDP, one-fourth of exports, and over one-half of total employment.  15 Myanmar ranks 175 out of 179 countries in the Economic Freedom Index of the Heritage Foundation. Staff’s Views 33.      Agricultural development remains essential for sustainable and broad-based growth. The government’s focus on private sector-led agricultural growth is welcome, and should continue with further liberalizing input and output markets, enhancing access to improved seeds, fertilizers, and machinery, and encouraging crop diversification. Accelerating broad-based rural growth is essential to reduce poverty. This requires complementary public investment in roads, education, and health services. 34.      Further trade liberalization should continue and focus on nontarriff barriers. The removal of remaining nontariff barriers, for example, by eliminating trade licensing should be expedited. Adopting internationally accepted customs valuation systems and use of import prices, instead of local wholesale market prices, would ensure effective MFN tariff rates for non-ASEAN imports.  35.      Promoting private sector development would require concerted efforts to improve the business climate. Priorities include reducing policy uncertainty; providing a level playing field; and reducing licensing and registration costs.16 Encouraging   ______________________ 16 Myanmar has the highest cost in the world for starting a business, encouraging informal sector activity.

Elimination of foreign exchange controls would be a key step for this, besides moving to a negative list for restricted FDI. Authorities’ Views 36.      The authorities recognize the importance of agriculture for broad-based growth. To mitigate the risks from climate change, they are focusing on improving productivity through better inputs, diversification of crops, and irrigation. They also plan further increases in agricultural credit. 37.      The authorities intend to continue with gradual trade liberalization. The removal of tariff barriers is progressing as planned, and the authorities target 2018 for the removal of nontariff barriers, in line with their ASEAN commitments. Adopting internationally accepted customs valuation systems remains under review. The authorities view special economic zones as a way to promote private sector development, especially in manufacturing.    Box 1. The Growing Importance of the Energy Sector1 The energy sector is becoming increasingly more important for Myanmar. Proven natural gas reserves are estimated at 23 trillion cubic feet—more than 46 years of current production—placing Myanmar at number 30 in the world. Natural gas exports (40 percent of total exports) and growing FDI to the sector are important sources of foreign exchange. Most natural gas exports go to Thailand through three pipelines. Two new projects, mainly directed to the Chinese market, are expected to come on line in 2014, and would almost double gas exports. However, natural gas revenues do not contribute significantly to the domestic economy. The government earns revenues through royalties, profits from its share in the gas projects, and income tax (US$1.5 billion in FY 2009/10). These revenues are recorded at the official exchange rate in the fiscal accounts, accounting only for 0.42 percent of revenues. If converted at the market exchange rate, their share would rise to about 75 percent of total revenues, some of which could be utilized to reduce the fiscal deficit and increase social spending. The positive spillovers to the domestic economy are further limited by the low local content in investments due to high technology and skill requirements.  Transparency in the sector would improve investor confidence and fiscal accountability. Participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) would contribute to transparency and could help attract more FDI.  Exchange rate unification remains essential for fiscal transparency. _______________ 1 Based on inputs by Alfredo Perdiguero (Asian Development Bank).

Myanmar – Shifting Trade Patterns1  Myanmar remains a relatively closed economy mainly due to economic sanctions. The share of exports to advanced economies declined to 13 percent in 2009 from 56 percent in 2000. Exports to the United States, mainly garments, stopped after the 2003 sanctions, while exports to Europe also dwindled. Similarly, the share of Myanmar’s imports from advanced economies dropped from 49 percent in 2000 to 28 percent in 2009.  Trade with regional partners has, however, accelerated and is filling some of the void left by advanced economies. Since joining the ASEAN in 1997, Myanmar’s trade with its neighbors has doubled, increasing the share of regional trade in GDP from 18 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2009.  The change in trading partners also resulted in a shift in the composition of exports. Natural gas emerged as the leading export good, while manufacturing exports (mainly garments) shrunk. In the process, Myanmar emerged as a significant natural gas exporter in the region, especially for Thailand. India remains a major market for Myanmar’s agricultural exports. Trade with China has also increased significantly in recent years, accounting for 10 percent of exports in 2009 and 35 percent of imports. Myanmar’s participation in regional free trade agreements will increase its regional integration. The ASEAN and China-ASEAN free trade agreements will allow more low-tariff access to regional markets. In turn, Myanmar will have to eliminate tariffs on most Chinese and ASEAN products by 2015. The Shwe natural gas project, expected to come online in 2014, will further increase natural gas exports to China through a pipeline.        _______________ 1 Prepared by To-Nhu Dao (APD).    04080120160BangladeshNepalSri LankaMyanmarLao P.D.R.CambodiaMongoliaPNGVietnamMyanmar: Trade Openess(In percent of GDP)19902009Sources: World Economic Outlook; and IMF staff calculations.01020304050USSingaporeEuropean UnionASEAN-4 1/JapanChinaIndiaThailandMyanmar: Share of Exports by Destination(In percent of total exports)20002009Sources: Directionof Trade; and IMF staff calculations.1/ ASEAN-4 includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Vietnam. 01020304050SeafoodRiceTextilesNatural gasHardwoodCopperPrecious stonesMyanmar: Share of Exports by Commodity(In percent of total exports)20002009Sources: WITS; and IMF staff calculations.1/ ASEAN-4 includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Vietnam.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 14    IV.   OTHER ISSUES Staff’s Views 38.      Further efforts are needed to improve data quality, coverage, and transparency. The construction of a national business registry would help improve the coverage of private sector transactions in national accounts, commensurate with their increasing importance. Pending the establishment of an independent statistical agency in the medium term, strengthening the institutional arrangements to enhance collaboration between the data producing and compiling agencies are also important to improve data quality. Participation in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) would facilitate the dissemination of information on statistical practices. Efforts to publish more data on the internet should be followed with a more timely release of a larger set of economic indicators, including GDP and monetary statistics.  39.      Implementation of Fund TA recommendations remains inadequate. Recommendations of the 2008 TA on banking supervision and regulation are still largely not implemented. Limited progress has been achieved since the last TA mission on national accounts and price statistics. However, the recent efforts to improve estimates of GDP by expenditure categories are encouraging. A track record of good progress in implementation will be important to ensure further TA support in these areas. 40.      Resolving external arrears is essential for debt sustainability and would send a positive signal to the international community. There has been no progress toward clearing arrears to multilateral and bilateral creditors (estimated at US$3.9 billion in FY 2009/10, of which about 73 percent are to bilateral creditors). The comfortable level of international reserves, augmented with the recent SDR allocation, provides room for resolving some of the external arrears. 41.      Recent steps would help strengthen the AML/CFT regime. The CBM improved regulations in line with FATF recommen-dations, while work to include insurance and securities operations under AML/CFT monitoring has been initiated. Formalizing closer cooperation with countries in the region through MOUs would further strengthen implementation capacity.  Authorities’ Views 42.      The authorities concurred with the staff’s assessment on data and TA implementation. They acknowledged the weak coverage of national account statistics, and noted that limited capacity and resources constrain TA implementation.  43.      The authorities see the resolution of arrears as part of a broader discussion that would include a review of sanctions. Thus, they do not envisage a rapid resolution. They also do not have any plans to use their SDR allocation.17       ______________________ 17 The authorities converted most of their recent SDR allocation (SDR 202.3 million) to change the compositon of their reserves.

Growth is expected to recover to 5.3 percent in FY 2010/11 and to 5½ percent in FY 2011/12 in line with regional recovery and robust construction activity. Inflation is projected to rise to 7.4 percent at end-FY 2010/11 and to 8½ percent in FY2011/12 due to deficit monetization and rising global food prices. Near-term risks to this baseline are tilted to the downside.  45. Stopping deficit monetization is a priority. The fiscal deficit is estimated to increase further to 5.7 percent of GDP in FY 2010/11 as construction of the new capital continues. Monetary policy is driven by deficit financing needs, as the government cannot sell sufficient bonds at treasury bond rates set below the deposit rate. Introducing a treasury bond auction to determine the interest rates is needed. Until then, lowering the deposit rate below the treasury bond rate would address deficit monetization, a key contributor to inflation. 46. Fiscal spending should focus on development goals. Spending on education and health, among the lowest in regional comparison, needs a boost to improve human capital.  Capital spending should be redirected to productive uses, especially in rural development and power generation, and with improved evaluation systems in implementing large infrastructure projects. 47. Reforms to tax policies and tax administration are needed to create fiscal space for more development spending. Lifting revenues would require tax policy revisions and better tax administration. Plans to increase the income tax threshold and introduce a single tax payer identification are welcome and should be strengthened by consistent application of tax laws. There is also room to improve revenues from the commercial tax, by broadening the base and simplifying its structure, while eliminating the overly complicated withholding tax on sales of goods.  48. Planned decentralization brings to the fore the need to strengthen fiscal management to ensure fiscal sustainability.  Establishing a treasury within the Ministry of Finance and Economy is needed to improve fiscal management. With decentralization, improving capacity for fiscal management at regional levels will be also important, including through institutional arrangements to delineate fiscal responsibilities.  49. Medium-term fiscal consolidation should target a balanced budget. Under the baseline scenario, the deficit is expected to remain at 3½ percent of GDP in the medium term. Although this is not excessive, the reliance on revenues from natural resource depletion point to a balanced budget as the appropriate fiscal anchor, in light of the vast development needs of the current generation. Productive capital spending with these revenues would support future growth and allow for savings for future generations, while ensuring fiscal sustainability.  50. Further steps are needed to strengthen private sector development and business climate.  Recent privatization of some SEEs are welcome, and should continue with improved transparency in privatizations. Remaining SEEs should be allowed to operate on a commercial basis. Improving the investment climate requires reducing policy Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 16   uncertainty and business start up costs, and providing a level playing field. Eliminating foreign exchange controls and moving to a negative list of restricted FDI would encourage more investment.  51. Time is ripe to prepare for exchange rate unification to meet Myanmar’s commitment in 2011 to accept Article VIII. Staff urges the authorities to seek TA to improve their plan for exchange rate unification and lay the groundwork, including by establishing a modern foreign exchange market with the necessary legal framework, and replacing the implicit subsidies to SEEs with explicit ones. Staff does not recommend the approval of the existing exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices because  there is no clear timetable for their elimination. 52. A more active monetary policy will require building central banking capacity. Before operational autonomy and accountability can be granted to the CBM through a revision of the CBM law, all central bank functions performed by state banks should be transferred to the CBM to build capacity to conduct monetary policy.   53. Financial sector modernization would contribute significantly to economic development. This would require allowing competition among banks by lifting pervasive administrative controls, including by gradually liberalizing the interest rates, commissions and fees, phasing out the deposit-to-capital ratio, and expanding the list of allowable collateral. The recent efforts to improve access to finance and direct more funding to agriculture should continue. Reorganizing state banks and allowing them to compete in their commercial operations with private banks would further foster competition.  Financial liberalization should be complemented with strengthened supervision and regulation, including by implementing the 2008 TA recommendations. 54. Further trade liberalization should focus on nontariff barriers. The authorities made good progress with reducing tariff rates and should adopt internationally accepted custom valuations to ensure MFN rates for non-ASEAN imports, and remove the remaining nontariff barriers, including trade licensing and export restrictions.   55. Improving data quality, coverage, and transparency requires further efforts. Data shortcomings, mainly due to capacity constraints, significantly hamper surveillance. A national business register is needed to improve the coverage of national account statistics. A broader effort to enhance cooperation between data compiling and producing agencies would help improve data quality, while subscribing to GDDS would facilitate capacity building.  A good track record of implementation in areas where TA has been provided would be needed to ensure future TA support.  56. Resolving external arrears is needed for debt sustainability. The authorities should resume discussions to this end. Including insurance and securities operations under AML/CFT monitoring and formalizing closer cooperation through MOUs with regional partners would strengthen implementation. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 17    Figure 1.
