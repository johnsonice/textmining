Introduction Cambodia is gradually emerging from years of turmoil and internal strife. The large-scale effort mounted by the international community over the past years has helped bring an initial measure of stability, and the process of rehabilitation and transition to a market economy is now well under way. The Fund was involved at an early stage and has been playing a leading role in providing technical assistance and financial support under the STF and the ESAF. When the ESAF arrangement was approved in May 1994 in conjunction with the 1994 Article IV consultation, I/ Directors called for tight financial policies to keep inflation in check, a substantial tax reform to raise revenue, and wide-ranging structural reforms. In light of Cambodia's legacy of devastation and in view of the risks stemming from the uncertain security environment, Directors also noted that the process of rehabilitation and reconstruction was likely to be protracted. Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation and on an economic program for 1995-96, to be supported by the second annual ESAF arrangement, were initiated in March and concluded in July 1995. 2/ They took place against a background of improved macroeconomic stability, but also emerging fiscal pressures owing in large part to continued high levels of spending u The Executive Board approved on May 6, 1994 a three-year ESAF arrangement for the equivalent of SDR 84 million (129 percent of quota) and a first loan disbursement of SDR 14 million under the first annual arrangement. The last Article IV consultation was concluded at the same time (EBM/94/41). See the staff report (EBS/94/76, 4/8/94 and Supplement 1, 5/12/94), the letter of intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (EBS/94/44, 3/g/94), the supporting Policy Framework Paper (EBD/94/64, 4/14/94) and the paper on Recent Economic Developments (SM/94/108, 5/2/94). The midterm review of the first annual arrangement was concluded on March 8, 1995 on a lapse of time basis (EBS/95/12, l/25/95, and Supplement 1, 3/2/95). 2/ The discussions were held with Mr. Keat Chhon, Senior Minister for Rehabilitation and Development and Minister of Economy and Finance, Mr. Thor Peng Leath, Governor of the National Bank of Cambodia, Mr. Cham Prasidh, Minister of Commerce, Mr. Chant01 Sun, Secretary of State for Finance, and Ms. Tioulong Saumura, Deputy Governor of the National Bank of Cambodia, as well as other senior officials and representatives of major bilateral agencies. The staff teams during the March 24-April 7 and July 8-18, 1995 missions included Messrs. M.G. Kuhn (head), U. Gunjal, R. Hagemann, W. Peng (EP), Ms. Y. Metzgen (all CTA), Ms. N. Happe (PDR), Mrs. L. Sahasranam (Administrative Assistant, CTA) and J. Charap (incoming Resident Representative). Mr. Ismael (ED) participated in the discussions during July 12-15, 1995. The missions were assisted by Mr. R. Vaez-Zadeh, Senior Resident Representative in Phnom Penh, and overlapped with missions of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

Issues of governance--related inter alia to forestry operations and foreign borrowing/investment contracts--were also a key part of the staff's discussions. To maintain financial discipline while meeting the higher expenditure requirements, the authorities adopted a supplementary budget package which includes substantial additional tax measures. The assurances secured for agreement on a program include a range of actions aimed at strengthening budgetary monitoring, transparency, and control to address the rising concerns about governance, particularly in the areas mentioned above. In the attached letter to the Managing Director and the accompanying Memorandum (Annex I), the authorities outline their policies for the period July 1995-June 1996, and request the second annual arrangement under the ESAF for an amount equivalent to SDR 28 million. A first disbursement of SDR 14 million would become available upon approval and the second disbursement upon completion of the midterm review. Cambodia's prospective Fund position during the period of the ESAF arrangement is presented in Appendix Table 1. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are expected to continue to play important roles in supporting Cambodia's rehabilitation program. Cooperation with Fund staff has been close. In addition to continued technical assistance and sectoral project loans, both institutions will also provide quick-disbursing balance of payments and budgetary support. The World Bank Board is expected to consider in September 1995 an Economic Rehabilitation Credit (for some $40 million), and the Asian Development Bank staff intends to present a program loan to its Board in early 1996 (Annexes V and VI). Cambodia provides the basic elements of the core economic data set to the Fund (Annex II). There are serious shortcomings in quality and timeliness of data, however, including incomplete coverage of balance of payments and national accounts statistics, but progress is being made in improving the data base, with technical assistance in all major areas from the Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the UNDP, and other multilateral and bilateral donors. II. Recent DeveloDments and Performance Under the 1994/95 Program I/ 1. Political and securitv background The political environment remains fragile. The Government, which took office following the UN-sponsored elections in May 1993, comprises a 1/ A longer-term perspective on Cambodia's development is contained in last year's report on Recent Economic Developments (SM/94/108, 5/2/94), which was subsequently published as Economic Review No. 8.

It has two Prime Ministers (one from each major party). The security situation, though improved, remains unsettled. The Government's policy of integrating Khmer Rouge defectors into the military appears to have had some success, but has also made progress toward effective de-mobilization more difficult. Land mines remain a serious problem in large parts of the countryside, despite continuing efforts at de- mining with the support of bilateral donors. 2. Macroeconomic develoDments A/ Macroeconomic performance during the first year of the ESAF-supported program was broadly favorable (Table 1 and Chart 1). Improved financial discipline resulted in an increasingly stable macroeconomic environment, as evident in the stability of the exchange rate after the wide fluctuations during previous years (Chart 2). Output growth in 1994--at 4 percent--was lower and less balanced than expected because of a weather-related sharp drop in rice production. 2/ Consumer prices rose by 18 percent during 1994 (final quarter basis), double the program target, largely as the result of the supply-related surge in food prices that was partly validated through an acceleration in liquidity growth during the latter part of the year. With the partial unwinding of food prices and continued fiscal and monetary restraint during early 1995, inflation subsided to an annual rate of less than 10 percent. Fiscal oolicv played a central role in maintaining financial stability during 1994 and early 1995. Despite significant overruns in spending on security and defense, the current fiscal deficit (on a cash basis) was kept to 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994, because of strong revenue performance and tight controls over nondefense spending (Appendix Table 4). Capital expenditure increased to 5 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 (from 4 l/2 percent in 1993) due to an acceleration of project aid flows. The overall fiscal deficit was entirely foreign financed; there was no recourse to domestic bank financing. lJ Assessments of macroeconomic developments remain complicated by the mixed quality of data. In view of the weakness of national income accounts data, magnitudes expressed as a ratio to GDP should be interpreted with caution. Care is also called for in interpreting time series developments, because continuing improvements in the quality and coverage of the statistical data base have led to pronounced breaks in a number of statistical series. 2J The rice shortfall was alleviated by commercial imports of rice in early 1995, combined with substantial additional food aid for the rural areas, largely distributed by nongovernmental organizations through food- for-work programs.

This increase reflects strong customs receipts and nontax revenue, including revenue from forestry operations (Box 1). Noncustoms tax revenue fell short of expectations, however, because of delays and modifications of a number of measures. Nondefense expenditures were compressed during 1994 to well below programmed levels. However, SDendinp. on securitv and defense--at 7 percent of GDP--turned out to be substantially higher than the estimate of 4 3/4 percent that was made late last year. This overrun partly reflects the surge in the price of rice, which comprises a significant portion of military wages. Most of the revision, however, reflects improved statistical coverage in the wake of strong, recent efforts by the Ministry of Economy and Finance toward greater transparency in military spending. These efforts led to reclassifications of expenditures made by other ministries on account of the military, and reinforced procedures to bring extrabudgetary transactions into the budgetary process. I/ The revised 1994 budget outcome also incorporates extrabudgetary expenditures financed by nonconcessional external borrowing which was discovered only recently. An external debt survey--initiated by the Ministry of Economy and Finance in April 1995 and completed three months later --revealed over $30 million in nonconcessional debt contracted during 1994, largely for the purchase and repair of military hardware. Disbursements from these contracts during 1994 amounted to nearly 3/4 percent of GDP, while the remainder (l/2 percent of GDP) was disbursed in early 1995. The amounts and terms of these external debt contracts-- which have a small adverse impact on Cambodia's debt service ratio over the period to 2000 (roughly 3 percent of exports on average)--were contrary to the Government's commitments under the first-year ESAF program, and the program ceilings on external debt were breached. Strict control procedures over the contracting of external debt have now been established (see Section 111.4). Monetary developments are difficult to assess given the high degree of dollarization and the uncertainties about underlying economic relationships. Developments in 1994 and early 1995 were broadly in line with the program (Appendix Table 5). The elimination of bank financing of the budget deficit permitted a substantial increase in credit to the private sector while keeping the expansion of net domestic assets well within the program I/ The fiscal outturn for 1994 presented in Appendix Table 4 includes extrabudgetary revenues of CR 20 billion that were not directly passed to the budget. These adjustments represent a partial accounting of extra- budgetary transactions that took place in mid-1994, when the military was temporarily given permission to export logs and retain part of the proceeds for self-financing of defense activities (see also Box 1).

Forestry policy over the past years has been &a@ by the need to reconcile three often conflicting considerations: l Environment: The pace of deforestation has become a prime environmental concern. Uncontrolled logging, mostly for exports, has reduced forest cover from around 74 percent of land area in the early 1970’s to an estimated 30-35 percent today. l Security: Timber exports remain an important source of income for the Khmer Rouge operating in the northwestern part of the country, and elements of the Cambodian military have also been involved in illegal log exports. . Exports and goverumenl revenue: Forestry operations have made important contri- butions to Cambodia’s balance of payments and budget. In 1994, logs and sawn timber are estimated to have accounted for over 80 percent of exports and 17 percent of budgetary revenue. Illegal exports are (partially) covered in these estimates--offset in the balance of payments largely by capital outflows--but a significant part of potential royalties and taxe:s were not pass& to the budget. A first moratorium on the export of unpro- cessed timber was adopted in September 1992 by the Supreme National Council of Cambodia; this action was taken over the ol?jwtions of the PDK (the party of the Khmer Rouge). The UN Secu- ritv Council requested “States, especially neighboring States, to respect this moratorium by not importing such logs.” 11 In October 1993, the new Government of Cambodia announced a temnorary lifting of the moratorium through end-1993 to allow the exports of logs that had been cut more than a year earlier. The period was subsequently extended to end-March, 1994. 21 Reimposed on April 1, 1994, the ban on exports was not fullv implemzd. In mid-1994 the Ministry of Defence was given responsibility for the licensing of log exports. The militaq was thus in a position to collect and dispose of the proceeds from timber without the supervision or control of other Ministries, including the Ministry of Finance. The Government announced in August 1994 that all logging activities would be banned from January 1, 1995, followed by a baa on exports of all processai and unprocessed timber on May 1, 1995. f-wt!-Y revenue during the first four months of 1995 from log exports amounted to CR 32 billions. The export ban took effect on Mav 1. 1995. Responsibility for enforcement rests with the Ministry of Agriculture, which can draw on the resources from other ministries. As a part of its new forestry policy, the Forestry Department of the Ministry of Agricul-ture has been conducting an inventory of already fellecl logs (estimated at around 500,000 cubic meters). These will be sold for domestic use through public tender. All revenues generated from these sales will be transferred to the Treasury. During 1994, the Government approved 11 lona- &rn forestry concessions covering a total area of 2 million hectares--roughly 28 percent of Cambodia’s remaining forests--including one large concession providing for a 30-year contract covering 787,810 hectares of forest. The export ban also affecb these logging concessions, at least until they have established a master plan for the environmentally sustainable management of the concessions (including replanting) co’nsistent with the Government’s new forestry code. This master plan will be based on the recommen&tions of the International Tropical Timber Association (Cambodia became a member in January 1995). 11 Security Council Resolution SIRES/792 (1992). November 30, 1992, paragraph 13 21 The procedures for log exports involved four Ministries (Agriculture, Commerce, Economy and Finance, and Fonign Affairs). Licenses were issued by the Ministries of Agriculture and Commerce. All log exports had to carry a Certificate (of Origin (CO), which was issued only after inspection and payment of the “standing timber charge” ($35 per cubic meter) and the export tax (at a rate of 10 percent of the estimated exporl value, equivalent to about $10 per cubic meter).

I/ The net foreign assets of the banking system more than doubled, largely reflecting inflows of bank capital as new banks were established. The growth of liquidity (including foreign currency deposits) was also faster than expected, with a further shift toward foreign currency domestic currency in circulation declined slightly. In order to encourage greater use of riel, the National Bank started to issue new coins and banknotes in larger denominations (the largest old bill has a value equivalent to $0.20) in March 1995. Revisions to the balance of payments have reflected efforts at widening the coverage of.trade transactions as well as securing more comprehensive data.on external financing (see Annex II for a brief updated assessment of the statistical base). Although the current account deficit as a percent of GDP remained about the same in 1994 as estimated at the time of the midterm review--about 12 percent of GDP, widening to about 14 l/2 percent in 1995-- both the trade and service balances are now more solidly based. Exports of goods and services in 1994 were boosted by forestry products, higher sales of rubber, and increases in tourism. The surge in imports reflects in large part an acceleration in aid-financed project implementation starting in the last quarter of 1994. Disbursements of grants and concessional loans from official sources, including grants disbursed through nongovernmental organizations which were previously not covered, reached $280 million in 1994, substantially above the original program estimate. Gross reserves of the National Bank exceeded the targeted amount, reaching the equivalent of 1 l/2 months of total imports of goods and services at end-1994, and have increased further since then. 3. Structural reforms Progress was also made in implementing the Government's agenda for structural reform, though there were delays in a number of areas compared with the initial schedule. Performance under the structural benchmarks is summarized in Appendix Table 3. On civil service reform, new rules for recruitment have been implemented, an initial count of civil servants was completed in February 1995, and a comprehensive census is now well under way with technical assistance from the UNDP and the World Bank. In the militarv, the number of generals was reduced from 1,876 to 147 and the number of divisions from 28 to 12, though these reductions have yet to yield significant cost savings, since salaries and benefits continue to be paid at the previous rank. Public enterprises play a relatively small part in Cambodia's economy as a result of previous reform measures. Following approval of the privatization law by the National Assembly in December 1994, the Government has adopted a comprehensive privatization strategy. The IJ The quantitative benchmarks on net domestic assets, net credit to the government, and credit to public enterprises for end-December 1994 and end- March 1995 were observed with comfortable margins (Appendix Table 2).

III. Policy Discussions Despite its remarkable progress over the past two years, Cambodia continues to face daunting near- and medium-term challenees. Per capita income is among the lowest in the world. Two decades of internal strife have severely depleted human resources, and physical infrastructure has suffered from years of destruction and neglect. Rehabilitation needs are massive, and Cambodia's administrative capacity remains weak. Against this background, the discussions on medium-term strategy and program nolicies revolved around three major themes: l the need to consolidate the recent macroeconomic eains and to ensure continued consistency in macroeconomic management by strengthening fiscal performance, improving transparency in government operations, and developing effective instruments of monetary policy. l the need to accelerate structural reforms, with particular focus on the civil service, the military, public enterprises, and the institutional and legal framework required for a well-functioning market economy. 0 the need to implement a balanced erowth strategy aimed at attracting private investment activities that contribute to sustainable economic development and complement the aid-supported public investment program. L/ The macroeconomic obiectives --set out in the updated PFP for 1995-97-- are consistent with the original ESAF framework and include: (i) raising the rate of output growth to about 7 percent a year in 1995 and the subsequent two years; (ii) reducing the rate of inflation to below 8 percent by mid-1996 and 5 percent by 1997; (iii) improving the fiscal position through a broadening of the tax base aimed at a durable increase in the revenue-to-GDP ratio; and (iv) increasing official reserves to 2 l/4 months lJ The growth strategy is founded not only on an increasing contribution of private investment over time, but also on balanced overall investment in both urban and rural areas, given the potential for productivity gains in agriculture after years of neglect. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - of import cover by the end of the program period in mid-1996. 1/ The current fiscal deficit is targeted at 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995, and should decline to 3/4 percent in 1996. Virtual avoidance of bank financing of the budget deficit will continue to provide the anchor for financial stability. The authorities will make the PFP publicly available to facilitate its wide distribution within the international community. The growth targets of the program are ambitious but feasible. Noting that growth in recent years has been largely confined to the Phnom Penh area, particularly in construction and services, the authorities stressed the need for a more balanced pattern of growth to lift incomes in rural areas and thus help accelerate the process of national reconciliation. Agriculture has considerable potential and relatively high growth could be sustained over the medium term, given the low intensity of land use. The authorities' emphasis on rural rehabilitation and the encouragement of private investment in agro-based processing is therefore appropriate, in parallel with the development of a modern sector based on labor-intensive light manufacturing and services. 2. Fiscal policies The authorities noted that the initial budget framework for 1995, adopted by the National Assembly in December 1994, had been overtaken by -developments during the first months of 1995. Intensified fiscal pressures were emanating from three main sources: the negative impact on budget revenue of a less depreciated exchange rate than initially anticipated; the prospective loss in revenue from forestry products following re-imposition of the ban on log exports; and significantly higher expenditures for defense and security than envisaged in the budget. The authorities agreed with the staff that decisive actions were needed on the revenue side to meet the targets for the budget deficit and for bank financing of the budget. The staff reiterated the key importance of transnarencv in government operations, noting in particular the concerns about budgetary revenues from forestry operations (including illegal timber operations) and commissions from foreign direct investment contracts. This issue and its implications for governance and, ultimately, for the success of the program, were discussed with the two Prime Ministers, including corrective measures. Acknowledging that past experience demonstrated the need for a significant strengthening of procedures in these areas, the authorities reconfirmed their commitments to conduct all government operations in a fully l/ The period of the program to be supported by the second annual ESAF arrangement is July 95-June 96.

Toward these ends, the authorities have formulated a wide range of measures (Box 2). Strict implementation of these measures should go a long way toward establishing effective budgetary transparency and control. The authorities have decided to introduce a series of new tax measures in the supplementary budget, to be submitted to the National Assembly in August 1995, and additional measures will be introduced in the context of the 1996 financial law (Box 3). These measures are projected to yield 1 l/2 percent of GDP on an annual basis. Their impact for the remain&r of 1995 will be more limited, and achievement of the 1995 revenue target will therefore hinge critically on the full and timely receipt of royalties in connection with two large foreign investment contracts and of the proceeds from the sale of already felled logs for domestic use. 1/ The tax package represents an important step toward reducing reliance on customs duties and broadening the domestic tax base, both key elements of the authorities' medium-term fiscal reform aeenda. From this perspective, and given recent improvements in tax administration, the staff had favored a larger increase in domestic taxes combined with lower initial taxation of petroleum products, as well as full implementation of the package as part of the supplementary budget. u The authorities argued that phasing was lJ As described in paragraph 13 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) (Annex I).

Budgetary Transparency and Control The Government intends to implement a wide range of measures to strengthen transparency in government operations and budgetary monitoring and control procedures, including: l Submission to the National Assembly of a draft law providing the legal basis for a drive against corruption and the establishment of a special independent commission; and submission of revised financial laws for 1994 and 1995 to bring into the budgetary process extrabudgetary transactions, including recent nonconcessional external borrowing. a Establishment of procedures to transfer to the budget in a timely manner all fees and taxes,arising from forestry operations and government contracts; and establishment of competitive bidding procedures for government projects and procurement. . Assignment of financial controllers to each ministry; establishment of a Public Inspector’s Office in the Ministry of Economy and Finance; and implementation of a direct payment system by the Treasury to suppliers for expenditures beyond a specified level. 0 Implementation of a comprehensive system for monthly reporting and monitoring of foreign investment flows, covering in particular tax exemptions and fees and royalties to be paid to the budget in connection with these investments. . Adoption of a new plan of accounts by the National Bank; and divestiture of its interests in the remaining joint venture banks and its own branches that engage in commercial banking activities. necessary in view of strong political resistance and the need to strengthen further the administrative capacity to implement higher domestic taxes. On expenditure policy, the authorities noted that their margin for maneuver was severely limited by ongoing defense and security requirements. As a consequence, it had not been possible to provide the budgeted funding for basic services and local currency counterparts to foreign-financed capital expenditure. The initial budget had targeted spending for defense and security at 4 percent of GDP, 3/4 percent below the previously estimated 1994 outcome. In light of developments during 1994 and continued high expenditures during the first months of the year, this target now appears out of reach. The revised budget aims at containing military spending at below 6 percent of GDP, L/ and a further reduction should be possible in 1996 in the context of military reform.

First, to raise the currently very low share of government revenues in GDP. Second, to restructure the composition of budgetary revenues to shift toward domestic taxation and away from taxes on international trade (which account for over two-thuds of revenues). Consistent with these objectives, the Government has decided to take a number of measures phased, aimed at increasing revenue by 1 l/2 percent of GDP on an annual basis by 1996 (see also Table 1 of tbe MEFP). These include: 0 an increase in revenues from duties on gasoline aud diesel, beginning late June 1995 (0.3 percent of GDP) 0 imposition of a 10 percent excise tax on selected goods, both imported and domestically produced, beginning September 1, 1995 (0.5 percent of GDP) 0 introduction of an ad valorem export tax on rubber (0.1 percent of GDP) 0 an increase in the excise tax on gasoline to 20 percent, beginning January 1996 (0.3 percent of GDP) l anincrease oftbe land 2percenttumover tax ratesto 4percent, beginning January 1996 (0.1 percent of GDP) l improvements in tax collection (0.1 percent of GDP) (pending implementation of the comprehensive civil service reform). _ _ There is, in particular, an urgent need to shift expenditures toward social services which accounted for only 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994. The supplementary budget for 1995 foresees a small increase in social expenditures, and the authorities intend to incorporate a more substantial shift in the 1996 budget. IJ Total capital expenditure is slated to increase to over 6 percent of GDP, largely financed by foreign aid. The authorities are aware that this increase will hinge critically on the timely availability of domestic currency counterpart funds and an appropriate prioritization of locally financed capital spending. In this context, the early formulation of a first Public Investment Program, with assistance from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, is of particular importance. lJ The World Bank intends to assist the authorities in conducting a public expenditure review starting in late 1996.

Fiscal developments will need to be monitored closely, however, and an interim review will be held with Fund staff in November 1995 with a particular focus on the fiscal program for 1996. Although contingency measures have been identified, the revenue options remain limited in the short run, and therefore the most likely consequence of budgetary slippage would be a cutback in the planned increase in non-defense spending; in this event, the staff has emphasized the importance of protecting basic services. 3.

The economy is highly dollarized, transactions continue to be effected mostly in cash, and private sector holdings of riel bank deposits remain almost nonexistent. u Most commercial banks deal nearly exclusively in foreign currency as regards both their liabilities and assets. The discussions focused on the crucial need for introducing and improving monetary control instruments, and strengthening banking regulation and supervision. The authorities agreed that a key objective of monetary policy should be to build, over time, a domestic currency monetary base. The monetary DroPram aims at a reduction in inflation to below 8 percent by the end of the program period. Liquidity growth is programmed to decline from 30 percent in 1994 to 17 percent by December 1995 and 15 percent by June 1996 (twelve month basis). A key element in containing liquidity growth will be effective control over bank financing of the budget deficit, the main source of riel creation. The small programmed increase in net credit to the government, combined with tight limits on credit to public enterprises, leaves room for a significant increase in bank credit to the private sector. The authorities observed that the recent successful introduction of larger denominations of riel bank notes, together with the broader financial sector reforms being undertaken, u would encourage wider use of the riel. They agreed with the staff, however, that a more expansionary stance at this juncture carried considerable risks, given the uncertainties about the underlying economic relationships, the high degree of dollarization and the absence of a well-developed set of monetary control instruments. The program therefore assumes only a modest increase in riel in circulation and in riel deposits. The National Bank has developed a plan for bank-by-bank credit ceilings to strengthen its ability to exert effective monetary control. To make the system as market-oriented as possible, the staff recommended that banks be allowed to trade excess room under their individual ceilings, and the authorities are considering this proposal. The authorities are also drawing up plans for the issuance of treasury bills beginning in late 1995, with technical assistance from the Fund. This should help establish a L/ While there are no reliable estimates of foreign currency in circulation, available evidence and cross-country comparisons suggest that the stock of foreign currency held by the public may be several times larger than the stock of domestic currency in circulation. 2/ As described in paragraph 20 of the MEFP.

The authorities have initiated a comprehensive review of individual commercial banks and are reinforcing their efforts to improve the regulation and supervision of the financial system, with technical assistance from the Fund. The legal basis for regulation and supervision is also being strengthened. The new central bank law is to be considered by the National Assembly in August 1995, and a new financial sector law will be submitted to the National Assembly by year-end. In the meantime, the National Bank is using its authority under the existing banking law to issue needed prudential regulations. Z!/ In spite of the large number of banks in Cambodia, banking offices do not exist outside of the few large cities. The authorities see the absence of rural credit as a significant constraint on increasing agricultural output and rural incomes. Plans for a rural credit program are currently being developed with technical assistance--to be followed by significant financial support--from a number of donors. In order to ensure that rural credit activities are consistent with overall financial stability, the National Bank will have regulatory and supervisory responsibilities, but will not extend preferential treatment. 4. External policies Balance of oavments projections for the program period point to widening of the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) to 14 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995 and nearly 15 percent in 1996 (Table 2 and Appendix Table 6). This widening reflects the sharp drop in exports of logs--following the ban as of May 1995--combined with a continuing rise in retained imports related to increased private direct foreign investment flows and higher disbursements of official development assistance. The projected growth in official aid mostly reflects improved utilization of the existing large pipeline and disbursements from expected lJ Banks are free to determine their own interest rates. The rates on three-month riel deposits offered by banks in April 1995 generally ranged from 5 to 18 percent, with a few banks continuing to offer a much higher interest rate, based on the previous National Bank guideline (apparently as a courtesy to long-time customers). Many banks do not quote riel deposit rates at all. L?/ As described in paragraphs 26 and 27 of the MEFP.

Commercial Banking System There are currently thirty commercial banks in Cambodia, of which nineteen are private (most are partly foreign-owned), six are branches of foreign banks, three are joint ventures in which the National Bank has a share, and two are state-owned banks (the Foreign Trade Bank and the Municipal Bank). This very large number of banks for a country of Cambodia’s size and stage of development places particular strain on banking supervision. Most of these banks had already been granted a preliminary license by end-1993, but a number of them had not started operations or had not fully paid up their author&d capital. In January 1994 the National Bank required banks not yet in operation to pay the full amount of their author&d capital into a special account at the National Bank by May 1994, with the funds subsequently available for withdrawal for use in the bank’s operations. Banks already in operation were required to bring their paid-up capital to the minimum required level. As a result, commercial bank capital increased sharply in 1994, most of which is believed to have been brought from abroad. Banking system reports show that most banks now meet the minimum capital requirement, and those that do not have been given until August 1995 to do so. There remain questions, however, about the accuracy of the reports tiled by banks. The nature of the operations of some banks that have not yet begun to take deposits or make loans has also raised concerns about their profitability and the possibility of money laundering. These concerns came into sharp focus in March 1995 when the National Bank discovered that one of the smaller banks had lost most of its capital through speculation in the U.S. commodity market. The National Bank decided to close the bank. Another bank has recently decided to close, apparently due to lack of business. The National Bank is currently undertaking a systematic review of each bank’s operations with the aim of identifying and eliminating any irregularities, including, if necessary, through further bank closures. new commitments of balance of payments assistance by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. lJ Based on estimates of official development assistance derived from information provided by major donors and cautious assumptions on private net capital flows, the projected external financing requirements for 1995 and 1996 are expected to be fully met.

Foreign Direct Investment Cambodia’s emerging political and macroeconomic stability, liberal foreign exchange and trade system, and the large unexploited opportunities after years of isolation have attracted substantial investor interest. Investors have also been attracted by a variety of tax incentives-duty exemptions, corporate tax holidays, extended loss-carry-forward provisions--as well as long-term contracts assuring exclusive rights in certain sectors. These incentives have been given on an ad hoc and temporary basis, pending adoption by the Government of administrative regulations for implementation of the Investment Law. Approval of foreign direct investment (FDI) pro.&% has been streamlined considerably under the new Law on Investment passed in August 1994. The Cambodia Investment Board (CIB)--one of the operational arms of the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC)--takes action within 45 days of receipt of an application. To-date the CIB has approved investment projects totalling approximately US$ 2.5 billion. Two large projects account for close to two thirds of the total approved. One involves US$ 1.3 billion to the Naga Island Resort center, the port and airport of Sihanoukville, and a casino in Phnom Penh. The other comprises US$VO million to expand and manage Phnom Penh airport for the next 20 years. For larger projects, the Government has shown a preference for revenue-sharing or BOT (build-operate-transfer) arrangements, and has in some cases sought up-front payments, such as in the two cases above. The Government has also entered into direct joint ventures or arrangements that build up the Government’s equity share from revenue-sharing, as in the case of the Cambodian airline. sustainable economic development, and emphasized that such projects should be consistent with the priorities of the public sector investment program. The staff also cautioned against undue reliance on fiscal incentives, including long-term contracts providing foreign companies with exclusive rights or joint-venture contracts that pre-empt tax or royalty payments in favor of establishing the Government's equity position. The authorities intend to continue their flexible market-based exchange rate ~olicv.

Given the current level of reserves and the size of possible shocks, the authorities agreed that the achievement of the reserve target would take precedence over exchange rate stabilization. L/ The National Bank will therefore not intervene in the market in order to change the trend in the exchange rate should strong downward pressures arise. In the event that capital inflows, including from de-dollarization, put upward pressure on the rate, the National Bank intends to bolster its reserve position by providing riel to the market rather than let the rate appreciate significantly. Cambodia's trade svstem is relatively liberal (as described more fully in the MEFP). Currently, export restrictions apply only to logs and sawn timber (for environmental reasons), gems (for security reasons), gold, silver, and antiquities. The authorities noted that export restrictions were necessary given the urgency of the environmental and security problems and their limited ability to implement other measures, but that they would review these restrictions during the year in an ongoing effort to find alternative solutions. There are no quantitative import restrictions. Cambodia relies relatively heavily on trade taxes for government revenue, in part because of the difficulties of collecting taxes internally. The import tariff structure consists of a four-band system with a peak statutory rate of 50 percent (applicable to selected consumer products such as alcohol, cigarettes and gasoline). Similarly, an ad valorem export tax has recently been imposed on rubber, which is produced entirely for export. 2/ w The Cambodian authorities are taking steps to inteprate the economy into the world trading system. To this end, the Ministry of Commerce has established a unit in its Foreign Trade Department to focus specifically on the application for joining the World Trade Organization. The authorities stated that they hoped to be granted MFN status by the United States in 1995. Given the early stages at which Cambodia is currently in regard to WTO membership, the authorities did not have a clear view as to the potential impact of the Uruzuav Round. Cambodia maintains a liberal exchanpe system, with no restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, and no discriminatory currency arrangements or multiple currency practices. In order to bring the legal regime into line with the liberal de facto system, a new foreign exchange law has been drafted and is expected to be 1/ External assets that may be released from currently blocked accounts will not be counted toward meeting the reserve targets. 2/ The tax is being introduced in part to offset the reductions in transfers to the budget that formerly flowed from the autonomous public' enterprises operating under the Ministry of Agriculture. 2/ As anticipated in the first-year ESAF-supported program, the Government has simplified the procedures for registering trading companies following the passage of Chapter One of the new Code of Commerce.

The authorities confirmed that they will accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, once this step is completed. The authorities are working toward normalization of relations with official creditors. In January 1995, Paris Club creditors proposed terms of reference for a debt restructuring-- the first case incorporating the highly concessional "Naples Terms"-- and Cambodia accepted the terms in February. All of the debts involved stem from contracts originally concluded more than two decades ago. The bilateral agreement implementing the Paris Club terms of reference has been concluded with Japan and discussions with other creditors are underway. Cambodia is also approaching official creditors not participating in the Paris Club for rescheduling on comparable terms. u In the discussions on the external debt strategy, the authorities agreed that nonconcessional external borrowing was not consistent with Cambodia's very limited debt-servicing capacity. The Government will therefore not contract or guarantee any external debt on commercial terms over the program period. Debt on concessional terms will only be contracted after economic viability and prospective returns have been assured. In order to ensure that all contracts and guarantees are passed through budgetary channels, the Minister of Economy and Finance has been given sole authority over such contracts, which will also require the approval of the two Prime Ministers. Potential external creditors have been advised by the Ministry of Economy and Finance of these new procedures, and their implementation has led to the cancellation of two contracts that had been under consideration. 5. Structural reforms While important initial steps have been taken in advancing the Government's agenda for structural reform, the authorities recognize the need to accelerate the pace of implementation. Studies have been completed or are nearing completion in a wide range of areas, and the authorities are now faced with the challenge of setting priorities, making decisions, and taking actions. In addition to the fiscal and financial sector reforms discussed above, the authorities will focus in particular on early actions in the key areas of public enterprise reform and privatization, and reform of the civil service, the military, and the legal system (as described in paragraphs 36-41 of the MEFP). The authorities stressed that successful u Most of these debts, amounting to some Rub 840 million, are owed to the Russian Federation and were originally extended in the context of the CMEA on an interest-free basis. Assuming treatment comparable to that given by the Paris Club under the provisions governing ODA debts, a restructuring would involve repayments on a graduated 40"year repayment schedule with 16 years' grace at the original interest rate. These assumptions imply that a restructuring of these debts would have no balance of payments impact over the time period considered in this report.

IV. Medium-Term Prosuects and Canacitv to Resay the Fund Cambodia has only recently emerged from isolation and its statistical data base is very weak. Projections are therefore subject to a larger-than- usual degree of uncertainty. The staff's long-term balance of payments scenario, described in Annex VII is based on the assumption of a stable political environment, continued implementation of a strategy aimed at macroeconomic stability, rehabilitation of the Cambodian economy, and reintegration into the regional and world economy. Output growth is assumed to remain at about 7 percent, with a slight slowing toward the end of the projection period. Exports of goods and services would grow rapidly, especially beginning in 1998 after a sharp decline in 1995 and 1996 related to the re-imposition of the ban on log exports. 2/ Growth would come from three sources: rubber, nontraditional exports spurred by foreign investment, and, starting in the medium term, exports of rice. With import growth reflecting both reconstruction needs and the economic growth assumption, the current account deficit would remain large over the next five years but then decline steadily. Direct foreign investment would become increasingly important. The bulk of external financing over the period would, however, come from highly concessional official flows, though the scenario incorporates a reduction in Cambodia's reliance on official development assistance. Despite the uncertainties over the medium term, the capacity to discharge obligations to the Fund should be reasonably well assured (Appendix Table 7). Obligations to the Fund are projected to average about 2 l/2 percent of exports of goods and services during the period 2000-2004, with a peak of 3 l/2 percent in 2002. 1/ Technical assistance from a number of multilateral and bilateral sources is supporting the design of such schemes. L?/ Timber exports are likely to resume in time at a lower rate than previously, although their timing and level is uncertain.

Performance under the first year of the Government's ESAF-supported program was broadly favorable despite difficult circumstances, including an unsettled security situation. Output growth was substantial, though lower and less balanced than envisaged, inflationary pressures were kept in check by continued fiscal restraint, and the external position improved. Good progress was also made in advancing the Government's agenda of structural reforms. Consolidation of the initial gains on the macroeconomic front will require perseverance in maintaining financial discipline. Fiscal reform, especially adoption of measures to improve transparency in government transactions and to strengthen budgetary monitoring and control, is key-- together with political resolve- -to containing fiscal pressures, notably those arising from high levels of defense and security spending. A start has already been made, and the authorities, recognizing the urgency of following through with their announced intentions, have reaffirmed their commitment to full implementation of their policies in this area. The decisions to adopt a sunplementarv budget for 1995 and to meet the higher expenditure requirements through additional tax measures and improved revenue collection demonstrate the authorities' commitment to move forward with fiscal reform. The new tax measures represent an important step toward broadening the domestic tax base and reducing reliance on trade taxes. The fiscal situation will remain tight, however, and achievement of the budgetary targets will require sustained efforts at revenue collection and a strict containment of current expenditures-- including maintenance of the freeze on civil service salaries--as well as sustained efforts to increase the efficiency of military spending. Given the high degree of uncertainty, close monitoring of fiscal developments will be required, and the authorities will need to stand ready to activate the agreed contingency measures. Further tax measures will be implemented in the context of the 1996 budget, which should also establish a clear framework for setting expenditure priorities. Monetary nolicv will continue to be supportive of the authorities' efforts at maintaining macroeconomic stability, but the high degree of dollarization limits the scope for effective monetary control. The development of market-based instruments to control liquidity growth, including through the early introduction of treasury bills, will over time strengthen the National Bank's control capability. In the meantime, bank- by-bank credit ceilings will need to be used. The large number of recently established commercial banks poses particular challenges for bankinz sunervision. The National Bank's quick response to emerging problems demonstrated its determination to deal with irregularities as needed. It is urgent that the National Bank completes its Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - comprehensive review of the activities of commercial banks and follows through with plans for a significant reinforcement of banking supervision. The exchange rate will continue to be market determined, underpinned by sound fiscal and monetary policies to ensure basic stability. The National Bank recognizes the need to strengthen its reserve position and will target exchange market intervention toward meeting the programmed level of reserves. More favorable external developments should be used as an opportunity to bolster reserves further. The staff's projections indicate a manageable balance of uavments outlook, on the assumption of political stability and the continued pursuit of sound policies. The projected widening of the current account deficit during the program period is largely associated with the transfer of aid resources. The authorities' medium-term outward-oriented development strategy, based on private-sector led economic growth, should, over time, reduce reliance on official financing. The authorities place particular importance on attracting private foreign direct investment, but will need to focus more closely on the types of investment needed for Cambodia's economic development and on the structure of incentives to ensure consistency with their medium-term fiscal objectives. The authorities recognize that external debt on nonconcessional terms remains inconsistent with Cambodia's limited debt service capacity. The nonconcessional external debt that was contracted in 1994 by the Ministry of Defense--in violation of the Government's commitments under the first annual ESAF arrangement- -was only recently revealed to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The Ministry of Economy and Finance, which has now been given the sole authority over all external debt contracts and guarantees, has initiated discussions with one creditor for more concessional terms, has cancelled contracts that were under consideration, and has declared that there will be no nonconcessional borrowing during the program period. The authorities have advised potential creditors of these new procedures. While the Government's structural reform program remains broadly on track, there is a need to accelerate the pace of implementation. With the conclusion of initial studies, the authorities are now facing an ambitious agenda for making decisions and taking actions. Particular emphasis should be placed on reform of the civil service and the military. The staff welcomes the authorities' willingness to state clear goals and timetables for downsizing. Achievement of these goals will require continued technical assistance, and determined efforts at implementation should be supported with targeted financial assistance from official donors. While considerable progress has been achieved in rebuilding Cambodia's economic data base, the authorities recognize the need for further substantial improvements in all principal sectors. They remain committed to continue their efforts to improve the coverage and quality of macroeconomic data, and to implement the recommendations of technical assistance missions.

While risks facing the program from the fragile political situation and the unsettled security environment remain, the staff considers Cambodia's capacity to repay the Fund as reasonably assured. It recommends therefore Executive Board approval of Cambodia's request for the second annual arrangement under the ESAF. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard la-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - VI.

With the support of the international community, the transformation of the Cambodian economy to a market-based system is progressing rapidly. The program, supported by the first annual Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) arrangement approved by the Fund Executive Board on May 6, 1994, has yielded significant results, as indicated in the attached memorandum. 2. The Royal Government of Cambodia has formulated its economic program for the period 1995-97, as outlined in the attached updated Policy Framework Paper (PFP), prepared in close collaboration with the staffs of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. The paper sets forth the Government's basic economic objectives for 1995-97 and the macroeconomic and structural adjustment policies designed to achieve them. The Government of Cambodia will remain in close contact with the staffs of the Fund and the World Bank in developing and implementing these policies, and the PFP will be updated annually. To facilitate a wider distribution of the PFP within the international community, the Government of Cambodia authorizes you, at your discretion, to make the PFP document publicly available. 3. We also attach a memorandum of economic and financial policies outlining the Government's detailed economic objectives and intended policies for the period July 1995-June 1996. In support of its economic program, the Government of Cambodia requests from the Fund the second annual arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 28 million under the three-year ESAF arrangement approved last year. Cambodia will continue to provide the Fund with such information as it requests in connection with progress in implementing its economic and financial policies and achievement of the objectives of the program. 4. The Government believes that the policies described in the attached memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program. During the period of the arrangement, the Government will consult with the Managing Director of the Fund on the adoption of any corrective measures that may be appropriate to meet the program objectives. Moreover, after the period of the ESAF arrangement while Cambodia has financial obligations to the Fund arising from the arrangement, the Government will consult with the Fund from time to time (at the initiative of either the Cambodian Government or the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - ANNEXI Managing Director of the Fund) on Cambodia's economic and financial policies.

The rehabilitation and reconstruction of Cambodia is under way following a long period of war, genocide, and internal turmoil. The restoration of a democratic government in 1993 created a political environment conducive to more concerted policymaking. Ties with the international community have been resumed, market-oriented reforms are being implemented, and progress has been made toward restoring macroeconomic stability. The Government nevertheless continues to face serious challenges. 2. In 1994, the Government of Cambodia launched a medium-term adjustment and reform program supported by financial assistance from the Fund under the ESAF and from other multilateral institutions and bilateral donors. Significant progress has been made during this first year in restoring macroeconomic stability, advancing the pace of rehabilitation, and laying the foundation for longer-term reconstruction and sustained economic growth. During the coming year, the Government's policies will aim at consolidating the macroeconomic progress made to date and accelerating the structural reforms needed to advance the transition to a market economy. The program for the second annual ESAF arrangement emphasizes macroeconomic stabilization, institutional strengthening supported by comprehensive technical assistance, substantial increases in public investment, and the initiation of wide-ranging structural reforms aimed at enhancing saving, investment and growth over the longer term. II. Performance Under the First-Year ESAF 3. Macroeconomic performance during the first year of the ESAF-supported program was generally favorable, as described in more detail in the Policy Framework Paper 1995-97. Output growth in 1994, estimated at 4 percent, was lower than expected, but substantial in light of a sharp decrease in rice output due to severe flooding followed by drought. The resulting surge in food prices, together with continued strong liquidity growth, contributed to an increase in the consumer price index by 18 percent during 1994 (final- quarter basis), significantly higher than programmed. However, fiscal policy helped keep inflationary pressures in check and the annual rate of inflation slowed to below 10 percent for the first half of 1995. The recorded external current account deficit widened with a significant rise in official development assistance and private capital flows, while the gross foreign reserves position improved, exceeding the target (as revised in November 1994) by more than $20 million. 4. The quantitative benchmarks under the first-year ESAF-supported program were met with the exception of the ceilings on external debt. Strong revenue performance combined with restraint on nondefense spending helped Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - ANNEX I limit the impact of higher-than-envisaged military expenditure and kept the current and overall government deficits to 1 l/2 percent and 7 percent of GDP, respectively, slightly above the program targets. There was no central bank financing of the budget and the net domestic assets of the banking system remained well within program targets. The floors on official foreign reserves were also observed. The ceilings on the contracting of external debt were exceeded, however, as the result of over $30 million in largely defense-related nonconcessional borrowing. 5. Progress was recorded in a number of structural areas during 1994, including fiscal management, legal reforms, foreign investment regulations, civil service, financial sector reforms, public enterprise reforms, and external sector reforms. Nevertheless, significant further efforts will need to be made in the period ahead, as emphasized below. III. Medium-Term Strategv and Obiectives 6. As Cambodia moves beyond the initial stage of stabilization, the Government faces the more difficult challenges of consolidating the gains on the macroeconomic front while moving ahead with a wide range of structural reforms. The key elements of its medium-term strategy are: continued fiscal restraint buttressed by transparent budget procedures; a cautious monetary policy; a substantial public investment program supported by aid financing and targeted to the most urgent needs of economic and social rehabilitation; and the pursuit of structural reforms in the financial sector, the civil service, military, and public enterprises. Continued macroeconomic stability and structural reform are expected to make Cambodia increasingly attractive to foreign investors, though for some time to come the reconstruction program will continue to rely heavily on concessional foreign aid. 7. The macroeconomic program for 1995-97 aims at: (i) increasing the rate of output growth to 7 percent in 1995 and 7 l/2 percent in both 1996 and 1997; (ii) reducing the rate of inflation to 5 percent (final quarter basis) by 1997, the rate now prevailing in partner countries; (iii) reducing the external current account deficit to 13 3/'4 percent of GDP in 1997 after increases in 1995 and 1996 associated with the resource transfer related to aid financing; and (iv) a significant strengthening of the official reserve position. IV. Policies for the Period to June 1996 8. The macroeconomic objectives for the program period are consistent with the original medium-term objectives supported under the ESAF and include: output growth of 7 percent in 1995; a reduction of inflation to below 8 percent (final quarter basis); and an increase in official reserves to 2 l/4 months of import cover by the end of the program year. The current fiscal deficit is targeted at 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995 and should decline in 1996 to 3/4 percent while government capital expenditure is slated to rise to over 6 percent of GDP, largely covered by foreign aid Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 41 - ANNEX1 flows. Virtual alyoidance of bank financing of the budget will continue to proxlide the anchor for financial stability. 9. The Government recognizes that attainment of its medium-term objectives requires a sustained commitment to continued reform in a number of areas. Fiscal restraint will have to be accompanied by significant structural reforms to revenue, expenditure, and fiscal institutions. The conduct of monetary policy will be challenging as de-dollarization proceeds. Achieving a sustainable balance of payments over the medium term while reducing reliance on official external assistance will require progress in developing the export potential of the Cambodian economy, including through attracting foreign direct investment. Fiscal policy 10. Fiscal consolidation remains at the center of the Government's medium- term adjustment and rehabilitation strategy. Successful implementation of the Government's fiscal agenda will require a restructuring of the government budget over the medium term to develop new revenue sources and to redirect expenditure priorities toward the country's considerable social and infrastructure needs. Success will also require a strengthening of budgetary procedures to ensure that all fiscal operations are accounted for in a transparent and timely manner. 11. In order to sustain macroeconomic stability and reduce heavy reliance on cash external assistance, the Government intends to eliminate the current budget deficit by 1997. To achieve this, the revenue-to-GDP ratio will need to be raised from its current low level and the tax base broadened through an acceleration of reform of the tax system. The level of spending on basic services will need to be raised in line with revenue mobilization, the ability to shift resources away from military expenditure and the provision of external finance. Regarding capital expenditure, the challenge is to make efficient use of aid financing to rebuild the ravaged infrastructure. 12. The initial 1995 budget had targeted current and overall fiscal deficits (cash basis) of 1 l/4 percent and 6 l/4 percent of GDP, respectively. Developments subsequent to its passage in late December 1994 revealed a significantly higher level of military expenditure during 1994 and early 1995 than previously estimated, in part financed by extrabudgetary revenues as well as nonconcessional external borrowing. To help bring these extrabudgetary operations into the budgetary process, the Government has decided to submit to the National Assembly in August 1995 both a revision to the fiscal outturn for 1994 and a revised financial law for 1995. In order to limit the current deficit to 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995 in the face of significantly higher-than-envisaged spending, the revised budget framework calls for a substantial increase in revenue, including additional tax measures. These additional tax measures are also necessary in 1995 to accelerate the pace of tax reform and shift away from the heavy reliance on revenues from customs and forestry operations. Capital spending is slated to increase by 3/4 percent of GDP to 6 l/4 percent of GDP reflecting the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - ANNEX I greater availability of project aid. The overall deficit of 7 l/2 percent of GDP will be virtually covered by foreign financing. 13. Targeting budpet revenue of 7 l/2 percent of GDP, the 1995 budget had adopted a number of measures, including an increase in the import duty on gasoline, elimination of several exemptions from import duty, and introduction of a progressive wage tax. While revenue performance during the first months of 1995 exceeded the budget projections due to improvements in tax collection and royalties from forestry products, further strengthening of revenue efforts is required. In order to achieve the revised revenue target of 10 percent of GDP, the Government is implementing the following additional measures in the context of the revised budget. First, the recently signed preshipment import inspection agreement with SGS, which will enter into effect in early September, should bolster custom duty collection (the major source of budget revenue). Second, the Government will ensure that all revenues from forestry operations will be passed to the budget. Although log exports were banned effective May 1, 1995, at 1eas.t CR 48 billion in additional revenue will accrue to the budget from the sale of already felled logs for domestic use. Third, to move forward with tax reform and to strengthen budgetary receipts further, the Government is taking a series of steps (Table 1). Effective July 1, 1995 the dutiable values of gasoline and diesel were increased. Additional revenue measures sufficient to increase the share of revenues by 0.5 percent of GDP on an annual basis will be implemented by September 1, 1995. These will include harmonization of the excise tax at the rate of 10 percent on selected goods (soft drinks, alcohol, cigarettes, and gasoline), which are produced locally and imported, and introduction of a tax on rubber exports at a rate of 10 percent. Finally, measures yielding another 0.5 percent of GDP will be incorporated into the 1996 Budget Law. 14. Expenditure policies must continue to respect the constraints imposed by the need for continued macroeconomic stabilization efforts in the context of ongoing defense and security requirements. At the same time, public spending policy needs to ensure the provision of basic services and support long-run economic development. Thus, while current spending will remain broadly unchanged at 11 l/4 percent of GDP in 1995, defense expenditure is targeted to decline by about 1 l/4 percent of GDP from its 1994 level to below 6 percent in 1995, allowing an increase in nondefense current expenditure. Capital expenditure will rise to 6 l/4 percent of GDP in line with the additional provision of external finance, reflecting Cambodia's large reconstruction and rehabilitation needs. The local financing of public investment will also increase, and represents a necessary spending priority for the budget. 15. In order to enhance transparency in budgetary policy, the Government will continue to formulate and implement revenue and expenditure policies within the framework of the Organic Budget Law. Thus, the Government remains committed to channeling all revenues and spending through the budget. In particular, the Government has put in place procedures to record the volume and value of all forestry operations and to transfer all fees and taxes arising from these operations--particularly from the sale of wood for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 43 - ANNEX I domestic use--to the budget in a timely manner. Competitive bidding procedures for government projects and procurement will be established by end-September 1995. The Government has also decided to pass to the budget all fees and commissions associated with government contracts and all revenues generated by government agencies through leasing of government assets and other commercial activities. Specific steps for the strict implementation of these procedures include issuance of subdecrees establishing strict financial control and audit mechanisms and the establishment of a Public Inspector's Office in the Ministry of Finance by end-October 1995. 16. Internal monitoring and control will also be improved through the establishment of audit and inspection procedures and treasury cash management functions; the relevant decrees have already been drafted and will be issued by end-August 1995. The Ministry of Economy and Finance will also assign financial controllers to each ministry by October 1995 to strengthen budgetary and payment procedures. Treasury operations will be improved and, in particular, a direct payments system by the Treasury to suppliers for expenditure beyond a specified level will be implemented by October 1995, with technical assistance from the World Bank starting with the five largest spending ministries. The budget preparation and management capacity of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, technical ministries and the provincial administrations will also be strengthened with technical assistance from the World Bank. 17. Close monitoring of fiscal developments will continue to be essential given the high degree of uncertainty in the budget outlook, arising in particular from the security situation and fragility of the revenue base, which remains highly dependent on import duties in part associated with re- exports. The Government stands ready to implement quickly a set of contingency revenue measures should fiscal pressures emerge. The measures would include further increases in petroleum duties as well as increases in motor vehicle and business fees. In addition, discretionary within-year cuts in spending will be considered, but such cuts will protect basic services and priority investment. 18. The Government intends to undertake an interim review in November 1995 in consultation with Fund staff, in order to detect any deviations from the desired path and to implement corrective measures as needed. This review-- which would be in addition to the midterm review in early 1996--will focus in particular on the fiscal program for 1996. The Government will ensure that the budget for 1996, to be approved by the National Assembly by December 1995, will be consistent with the program targets. Monetary policy and financial sector reform 19. With elimination of bank financing of the budget deficit, monetary policy is now in a better position to keep inflationary pressure in check while ensuring that adequate credit is available to the private sector. Progress has also been made in adopting and implementing financial sector reforms necessary for achieving a successful transition to a healthy two- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - ANNEX1 tier banking system. Monetary policy in Cambodia continues, however, to be complicated by "dollarization" of the economy and a high degree of currency substitution. Transactions are effected mostly in cash, riel deposits of the private sector are almost nonexistent, and money demand in riel has been highly volatile. 20. One factor inhibiting the process of "de-dollarization" has been the low denominations of domestic currency. In order to encourage the use of the domestic currency banknotes, the National Bank introduced larger denominated currency notes beginning in March 1995. The attractiveness of the riel and riel deposits should also grow in line with the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and positive real interest rates, as well as the normalization of the security situation. In ,order to facilitate de- dollarization, the Government will issue a circular requiring ministries and government agencies to denominate in riel payment for government services, fees, and taxes. Broader financial sector reforms (such as encouraging the use of riel-denominated checks and other modern means of payments to reduce reliance on cash and development of a money market for domestic currency) will be implemented with technical assistance from the UNDP and the Fund. 21. For the program year, monetary policy aims at lowering inflation to below 8 percent (quarterly average basis). Growth of liquidity is projected to decline to 15 percent over the program period, consistent with a further modest reduction in velocity and projected output and price movements. Ceilings have been placed on the net domestic assets of the banking system. In view of the limits that are also to be placed on credit to Government and to nonfinancial public enterprises, there should be adequate scope for a significant increase in credit to the private sector. The possibility of significant shifts between foreign currency in circulation and measured liquidity implies, however, that the monetary program will have to be monitored closely and possibly modified in light of developments in inflation and the exchange rate. 22. Indirect monetary control instruments and financial programming are being further developed, but mechanisms for direct credit control are needed in the transition period. To this end, the National Bank prepared in May 1995 a contingency plan for the implementation of individual bank credit ceilings, which could be put in place in the event that conditions warrant a reduction in liquidity growth. The National Bank will also stand ready to raise reserve requirements, which were introduced in 1994 at a level of 5 percent. However, the current high level and uneven distribution of banks' excess reserves makes changes in reserve requirements a largely ineffective instrument of monetary policy at this stage. While the commercial banks will continue to set their interest rates freely, the National Bank will seek to influence these rates indirectly--by regulating overall liquidity conditions--in order to ensure that they remain positive in real terms. 23. The National Bank will move ahead with the reform of its main operations, supported by provision of substantial technical assistance by the international community. The National Bank is improving its accounting Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - ANNEX I and financial programming procedures and will complete the shift to a new plan of accounts. It will also regularly prepare, on the basis of the new plan of accounts, its own balance sheet as well as income and expenditure statements, and will implement an annual budget, starting in 1996. This, together with strengthened internal audit mechanisms, should enhance the National Bank's internal monitoring procedures. The National Bank is already implementing a flash reporting system as an aid to policy making. It will also develop projections for its foreign exchange receipts and payments to facilitate decision making regarding exchange market intervention. 24. During 1995, the National Bank and the Ministry of Economy and Finance will draw up plans for the issuance of riel-denominated treasury bills to assist in the management of riel liquidity and the establishment of a market-determined riel interest rate. Issuance of these securities is expected to commence by November 1995. 25. As the next step in the transition to a healthy two-tier banking system, the new central bank law is expected to take effect from end- September 1995. This law will strengthen the autonomy of the National Bank and limit central bank credit to the Government. In addition, the Government is preparing a draft of a new commercial banking law for submission to the National Assembly by December 1995. This law will clarify the legal framework for the ownership, capital structure and management of banks, and for prudential measures and the supervision of banks. In order to eliminate a potential conflict of interest, the National Bank will develop proposals to divest its interests in the three remaining joint venture banks and its branches that engage in commercial banking activities. The two government-owned banks --the Foreign Trade Bank of Cambodia and the Municipality Bank--will be privatized by June 1996 in accordance with the procedures outlined in the privatization sub-decree (no. 38 ANK, April 19, 1995). In order to increase the availability of credit and other financial services in rural areas, the Government is developing plans for a rural credit system, which is expected to receive substantial donor support. The National Bank, which will have regulatory responsibility for the new system, will not lend to the new institutions at subsidized rates, provide them with capital, or treat them in a preferential manner, but will ensure that their operations--including particularly the volume of lending--are consistent with Cambodia's overall financial stability. 26. The Government recognizes the need to put in place a bank supervision system that effectively responds to the challenges posed by the recent proliferation of commercial banks in Cambodia. The National Bank has strengthened further its supervision through the adoption of additional prudential norms during the first half of 1995. During the program year, additional prudential regulations will be issued covering, inter alia, shareholders' obligations, transactions with related parties, futures market transactions and further improvements in reporting requirements. As part of the prudential reporting requirements of commercial banks, the National Bank will require that banks which submit questionable reports must obtain an opinion of an outside auditor regarding that report or any future reports. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 46 - ,ANNEXI The National Bank will also take steps to. reorganize the supervision department along the lines suggested by the Fund MAE mission, and will increase the number of permanent staff allocated to bank supervision. Consistent with the licensing procedures for commercial banks put in place in 1994, new licenses will be issued only to banks with an adequate capital base and a sound managerial track record. 27. The National Bank has begun a systematic review of commercial banks' activities with the aim of eliminating any irregularities that may exist in their operations. Any infractions discovered are being dealt with according to existing laws. One commercial bank has seen its license suspended and another has not requested renewal of its license. In exercising its supervisory function, the National Bank will adhere strictly to banking laws, regulations and internationally accepted norms and procedures, act swiftly in imposing necessary sanctions, and conduct its operations with a view to preserving its integrity and credibility. 28. As part of the centralization of official foreign reserve management at the National Bank completed in December 1994, a working group was established to review remaining public sector foreign exchange accounts at the commercial banks. The working group is expected to report by the end of September 1995, with a plan for transferring remaining public sector accounts to the National Bank and converting the remaining government foreign exchange accounts into domestic currency accounts. The National Bank is also taking steps to improve its reserve management capability. In particular, the National Bank will reduce its stock of foreign currency banknotes to a minimum required for its day-to-day operations; the rest of the funds will be placed in remunerated assets abroad. To facilitate these tasks, the reorganization of the Exchange Management Department of the National Bank will be initiated by August 1995 with the help of technical assistance from the Fund. External sector policies 29. Cambodia's development potential can best be realized within the framework of external policies that are aimed at fostering the country's reintegration into the regional and world economy, and the Government has developed a strategy to achieve these goals. The Government's external policies will be guided by the objective of maintaining a market-based exchange rate within the framework of liberalized exchange, foreign investment, and trade regimes. 30. The Cambodian economy continues, however, to be subject to a wide range of exogenous shocks. The National Bank will, therefore, not attempt to peg the exchange rate but will rely on the continued pursuit of appropriate financial policies to stabilize the rate. Moreover, in order to provide an adequate cushion for the economy and to further increase confidence in the riel, gross official foreign reserves will be increased to the equivalent of 2 l/4 months of imports of goods and services by end of the program year. This level will be viewed as a minimum, and if the process of de- dollarization proceeds faster than anticipated, the National Bank will use Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 47 - ANNEX I the opportunity to absorb additional foreign exchange from circulation. The National Bank's interventions in the foreign exchange market will take into account the de-dollarization process, the introduction of new riel banknotes, the stabilization of the riel, and the need to safeguard foreign reserves. The National Bank has already phased out its daily auctions of dollars in favor of interventions as and when needed to reduce daily fluctuations in the exchange rate. The National Bank will not intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to change the trend in the exchange rate, and the maintenance of at least the minimum level of foreign exchange reserves will take precedence over exchange rate stabilization. 31. Although the present foreign exchange law includes formal restrictions on the provision of foreign exchange for certain current transactions, in practice these restrictions are not enforced. In order to align the de facto and de jure exchange regimes, the Government will seek passage of a new foreign exchange law by the National Assembly by October 1995, which would eliminate these restrictive features. Following this step, the Government intends to accept the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement as a clear signal of Cambodia's reintegration into the international financial community. 32. The tariff structure currently comprises a four-band system with a maximum tariff of 50 percent and an average effective rate of 20 percent. Tariff rates will not be lowered during 1995. Although a lowering of the highest tariff rates is a medium-term objective of the Government, this will have to be carefully coordinated with a broadening of the nontrade revenue base to ensure adequate budgetary revenues. At present, export restrictions apply only to logs, sawn timber, gems, gold, silver, and antiquities. The Government announced the lifting of the ban on rice exports on March 9, 1995, to be effective December 1, 1995. During 1995, the export of rice is already allowed against offsetting imports of lower grade rice. From December 1995 onward, this transition arrangement will be eliminated. The ban on log exports, effective May 1, 1995, is being pursued for environmental reasons, as well as to encourage development of the higher value-added exports of semiprocessed wood and finished wood products. The ban on gem exports remains in effect for security reasons. These export restrictions will be reviewed in the course of 1995. The Government has simplified the procedures used to register trading companies in line with Chapter 1 of the new Code of Commerce. The Government will continue to enforce anti-smuggling laws vigorously. 33. Foreign direct investment flows will benefit from the recent streamlining of bureaucratic procedures under the new investment law, coupled with Cambodia's emerging financial stability. In order to ensure proper implementation of the investment law, the Government will adopt by August 1995 the necessary procedures as well as administrative regulations for the CDC with a view toward protecting the revenue base. A system for monthly reporting and monitoring of foreign investment flows will be put in place by end-December 1995 to allow a comprehensive follow-up on the implementation of investment approvals including external financial inflows, imports of goods and services and associated tax exemptions, profit Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 48 - ANNEX I remittances and interest payments, as well as payments of taxes, fees, and royalties to the budget in connection with these investments. To further encourage private investment, the Government plans to implement the provision of international conventions (such as MIGA and ICSID) and of bilateral agreements (such as with OPIC). 34. Cambodia's substantial rehabilitation and reconstruction needs can only be met through continued large-scale financial assistance from official sources on highly concessional terms. Nonconcessional borrowing is currently not consistent with Cambodia's very limited medium-term debt- servicing capacity. Consequently, and in light of the nonconcessional external debt contracted outside of budgetary channels during 1994, the Government will not contract or guarantee any external debt on commercial terms over the program period. Concessional external debt will continue to be contracted, but only after economic viability and prospective returns have been assured. A decree giving the Minister of Finance sole authority over the contracting or guaranteeing of all government external borrowing was signed on June 28, 1995, and the newly established procedures will be strictly implemented. The Government is also putting in place by end-1995 an external debt monitoring and management system under the authority of the Ministry of Economy and Finance with technical assistance from the World Bank. 35. The highly concessional rescheduling of Cambodia's debt to Paris Club creditors from the pre-1991 period is currently being implemented. In line with its commitment under the Paris Club rescheduling, the Government will seek to obtain agreements with all other bilateral creditors that did not participate in the Paris Club. The substantial debt relief already obtained, combined with the reinforced procedures ensuring a very cautious approach to debt management, should keep Cambodia's debt-service burden over the medium term at manageable levels. Enterprise reform and privatization 36. A privatization law was adopted by the National Assembly in December 1994, and the Government has adopted a comprehensive privatization strategy. A review of the activities of leased public enterprises is underway and is to be completed by September 1995, with the aim to effect asset sales to the private sector, The trading company KAMPEXIM and the petroleum company CKC will be offered for sale during 1995, and a broader list of firms to be privatized will be finalized by end-September 1995. Individual rehabilitation programs will be implemented during 1995 and 1996 for those enterprises remaining in the public sector, consistent with the following guidelines: (i) elimination of budgetary transfers; (ii) no credit from the National Bank; and (iii) quantitative limits over the availability of credit from commercial banks. Furthermore, the Government will seek to strengthen the efficiency of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by allowing flexible pricing policies, reducing excess manpower and increasing managerial autonomy. In light of the rubber sector's pre-war and historically large contribution to overall exports, the Government will prepare and initiate by September 1995 a plan for the sector's rehabilitation, including the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 49 - ANNEX I identification of entities to be privatized. In the meantime, the companies involved in the marketing of rubber--notably XAMPEXIM and DGPH--will provide the Ministry of Economy and Finance with monthly reports regarding the production and sale of rubber. 37. An inventory of cross debts of SOEs as of end-December 1994 was completed, and procedures for clearing these debts and preventing the accumulation of new ones are under consideration and are being applied in the context of the national and individual SOE budgets. To ensure the autonomy of SOEs a new legal framework (loi-cadre) will be prepared for submission to the National Assembly by March 1996. With the passage of this law, ministries will no longer undertake commercial activities, Other reforms a. Civil service reform 38. Progress was made during the first-year of the ESAF program in reforming the civil service. The automatic recruitment of high school graduates was ended beginning July 1, 1994. Recruitment into the civil service now also requires explicit approval from the Ministry of Economy and Finance and of the civil service commission. Other reforms included the introduction of a period of probation for school graduates entering the civil service without professional experience and the institutionalization of new rules and conditions for general recruitment into the civil service, including an examination for high school graduates. An initial count of civil servants was completed in February 1995, and a comprehensive census is expected to be completed by end-December 1995. During 1995, the Government will not increase the number of civil servants beyond 143,855, and civil service wages will not be raised. 39. The number of employees in the civil service will be reduced by 10 percent by end-1996 and an additional 10 percent by end-1997 in the context of a comprehensive administrative reform. This will require a safety net that helps cushion the transition of departing workers. The Government is working closely with UNDP, the World Bank, and other donors in developing a viable strategy to carry out the reform. The Government has asked the World Bank to participate in funding advisory services to help plan and design a strategy to reduce the number of staff in the civil service, the public enterprises, and the military. During 1995, the Government will develop a departure strategy that will include some or all of the following elements: early retirement, either optional or obligatory for certain categories of staff; voluntary departure for targeted classes and/or categories; and retrenchment. In addition to departure bonuses and/or enhanced retirement packages, studies will be initiated to plan the transition to a capitalized pension plan for civil servants and to a fully fledged national retirement and social security system. The work will include the costing and budgeting of various scenarios and the determination of options for paying the costs of the departure program. In order to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50 - I ANNEX improve the efficiency of the down-sized civil service, by end-1995 the Government will also finalize a plan for a revised civil service career and salary structure. b. Military reform 40. Progress has been made with respect to military reform. The number of active generals has been reduced from 1,876 to 147, and the number of colonels from 5,000 to 304, while the number of divisions has been reduced from 28 to 12, with further reduction to 6 divisions under active consideration. With the help of technical assistance, the Government will also adopt a plan for increasing the efficiency of the military. To that end, and in view of its intentions to effect a sizable reduction in the number of enlisted persons in the military from the current 132,000 to no more than 90,000 by end-1997, the Government will formulate a departure scheme for downsizing the military by end-March 1996. Progress in implementing such a scheme will hinge on the provision of external financial support for departing military personnel. c . Legal reform 41. The Government has initiated a reform of the legal system, including importantly, preparation of a new commercial code, comprising ten sets of laws, and intends to obtain passage of the complete code by end-December 1995. The Government is fully committed to establishing the rule of law, and to be open and publicly accountable, and recognizes that it must itself respect the principles of law and good governance as a foundation for the development of the private sector. To this end, the Government will submit to the National Assembly by October 1995 a draft law to provide the appropriate legal basis for a drive against corruption by officials, including laws and required subdecrees to establish a special independent Commission to implement this drive. d. Social safety net 42. Development of a social safety net for a broader cross section of the population is constrained by the limited amount of public resources. Nevertheless, in order to enable the Government to make more informed decisions with respect to expenditures affecting the more vulnerable groups of the population, it will be preparing a poverty assessment program using the recently completed socio-economic survey. e. Environmental policy 43. Environmental concerns continue to receive increased attention from the Cambodian Government. In 1994, a Royal Decree gave the Ministry of the Environment, established in 1993, authority to supervise and develop a National Protected Areas System covering 3.3 million hectares designated for national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, protected areas and multiple use management areas. An area of especially great concern to the Government is to avoid an environmentally unsustainable rate of cutting of trees. To this Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicANNEX I l end, the Government will begin to prepare a forest management code in 1995. The Government's ban on logging exports from May 1995 will operate as an interim solution. The Government has agreed to formulate, in consultation with the World Bank, ITTO, and other contributors, a program and a timetable for a National Environmental Action Plan. V. Performance Criteria, Benchmarks, MonitorinF and Review 44. The proposed performance criteria and structural benchmarks under the second annual ESAF arrangement are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Summary economic indicators are provided in Table 4. The quantitative performance criteria for end-December will include (i) a ceiling on the cumulative increase from end-December 1994 in the net domestic assets of the banking system; (ii) a ceiling on net bank credit to finance the budget; (iii) a zero ceiling on new external nonconcessional loans contracted or guaranteed by the public sector with 1 to 12-year maturity and a subceiling on loans of l-5 year maturity; (iv) a ceiling on outstanding short-term debt of the Government excluding normal import-related financing; (v) a floor on net official international reserves; and (vi) a ceiling on gross bank credit to public enterprises. These ceilings and floors have also been defined as quantitative benchmarks for end-September 1995, end-March 1996 and end-June 1996. The quantitative benchmarks for March 1996 and June 1996 are indicative and will be re-examined at the time of the midterm review of the second annual arrangement. Adjustors will be applied to selected benchmarks and performance criteria, as specified in Table 1. The Government will not accumulate new external arrears during the program period. 45. The implementation of policies will be subject to a mid-term review with the Fund, to be completed by end-March 1996. The completion of this review, together with observance of the end-September and end-December 1995 and continuous performance criteria, will be a condition for the availability of the second disbursemen t under the second annual ESAF arrangement. 46. Substantial progress has been made over the past two years in establishing a statistical base with the help of technical assistance from the Fund and other multilateral institutions. Efforts are ongoing to address the shortcomings in the quality and timeliness of statistics available for the monitoring of economic developments and understanding have been reached with Fund staff on a technical memorandum covering reporting requirements. In the months ahead, the Government will take steps to (i) improve the quality key variables, notably monetary data based on the new plan of accounts for the National Bank and data for exports and imports; (ii) monitor disbursements of foreign direct investment; and (iii) improve the collection of data for the compilation of National Accounts statistics.

While improving, it remains relatively weak. A considerable amount of technical assistance is being provided by the IMF, UNDP, AsDB, and the World Bank. Core data are generally provided on a timely basis (Table l), although there have been occasional delays recently. 1. National accounts The National Institute of Statistics (NIS) of the Ministry of Planning provides estimates on the comoonents of GDP by economic sector. Estimates of GDP by expenditure category are not available. The available statistical data base on which the national accounts are estimated is extremely weak and fragmentary, and data for many sectors are not collected on a systematic basis. Recent efforts to improve the national accounts have included a comprehensive social-economic survey and a survey of industrial establishments. Surveys of other major economic sectors have yet to be conducted, and the improvement of the economic data base will require several years. 2. Prices Estimates of inflation are based on three consumer nrice indices, compiled separately by the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), and the NIS. All three indices are designed to measure inflation in Phnom Penh only. Substantial discrepancies in estimated inflation arise between the three indices due mainly to differences in coverage and weighting systems. A recent Statistics Deport-ment technical assistance mission on consumer price indices concluded that the NIS index provides the most reliable measure of inflation in Cambodia. The Cambodian authorities agreed to cease compiling the NBC and MEF illdices by the end of 1995. No producer or wholesale price indices are avni lnble. 3. Government finance statistics Basic institutional arrangements for providing accurate and timely information on povernment transactions are not well developed. Annual government finance statistics are produced in final form several months after t-he end of the fiscal year. 1/ Data on expenditures are reported by hot-h economic and functional‘ classification, but the economic classification is very limited. Coverage does not include all extrabudgetary operations finnllced by foreign loans and p,rnnt.s. In this respect, the recording of fore i gn 1 oans and grant s in btrdgctary documents would provide useful inf:orm;31-ion for a~~nlysis and pol icy f~ormulatiori. The quarterly fiscal data reported (1\11-ing tllc yeat- arc t>aseci OII illcomplc~t e covcrnr,r , and sllbstantial Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 58 - ANNEX IL revisions are often required after the end of the fiscal year due to extrabudgetary operations. During the last few months, revenue and cash disbursement data for expenditure have begun to be provided to the Fund on a monthly basis. Cambodia does not report GFS data to the Fund's Statistics Department, and no GFS expert has been identified yet (under the UNDP- sponsored project), whose duties would encompass the establishment of a compilation system for GFS data, including data on extrabudgetary and foreign-financed operations. 4. Monetarv statistics Monetary statistics in Cambodia cover riel in circulation and domestic bank deposits in riel and foreign currencies; the data do not include the large amount of foreign currencies that circulates in the form of cash, as the latter cannot be measured. This constrains the analytical value of the monetary statistics. The National Bank of Cambodia produces the monetary survey, the balance sheet of the monetary authorities, and an aggregate balance sheet for deposit money banks on a monthly basis, with a lag of about one month. It also produces a weekly flash report on key items in the National Bank balance sheet and weekly data on gross official foreign reserves. The data are usually available on time. The quality of the data has improved considerably over the past year, although there continue to be problems of frequent and occasionally substantial revisions due to data misclassification. 5. External statistics Balance of oavments data are extremely weak. Following improvements in coverage in 1994, customs data on imports and exports of goods have improved and are available on a monthly basis with relatively short delays. Until recently, forestry exports have accounted for 60-80 percent of Cambodia's exports, with a significant proportion of these illegally exported. Estimates of the trade balance are therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. The Research Department of the National Bank of Cambodia provides estimates of many components of the service balance based on data from various sources, and Fund staff estimate external assistance and disbursements on the basis of discussions with multilateral and bilateral donors. The NBC has reported complete annual balance of payments data for 1992 and 1993 to STA; these were published in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook, 1994. The NBC is currently attempting to compile quarterly estimates for 1994 with the help of an expert provided by the Fund, who is being financed with UNDP funds for one year.

The international community has responded to this need by providing assistance in a wide range of areas, and the Government's ESAF program relies heavily on the comprehensive technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral agencies. Special emphasis has been placed on improving the operation of central institutions of macroeconomic management. Consequently, a medium-term technical assistance program has been put in place under a joint UNDP/AsDB/IMF/World Bank umbrella, designed to cover wide-ranging technical assistance needs in the macroeconomic area (Table 1). Against the background of weak institutional capacity as a result of Cambodia's legacy, technical assistance to support institutional strengthening has been and will remain critical. Within this overall framework, technical assistance has focused on further developing the policy capabilities of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the National Bank. In the MEF, experts are assisting in the development of tax policy and tax administration, as well as budget management and expenditure control. The Fund is providing long-term advisors both in the area of tax administration and general fiscal policy. Several FAD missions advised on fiscal reform in mid-1992 and late 1994, and prepared reports on tax policy and administration. A follow-up mission on tax administration was conducted by FAD in July 1995. Further FAD assistance is expected to support the development of a monthly budget reporting system and more accurate government finance statistics, all of which are enhancing the budget management capacity of the MEF. Regarding the statistical base, technical assistance has been provided by the Fund and other multilateral institutions, including the World Bank, UNDP, and the Asian Development Bank. With respect to the Fund, an STA multitopic mission analyzed major macroeconomic statistics in August- September 1992 and provided a foundation for subsequent work. STA has more recently provided assistance to enhance monetary and balance of payments statistics, as well as the consumer price index. In the National Bank, MAE has provided technical assistance to support the formulation and implementation of monetary policy, with focus on improvements in banking supervision, foreign exchange management, and cash management and accounting. MAE advisory missions have provided extensive advice on banking system development, central bank modernization, and financial sector legislation. A long-term advisor is assisting the National Bank in the development of balance of payments statistics. Multilateral and bilateral agencies are meeting technical assistance needs in other areas. The World Bank has been helping to strengthen the budget and treasury management capacity of the MEF, technical ministries, and provincial administrations.

First, the official exchange rate, which is expressed in riels per U.S. dollars, applies to all official external transactions conducted by the Government and the state enterprises. The official exchange rate is adjusted so as to maintain the spread between the official rate and the riel-U.S. dollar rate which prevails in the parallel market within certain limits as discussed below. Second, the parallel market rate, which is determined freely through interactions of foreign exchange traders in the private sector, applies to all other transactions. From the beginning of 1994, the spread between the official and parallel market exchange rates was limited to no more than 2 percent on a daily basis and from March 1994 to no more than 1 percent on a daily basis, thus unifying the dual exchange rate system.

Relations between Cambodia and the Bank were interrupted between 1975 and 1992. In September 1992, Cambodia decided to resume active participation in the Bank, appointing a representative on the Bank Board of Governors and designating the National Bank of Cambodia as the depository institution for Bank assets in Cambodia. Following an economic mission in March-April 1992 under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Cambodia, the Bank prepared an economic assessment entitled Cambodia--Agenda for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction that was released in June 1992 at the ministerial meeting in Tokyo. Bank staff also contributed to the AsDB-IMF-UNDP-World Bank report entitled "Cambodia--Socio-Economic Situation and Immediate Needs," which served as background material at that conference. Bank staff have also contributed to a similar document for the first International Committee for the Reconstruction of Cambodia held in September 1993. Starting in July-August 1992, the Bank fielded two public finance experts with bilateral financing. This technical assistance to UNTAC and the administration for strengthening expenditure programming and public finance control was expanded with two grant sources (Japan Grant Facility and Institutional Development Fund) for a total of $1.25 million. At the sectoral level, two UNDP projects executed by the Bank, one for water and another for power rehabilitation, amounting to $4.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively, were approved in November 1992 and are in implementation. An Emergency Rehabilitation Credit (amounting to $63 million equivalent) to provide critical imports in agriculture, transport, water supply, power, education, and health, was approved by the Bank Board on October 26, 1993. The bulk of the Credit has already been disbursed. A Technical Assistance (TA) Project ($17 million equivalent) was approved by the Bank Board on December 6, 1994. The TA Project will assist Cambodia in strengthening its institutional capacities for improving economic management and the environment for private sector development. The Bank's economic report on Cambodia (Cambodia--Rehabilitation Proeram: Implementation and Outlook, February 1995) was released for the March 1995 ICORC Meeting in Paris. The first Country Assistance Strategy was endorsed by the Board on June 8, 1995, as was the Social Fund Project ($20 million equivalent). The latter will finance small local projects in the area of social infrastructure, economic infrastructure, and social services. For FY 1996, an Economic Rehabilitation Credit ($40 million equivalent), expected to be presented to the Bank Board in September, will provide quick-disbursing balance of payments support, to be disbursed I/ Prepared by the Fund staff based on information provided by the World Bank.

In addition, a Power Rehabilitation Project ($40 million equivalent), that will focus on restoring the network in the Phnom Penh area, is being prepared. The Bank plans to open a resident mission in the second half of F'Y 1996. With regard to analytical work, a Country Economic Memorandum, to be presented to the first Consultative Group meeting in 1996, an Agricultural Sector Review, a Biodiversity Assessment, a National Environment Action Plan, and an Education Sector Action Plan are to be prepared. In FY 1997, two projects are expected to be launched. The Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (about $40 million equivalent) will provide funding for urgent rehabilitation needs in the areas of water transport, drainage, and roads. An Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project (about $20 million equivalent) will focus on institutional development at the Ministry of Agriculture, including rehabilitation training facilities, retraining of staff, and sponsoring pilot field activities.

In November 1991, an AsDB country consultation mission visited Cambodia at the request of the then Supreme National Council (SNC), at which time the Ministry of Planning was designated as the interim official channel of communication with the AsDB. Cambodia's arrears to the AsDB, which amounted to about $2 million, were cleared in November 1992. A number of AsDB missions, including those undertaken jointly with the Fund and the World Bank, visited Cambodia during 1992-93 to review economic performance as well as to determine the legal basis for multilateral lending to Cambodia during the transitional period. These missions also formulated an interim strategy for AsDB operations within the guidelines established under the emergency rehabilitation assistance program, elaborated in the Declaration of Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Cambodia issued at the Tokyo Ministerial Conference in June 1992. Based on its interim strategy, the AsDB approved in November 1992 the Snecial Rehabilitation Assistance Loan (SRAL) for an amount of $67.7 million. The SRAL, which is currently being disbursed, includes assistance for four priority sectors, namely, agriculture, transport, energy, and education. Under the SRAL, technical assistance, valued at $7.4 million and financed by the Japan Special Fund and the Swedish International Development Authority, is being provided to develop sectoral plans and assisting project implementation. In addition, the AsDB has provided technical assistance for Strenethenine Macroeconomic Management, which is cofinanced by the United Nations Development Program and is being implemented in collaboration with the Fund. In January 1994, an AsDB Country Programming mission visited Cambodia to develop a medium-term (1994-97) lending and technical assistance program. In light of its findings, the AsDB's interim strategy was revised to include reconstruction and development in the medium term. The AsDB's revised interim strategy is designed to alleviate certain key constraints through: (i) capacity building for strengthening the macroeconomic and sector agencies; (ii) financial assistance for the rehabilitation and upgrading of physical infrastructure; (iii) technical and financial support for social sectors, including the enhancement of the role of women in development; (iv) assistance for environment and natural resource management and conservation; and (v) support for measures designed to boost domestic resource mobilization. In October 1994, the AsDB held consultations with the various central and line ministries of the Government with the view to update its future country operational program (1995-98), and it also initiated work on a formal Country Operational Strategy Study (COSS) on Cambodia. The COSS was discussed with the Government in May 1995 and is expected to be presented to the AsDB's Board of Directors in August 1995. 1;/ Prepared by the Fund staff based on information provided by the Asian Development Bank.

Also, a large ($1.2 million) technical assistance project--Statistical System Development--was approved in December 1994. This technical assistance is building on the work already underway under the statistics component of the ongoing Macroeconomic Management technical assistance. The total amount of technical assistance (both project preparation and advisory) approved by the AsDB during 1992-94 stood at about $20 million, covering a number of priority sectors including agriculture, energy, transportation, water supply, education, health, and other social sectors. For 1995, the AsDB Board is expected to approve loans amounting to $45 million, while technical assistance is expected to amount to $8 million. The loan pipeline for 1995 includes two projects, the Basic Skills Project and the Rural Infrastructure Improvement Proiect. A program loan for the agricultural sector is expected to be processed in 1995 for consideration by the Board in early 1996. During the period 1996-97, AsDB loans are expected to average $75 million while technical assistance would amount to about $10 million on an annual basis.

The scenario extends the medium-term balance of payments outlook underlying the Policy Framework Paper, 1995-1997, and presented in Table 2 and Appendix Table 6. 1. ASSumDtiOnS and results The main assumntions underlying the scenario are: (i) maintenance of a relatively stable political and security situation; (ii) sustained implementation of financial policies aimed at a sound macroeconomic environment with inflation falling to 5 percent in 1998 and remaining unchanged thereafter; and (iii) continued implementation of structural and sectoral reforms. The scenario is based on the Government's outward-looking development strategy, combining public and private investment aimed both at a rehabilitation of the agricultural sector- -especially rice and rubber--and the creation of a modern manufacturing sector to promote exports of light manufactures while avoiding environmentally unsustainable exploitation of forestry resources. The scenario incorporates a reduction in Cambodia's reliance on concessional flows from official sources: grants and concessional loans combined are assumed to decline in real terms over the long term. Nevertheless, a substantial amount of aid is expected. Cumulative flows of official transfers and loans reach close to $3.5 billion over the period 1994-2006. (The current pipeline includes commitments of some $2 billion.) Foreign direct investment would provide an increasingly important source of financing, complementing official aid,by developing the private sector and export capacity. On exports, the ban on unfinished wood products is assumed to be maintained throughout the simulation period, though semi-finished wood products contribute to the growth of nontraditional exports. Rubber exports grow from 32,000 tons in 1995 to over 61,000 tons in 2006 as rehabilitation of the sector takes hold. Assuming that the excess of rice output (assumed to grow at 7 percent annually) over self-sufficiency requirements (population growth of 2.5 percent per year) is exported, and beginning with a self-sufficiency level of output of 1 l/2 million tons per year, rice exports increase throughout the period to reach over 1 million tons by the end of the simulation period. Even then, rice output would reach only three quarters of the level achieved in the late 1960s. Nontraditional exports begin to grow substantially as the benefits of FDI take hold. Tourism receipts are also assumed to grow significantly as the security situation improves and infrastructure investments in the early years enable this sector to expand. Import growth remains relatively high reflecting annual real GDP growth of 7.5 percent initially (but falling gradually to 6 percent by 2000) and the assumptions regarding FDI and official aid flows. Although interest pavments remain relatively low because of the assumed high degree of concessionality of external official financing, profit remittances mount Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 72 - substantially over the medium term given the large inflows of FDI, but would be expected to be largely reinvested. Over the period, the current accounq deficit declines from 14 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995 to 3 l/2 percent in 2006 (Table 1). While the debt service ratio rises during the initial years, the effects of the export-oriented development strategy are rapidly reflected in a falling debt service ratio, which declines from a peak of 15 3/4 percent in 1995 to 5 l/2 percent in 2006. This suggests that a slightly larger current account deficit could be accommodated through cautious external debt financing on somewhat less pronounced concessional terms in the later part of the projection period. Cambodia would nevertheless still not be in a position to take on commercial credits. 2. Sensitivitv of the projection Given Cambodia's recent emergence from isolation, the uncertainties attached to this scenario are even larger than those inherent in most long- term projections. This makes quantitative elaboration of alternative scenarios a less meaningful exercise than in other cases, although it is clear that the long-term outlook is particularly sensitive to certain key considerations. The outlook hinges critically on early and effective use of external assistance aimed at infrastructural investment and laying the base for solid growth performance over the long term. The outlook also hinges on securing continued inflows of external financing on highly concessional terms. Lower levels of inflows reflecting, for instance, a loss of confidence due to weak and/or delayed policy implementation on either macroeconomic or structural fronts, or deterioration in the security environment, could lead to low economic growth, constrained export capacity, and, consequently, to compressed imports. Attempts to increase imports through debt-financing (if available at all) would lead rapidly to an unsustainable debt service burden.
