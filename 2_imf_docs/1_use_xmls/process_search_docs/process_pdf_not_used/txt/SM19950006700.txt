Artus and Mark Allen April 4, 1995 I. Introduction The 1995 consultation discussions with the Netherlands were held in The Hague and Amsterdam during January 30 - February 6. The staff team l/ met with the Minister of Finance, the President of the Netherlands Bank (DNB), and officials from various government departments, the DNB, and the Central Planning Bureau, as well as representatives of the Confederation of Dutch Enterprises and the Christian National Trade Union, Mr. de Beaufort Wijnholds, Executive Director for the Netherlands, attended part of the meetings. The last consultation with the Netherlands was concluded on May 4, 1994 (EBM/94/40). On that occasion, Executive Directors noted that output had performed well relative to neighboring countries and that the guilder had been unaffected by the turmoil in the ERM in 1992-93. Directors supported continuation of the tight link of the guilder with the deutsche mark, and advocated frontloaded fiscal consolidation to reduce the high debt to GDP ratio. Directors also observed that the deep-seated structural problems, especially in the labor market, needed to be addressed as a matter of priority. Following national elections in May 1994, a three party left-right coalition headed by Prime Minister Kok (Labor Partyj assumed office in August 1994. The coalition agreement covers the period 1995-98 and provides for public expenditure reduction, lowering of the "collective burden" of taxes and social security premiums, reform of the labor market to reduce non-employment, and promoting domestic competition. 1/ Consisting of Messrs.

Economic setting With exports (as well as imports) being equivalent to about 50 percent of GDP, the Netherlands has one of the most open economies in the world. Thus, developments in output closely reflect those in its trading partners, mainly Germany and the other neighboring members of the European Union (EU). In tandem with these countries, the Netherlands experienced a period of sustained strong growth of real GDP in the period 1983-90, followed by a recession in the early 199Os, and a cyclical upswing since late 1993 (Chart 1, upper panel). Inflation in the Netherlands has been among the lowest in the EU, having generally been below that in Germany in recent years (Chart 1, lower panel). The long-standing emphasis on the control of inflation has enabled the Netherlands to maintain a close link between the guilder and the deutsche mark. Following a small devaluation in 1983, the guilder/mark exchange rate has generally remained within a corridor of f0.5 percent since then (Chart 2, upper panel). Maintaining exchange rate stability vis-a-vis the mark has been a central element of financial policy. As in many other European countries, budget deficits and public debt grew substantially in the 1970s and the early 1980s (Chart 3, upper panel). However, in the past ten years the Netherlands has pursued fiscal consolidation, and, unlike most other countries with fiscal problems, persisted with these efforts during the economic downswing in the early 1990s. As a result, the general government deficit fell substantially-- declining to a level well below the EU average--and public debt stabilized. At about 80 percent of GDP, public debt is near the EU median, while taxes and social security premiums are relatively high compared with other EU countries (Chart 3, lower panels). The large collective burden is mainly the result of a comprehensive social security system, which is among the most generous in Europe. Currently, some 25 percent of the working age population benefit from social support (excluding pensions), a large part of which is accounted for by high disa'bility benefits (Chart 4). 1/ The growth of revenues from natural gas in the 1960s and 1970s helped finance the build-up of this system. In recent years, however, the Netherlands has made efforts to reform and prune the social security system in order to reduce the collective burden and strengthen incentives to work. The Netherlands h.as not escaped the severe labor market problems experienced by most European countries since the mid-1970s, and growing attention has been paid to reform of the labor market, together with that of the social security system. High labor costs, strong disincentives to work, and other labor market rigidities have resulted in high unemployment and a JJ Although figures are not strictly comparable across countries, social expenditure on disability amounted to 7.4 percent of GDP in the Netherlands, as against 3.1 percent in Germany, 2.2 percent in France, and 2.9 percent in the EU as a whole in 1992.

However, against the background of rapid growth in the labor force, and helped by wage restraint, the Netherlands has been more successful in creating new jobs in the past ten years than other EU countries. lJ (Annual employment growth in the Netherlands was about 2 percent, compared with 0.5 percent in the EU, during 1983-93). Many of the new jobs, however, were part-time. Thus, the participation rate adjusted for hours worked remained low (Chart 5, lower panel). After having reached a peak of close to 12 percent in the early 198Os, the unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent in 1992 before rising to over 9 percent in 1994, with much of the joblessness being concentrated at the lower end of the labor market (Chart 5, upper panel). If the large number of beneficiaries in the disability and other social benefit schemes, which have frequently been used as alternatives to unemployment, are included, "broad unemployment" is substantially higher. 2J 2. Recent economic developments The Netherlands experienced a mild recession in 1993, with growth of real output slowing to l/2 percent, as private consumption weakened substantially and private investment fell for the first time since the early 1980s. The onset of recovery in continental Europe in the latter part of 1993 led to a sharp increase in exports, followed by a more broadly based strengthening of economic activity in the course of 1994. In the event, real GDP grew by close to 2 l/2 percent in 1994 (annual average)-- 3 l/4 percent on a fourth quarter basis. While exports grew strongly and residential investment surged due to rising house prices and lower long-term interest rates than in the early 199Os, private consumption registered only a mild recovery. With capacity utilization rising rapidly, business investment began to pick up in the latter part of the year. Consumer price inflation increased slightly to 2.8 percent in 1994 owing to higher import prices. Contractual wages in the manufacturing sector rose by 1 3/4 percent in 1994, somewhat less than in 1993 and well below the pace observed in the early 1990s (annual average of 5 l/4 percent in 1991- 92). Total employment stagnated in both 1993 and 1994, and the unemployment rate reached 9.2 percent in 1994 (average), declining somewhat in the course of the year. The main objective of fiscal policy in recent years was to reduce the budget deficit of the central government on a cash basis to just under 3 percent of GDP by 1994. A secondary objective was to prevent an increase in the collective burden above 46 l/2 percent of GDP. In the event, the L/ See the chapter on wage restraint and employment growth in the forthcoming paper on selected background issues. 2J According to an OECD estimate, the broad unemployment rate was 26 percent in 1993 (see: OECD - Economic Surveys - Netherlands (1993)).

The structural deficit showed an even steeper decline, having fallen to 2 l/4 percent of GDP by 1993. In view of the economic downturn, the 1994 budget prepared in mid-1993 did not aim at further fiscal consolidation and, in addition, in early 1994 the government announced reductions in taxes and social security premiums equivalent to nearly 1 percentage point of GDP (on an annual basis). As a result, both the actual and structural deficits widened somewhat in 1994. Monetary policy continued to be guided by the close link of the guilder to the deutsche mark, with the Netherlands, alone among the EU members, having entered into an agreement with Germany to maintain the guilder/DM rate within a band of f2.25 percent of its central rate following the widening of ERM margins in August 1993. While short-term interest rates were up to 1 percentage point below rates in Germany in 1993 and early 1994, the differential disappeared in the course of 1994. Since late 1994, short- term interest rates have been slightly above those in Germany. Long-term interest rates have moved closely in line with German rates in the past two years. The exchange rate, in terms o:E the deutsche mark, as well as interest rate differentials vis-8-vis Germany, remained stable during the period of exchange rate turbulence in February-March 1995. The guilder appreciated by about 10 percent in real effective terms (relative normalized unit labor costs) in 1991-94, reaching a level similar to that in the mid-1990s. This appreciation was caused by a rise in labor costs in the early 1990s followed by ,a marked nominal appreciation of the guilder vis-&-vis the dollar and a number of European currencies in 1992-94 (Chart 2, lower panel). In response to these developments, Dutch exporters cut profit margins, and export market shares, in fact, increased somewhat in the early 1990s. The current account has remained in substantial surplus (about 3 percent of GDP) in recent years, having shown little variation over the business cycle. The current account surpluses have been accompanied by net long-term capital ou.tflows, both for purchases of foreign securities and direct investment. In 1992 and 1993, large capital inflows triggered by the EMS crises resulted in an increase in official reserves equivalent to 4 percent of GDP; in 1994 foreign investors partly reversed their purchases of Dutch securities. Since end-1994, the guilder has appreciated by a further 5 percent in nominal effective terms. 3. Economic outlook With external demand forecast to remain buoyant and domestic demand accelerating, strong output growth is expected to continue in 1995-96 lJ The general government is comprised of the central government, the social security system, and local authorities. Social security funds have, on average, been in slight surplus, while the accounts of local government have virtually been in balance. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - (Table 1). Corporate investment is set to expand sharply in 1995 and is expected to remain strong in 1996, reflecting the current high rate of capacity utilization and the cyclical recovery of profits, the effects of which would more than outweigh that of higher long-term interest rates. Faster employment growth is expected to stimulate private consumption despite a rebound of the household saving rate from its low level during the recent cyclical downswing. In all, real GDP should grow by about 3 percent in 1995 and by about 2 3/4 percent in 1996, with the current output gap being closed. Inflation is expected to be little changed at 2 l/2 percent, as continued wage restraint should offset the impact of higher commodity and other import prices. The unemployment rate is projected to fall to 8 114 percent by 1996. The current account surplus is expected to remain at about 3 percent of GDP. These projections depend, of course, importantly on the strength of the recovery in Europe, developments in international financial markets, and the assumption of continued wage restraint. The staff's projections for 1995-96 are very close to those of the Central Planning Bureau. The medium-term projections summarized in Table 2 are part of the Spring 1995 World Economic Outlook exercise, which assumes unchanged real exchange rates from their January 1995 level, output in partner countries remaining at, or converging to, potential, and continued low inflation. For the Netherlands this scenario implies average annual GDP growth of 2 l/4 percent during 1997-2000 (equal to estimated potential growth), inflation of about 2 percent, and a current account surplus of about 3 percent of GDP. Despite faster job creation owing to structural reform, the unemployment rate is likely to remain around 8 percent, as reform of the social security system would also increase labor supply. III. Policv Discussions The policy discussions focussed on three issues: (i) pursuing further fiscal consolidation and ensuring that the relatively high debt to GDP ratio is set on a firm downward trend in the current cyclical upturn; (ii) maintaining price and exchange rate stability in a period of robust growth at home and financial market tensions internationally; and (iii) reforming the labor market and the system of social support to reduce unemployment and raise the participation rate. 1. Fiscal policy On assuming office in August 1994, the government announced a fiscal strategy that abandons the targeting of the central government deficit on a cash basis and adopts a real expenditure norm which also encompasses the social security system. The main reason prompting the government to change its strategy was that targeting the deficit necessitated numerous ad hoc adjustments in spending during the year. The new medium-term strategy calls for a decline in real expenditure by 0.7 percent per year, on average, in 1995-98 with fixed annual spending norms (Table 3). The cuts are to be made Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - in social security expenditure, while central government expenditure would rise slightly in real terms. Within overall central government spending, public investment and certain social expenditures (e.g., for job creation) are set to increase by more than the average. Table 3.

JJ Excluding on-budget social security expenditure, such as welfare. 2J The drop reflects, in part, shiEts to private financing. The expenditure reductions were (calibrated so that, on the basis of a conservative assumption of GDP growth of 2 percent per year during 1995-98, annual deficit ceilings are observed, which imply a gradual decline of the central government deficit from 4.5 p'ercent of GDP in 1994, excluding incidental factors, to 2.9 percent of GDP in 1998. Furthermore, the collective burden is to be lowered by about 2 percentage points of GDP in 1995-98 through reductions in taxes and social security premiums at the lower end of the wage scale (more than half of this decline has already been implemented in 1995). In the event of faster-than-projected revenue growth, the medium-term program left the allocation between further reduction in the deficit (beyond a small additional lo,wering of the central government deficit to 2.7 percent of GDP) or a reduction in the collective burden for a decision at a later stage. This issue is at the center of the current debate on fiscal policy. In 1995, the deficit of the general government is projected to fall slightly to 3 l/4 percent of GDP. However, the structural deficit of the general government would widen by about l/2 percentage point of GDP to 2 3/4 percent of GDP because of the reduction in the collective burden. (The 1995 budget is based on output growth of 3 percent).

Other important elements of the program are the privatization of the insurance of sick leave benefits and a reform of the disability benefits scheme, both of which are expected to result in cost savings through improved incentives. While earlier measures to tighten the administration of the disability scheme are now showing good results, costs are to be cut further through premium differentiation and, possibly, an opting out by companies to seek private insurance for new cases. I/ A number of difficult issues, however, are still to be resolved, and the reform may not be ready for implementation by January 1, 1996 as originally envisaged. Savings are also to be achieved in the area of health expenditures. Here, a report on curtailing costs and preventing cost overruns is nearing completion, but actual measures still need to be formulated. Other elements of the expenditure reduction program, such as a cutback of certain social security pensions, are still under discussion but should be ready to be introduced in 1996. The authorities acknowledged that the 1996 budget, which is to be formulated by September 1995, will provide a crucial test of the realism of the expenditure reduction plan. The staff team welcomed the switch to an expenditure-based medium-term fiscal strategy, because it appropriately focuses fiscal consolidation on the high level of public expenditure. Moreover, it reduces the likelihood of a procyclical fiscal policy implied by deficit targets. The staff team strongly encouraged the authorities to resist pressure to dilute the expenditure reduction program and to stick firmly to its plan. The determined implementation of the measures to curb the generous application of some of the social benefits programs, which were introduced in the past few years and were now beginning to bear fruit, was also important. A central issue of discussion was the use to be made of the likely faster revenue growth compared with the projections in the government's medium-term fiscal plan. This question is of particular relevance for 1996, as the assumption on GDP growth underlying the fiscal program is 1.2 percent, while the present staff projection (shared by the authorities) calls for growth of 2 3/4 percent. The staff team expressed the view that the authorities should let automatic stabilizers work, and use cyclical revenue gains to reduce the deficit rather than lower the collecti.ve burden. As a minimum, the higher revenue from taxes, as opposed to social security premiums, should be utilized for deficit and debt reduction. The staff also advocated that the cyclical increase in social security premiums be employed to reduce the budgetary transfers to the social security system, which are u See the chapter on social security reform in the forthcoming paper on selected background issues.

The staff team based its view on a number of considerations. First, letting automatic stabilizers work would be appropriate from a cyclical perspective, as it would help contain inflationary pressures during the recovery phase of the cycle. Applying automatic stabilizers asymmetrically by suspending them in periods of cyclical strength would also run the risk of undermining the hard-won fiscal credibility. Second, the general government deficit would fall only insignificantly below the Maastricht cr%terion of 3 percent of GDP in the latter part of the 199Os, if the additional tax revenues are used for tax cuts, thus providing insufficient room for manoeuvre in the event of a recession (Chart 6). A third argument concerns public debt. At 80 percent of GDP, public debt is high and it would not decline significantly during the current cyclical upswing, unless at least the additional tax revenue was allocated to deficit reduction. The Maastricht convergence criteria for stage III of EMU, however, postulate that debt ratios above 60 percent of GDP be sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace. Failure to reduce debt would thus not only have adverse long-term economic consequences but might also affect market confidence. Furthermore, fiscal consolidation and debt reduction are important underpinnings of the exchange rate link with the deutsche mark. A fiscal performance that does not match the recent success of Germany in reducing its deficit could eventually weaken confidence. Finally, longer-term developments related to demographic factors are also relevant (longer-term scenarios were discussed in detail in last year's staff report). 2J The pay-as-you-go social security system will require substantial increases in contribution rates to finance the rise in expenditure for public pensions and health care as the share of the elderly rises in the next decade. A high public debt might render it impossible to counteract through tax reductions the sharp rise in such contribution rates. This underscores the point that there is no long-run trade-off between debt and tax burden reduction. Given the prospective large increase in social security expenditure, the staff team also noted that debt reduction should I/ Such transfers are to rise from less than 1 percent of GDP in 1994 to more than 2 percent of G:DP in 1996. The increase in social security revenues relative to the conservative growth scenario would be about 3/4 percent of GDP by 1998. 2J See: Kingdom of the Netherlands - Netherlands - Staff Report for the 1994 Article IV Consultation (SM/94/89, 4,/6/94).

At the same time, concern was expressed about the high collective burden, and additional reductions in taxes and social security premiums were seen by some as a means to make faster progress in reducing unemployment. While the discussion was still ongoing within the government and its outcome remained unclear, it was indicated that a broad distinction was likely to be drawn between higher tax revenue and the cyclical increase in social security contributions. The authorities stressed that they would be reluctant to allow the extra tax revenues to be translated into a further reduction of the collective burden. However, the pay-as-you-go nature of the social security system implied that higher social security revenues would automatically lead to lower contribution rates. No significant change was foreseen in this system. In the view of the authorities, the increase in budgetary transfers to the social security system was not an issue of great concern, because what mattered was the level of general government expenditure. Thus, the focus of fiscal policy was on reducing overall spending. 2. Monetary ~olicv During most of 1992 and 1993, when short-term interest rates were significantly below those in Germany, while the guilder rose above its central rate, the special loan rate of the Netherlands Bank was reduced somewhat faster than the Bundesbank's repo rate (Chart 7). The negative market rate differential disappeared in mid-1994, when markets judged that the easing of monetary policy in Germany had run its course. Since then, the intervention rates in the Netherlands and in Germany have also been virtually identical. Beginning from late 1992, the guilder has been up to 0.7 percentage points above its central rate against the deutsche mark. With respect to interest rate developments, the authorities noted that the negative short-term differential vis-a-vis Germany in 1993 had been due to the unusual situation in that country, and that the re-emergence of a small positive differential since mid 1994 signalled a return to more normal conditions. Slightly higher long-term interest rates in the Netherlands were a reflection of structural factors, such as the lower liquidity of the Dutch capital market. The authorities emphasized that maintaining the tight link with the deutsche mark remained the intermediate target of monetary policy. The L/ In the Netherlands, every person is entitled to a public pension. In addition, most employed persons have a private pension arrangement, based on fully funded schemes. Public and private pension payments were roughly equal in size in recent years.

A significant discrepancy in the timing of monetary policy action vis-a-vis Germany was unlikely in the period ahead. In line with action taken by the Bundesbank, the Netherlands Bank reduced the rate on special loans by 0.3 percentage point to 4.5 percent and the rate on secured advances by 0.5 percentage point to 4.0 percent with effect from March 3:L, 1995. The authorities noted that they would be ready to participate in stage III of EMU whether it occurred in 1997 or at a later stage. 3. Labor market oolicies and structural reform The high unemployment, or non-employment, has been attributable to three main factors: high labor costs, especially at the low end of the market, reducing the demand for labor; a tax and welfare system blunting the incentives to work; and institutional rigidities and skills mismatches. With respect to labor costs, lower paid workers have increasingly been priced out of the market despite overall wage restraint and a freeze of the statutory minimum wage. An important cost factor has been the high tax and social security wedge of 27 percent near the minimum wage level. u In addition, collective bargaining agreements have generally provided for minimum wages well above the statutory minimum (together with substantial additional disability and sick leave benefits), and these agreements have been made binding across sectors. As a result, a relatively large and growing "forbidden zone" for wages has emerged at the lower end of the pay scale. 2J On the supply side, a welfare system providing for generous welfare, unemployment, and disabi'lity benefits, has resulted in a relatively high reservation wage and has reduced the incentives to find jobs, or accept lower paid employment. This lack of incentives is reinforced by the large tax and social security wedge between gross wages and take-home pay, and high effective marginal tax rates at income levels just above the statutory minimum wage. With regard to institutional rigidities, extensive employment security legislation has also given rise to high dismissal costs. In addition to promoting continued wage moderation, the new government aims to raise the participation rate, increase job creation, and reduce long-term unemployment through a number of measures. First, the tax and social security wedge for minimum wage earners average will be lowered from 27 in 1994 to about 23 percent in 1998, in line with the medium-term fiscal program discussed above. Second, the reform of the disability and sick lJ The tax and social security wedge is 42 percent for an average wage earner, which is above the level in most European countries. Furthermore, the marginal wedge is about 60 percent beginning from the minimum wage level. 2J See the forthcoming, paper on selected background issues.

Third, greater selectivity is urider consideration with respect to declaring collective bargaining agreements legally binding, withholding the legal binding of those agreements that provide for actual minimum wages above the statutory minimum. Fourth, the government's coalition agreement envisages the possibility of the temporary dispensation from the statutory minimum wage, which is high by international standards. L/ And finally, the government intends to expand existing employment programs by adding a total of 60,000 new jobs for young people and for the long-term unemployed. The costs of these measures would be largely offset by savings on unemployment benefits. The staff team welcomed the thrust of the proposed program. In commenting on the individual initiatives, it noted, however, that the envisaged greater selectivity in declaring collective bargaining agreements did not go as far as earlier more drastic plans. There was, thus, a concern that the objective of greater wage differentiation at the lower end of the pay scale might not be attained, and that the barriers to the entry of new firms that arise from the legal binding of collective bargaining agreements across whole sectors would remain. The authorities were also encouraged to provide generous dispensation from the minimum wage provisions. Furthermore, the staff expressed concern about the increase in government- financed employment programs, as they run the risk of adding permanently to government expenditure without resolving the underlying unemployment problem. The additional jobs imply a nearly 50 percent increase in the number of people in employment programs. While it is difficult to assess the impact of the proposed reform package on labor costs and the reservation wage since many of the measures cannot now be quantified, there are questions whether the package will stimulate employment to the extent expected. The reduction of the tax and social security wedge is not large in itself, and other measures to lower labor costs, such as the dispensation from the minimum wage, have yet to be finalized. Past experience has shown that freezing, or reducing the indexation of, the minimum wage and minimum benefits has not had a large impact. Furthermore, the effect on benefits of the administrative reform of the disability scheme introduced in previous years, 2J is neutralized in the short-term by the fact that former beneficiaries will initially be eligible for (equally high) unemployment benefits. Only after the latter expire after a period varying from six months to five years will there be an impact on benefits. Given these concerns, the staff representatives suggested not only a substantial easing of minimum wage requirements, but l.J On the positive side, the Netherlands has had a substantially lower minimum wage for youth and one of the lowest youth unemployment rates (relative to overall rates) among industrial countries.

Moreover, discontinuation of the legal binding of collective bargaining agreements across whole sectors assumes additional importance in this context, as these agreements generally provide for supplementary benefits. To complement labor market reform, the authorities have embarked on a medium-term program of deregulation of product markets. Specific measures are to be formulated each, year, such as the liberalization of shopping hours in 1995. These measures aim at reducing the heavy administrative burden on enterprises and strengthening competition in domestic markets for goods and services. In addition, a new competition law is being drafted to help underpin recent anti-cart:el efforts. 4. Balance of pavments and exchange rate The Dutch current account has been in surplus, equivalent to about 3 percent of GDP, since t:he early 1980s. On the issue of the persistence of current account surpluses, the authorities explained that they viewed it as mainly reflecting demographic developments, but also a change in business saving behavior and an increase in the share of business saving. The staff team agreed that demographic factors help explain the current high saving rate. The prospective increase in the share of the elderly in the Dutch population--which comes somewhat later than in other countries but would then be sharper- -would also indicate a fall in the saving rate in about a decade and a half. A forthcoming background paper inquires into the determinants of saving and investment to gain insight into the reasons behind the current account surplus; the following paragraphs provide a brief summary. Saving in the Netherlands has been high, at about 23 percent of GDP (Chart 8). As public sector saving has been negative, the high saving rate has reflected saving by the business and the household sectors. The main determinant of business saving has been profitability, which 'rose in the 1980s. Retained earnings of businesses have been bolstered by .a relatively high rate of taxation on paid out corporate income and the non-existence of capital gains taxation. The high rate of househoZd saving, stimulated by demographic factors, has mainly taken the form of large participation in the various pension schemes, while non-contractual saving has been low. lJ The fact that pension premiums are not taxed raises the reFJrn relative to other types of saving, contributing to the large share of contractual saving. Total investment in the Netherlands has fluctuated around 20 percent of GDP in the past decade. While this invest:ment ratio is not low, a number of factors probably had a negative impact. Wages in the Netherlands have lJ The fully funded nature of the sizable supplementary pension schemes would explain the higher saving rate relative to other countries with a similar demographic profile.

More importantly, a demand shift toward non-tradeable goods, in part caused by the rapid growth of the public sector, may also have lowered investment relative to saving, because the non-tradeable goods sector is normally more labor intensive. This effect appears to have been reinforced by cartel arrangements, barriers to entry, and other distortions in the sheltered sector. As discussed above, the current account surplus is projected to remain broadly unchanged at about 3 percent of GDP over the medium term. Fiscal consolidation would tend to put some upward pressure on it--cushioned by an accompanying decline in the private saving rate--while deregulation of the sheltered sector would tend to reduce it. The medium-term scenario also provides for full-employment output growth both in the Netherlands and abroad and low inflation. This scenario of internal and external balance is consistent with the level of the real exchange rate in the early part of this year (this implies some nominal effective appreciation over time, given the relatively low inflation in the Netherlands). The authorities did not consider the real effective appreciation in 1992-94 as posing a serious competitiveness problem, and suggested that competitiveness issues should be seen from a medium-term perspective. In this regard, they argued that the guilder's appreciation could be viewed as a correction of the gains in competitiveness during 1987-91, when nominal exchange rates within the EMS had remained stable in the presence of substantial inflation differentials. The staff shared the view that competitiveness was not an issue, given the strong external position and the gains in market shares. IV. Staff Appraisal The Netherlands achieved a number of important policy successes in the early 1990s: first, unlike many other countries in need of fiscal consolidation, it succeeded in reducing its fiscal deficit despite an unfavorable economic climate; second, a monetary policy remaining true to the objective of price and exchange rate stability kept the Dutch guilder protected from the turbulences in the EMS; and third, initiatives were taken to reverse the excessive growth of the welfare state during past decades. However, the task begun is not yet complete: the fiscal deficit and public debt remain too high; the burden arising from large public expenditure, especially for social security, is still heavy; unemployment, both open and hidden in social security programs, continues to be high; and labor and product markets remain subject to rigidities that impede their efficient functioning. These problems thus define the policy agenda for the period ahead. As emphasized in the Madrid Declaration of the Interim Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - Committee last October, :it is important to make good use of the current economic recovery in pursuing the required macroeconomic adjustments. With respect to fiscal policy, the plan put forward by the authorities should go a long way toward putting the fiscal house in order. It places the emphasis--rightly so- -on expenditure reduction, in particular lower social security spending. The curtailment of expenditure allows also a lowering of taxes and social security premiums. Pressure will be strong to dilute this approach, and the government will have to remain firmly wedded to its plan. In the area of social security, some of the cost cutting objectives have yet to be translated into firm measures, while the effectiveness of other measures still has to be proven. The progress in reducing social security spending will have to be monitored closely and additional measures introduced if necessary. The fiscal strategy stands or falls with the success of expenditure reduction. Another key issue is the use to be made of the likely faster-than- programmed revenue growth now expected in 1996 and also, possibly, beyond. The pressure to use this "windfall" to lower the large collective burden in order to strengthen the attack on the unemployment problem is understandable. It is, nonetheless, misplaced. A lasting further reduction in taxes and social security charges--desirable as it is--requires additional permanent reductions in spending. Cyclical revenue gains should be reflected in the deficit through the working of automatic stabilizers. As a minimum, the higher tax revenue should be used to reduce the deficit and the high public debt. It would also be in the spirit of the pay-as-you- go social security system, if the higher revenues from social security contributions were used to reduce the budgetary transfers to the social security system. Without letting automatic stabilizers work, the general government deficit would barely fall below 3 percent of GDP and deteriorate in structural terms, while public debt, as a ratio of GDP, would only show a small decline during a period of cyclical strength. Such a situation would give rise to several concerns. First, an ,unchanged deficit during the economic upswing would tend to exacerbate inflationary pressures, while severely limiting the room to provide support in a future recession. Second, the opportunity missed to cut the deficit and lower debt while economic growth is strong could well undermine confidence, all the more so if the Netherlands were to be seen to fall behind Germany in fiscal consolidation. And third, large expertditu,res arising in the long-run from the aging of the population argue for debt reduction now. In fact, an aggressive approach toward debt reduction will be required beyond the current program to prevent an excessive fiscal burden from population aging in the long-run. Concerning the tax system, a review would be called for to ensure that there are no distortions affecting the saving-investment behavior. Past crises in the EMS and the tensions in foreign exchange markets in recent weeks left the guilder unscathed. Its strength, unquestioned by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - financial market.s that quickly react to weaknesses in economic policy, is mainly the result of a monetary policy that has convincingly emphasized price and exchange rate stability over an extended period of time. A key element of this policy has been the tight link to the deutsche mark, and this link should be maintained. It has given Dutch monetary policy strong credibility and has resulted in interest rates being among the lowest in Europe. The close economic integration with Germany, and other countries tying their currencies to the deutsche mark, provides a powerful argument for a fixed exchange rate link to the deutsche mark. The developments in the Dutch labor market in the past two decades suggest that a number of factors have been responsible for the high unemployment, or non-employment, especially of the lower skilled: high labor costs, in particular, at the lower end of the wage scale, caused mainly by a large wedge of taxes and social security charges and high minimum wages; low incentives to work, given a generous social support system and the large wedge between gross and net pay; excessive regulation of labor markets; and overly regulated product markets. The present program contains measures that address all of these factors. The main question is whether the structural reform program is, indeed, sufficiently strong and comprehensive to raise the currently low economically active proportion of the population. Of course, the program needs to be given time to work. But it would seem fitting to strengthen it in some areas. This strengthening would include a more radical departure from the past practice of declaring collective bargaining agreements legally binding across whole sectors; these agreements have been a key factor in pushing up labor costs and limiting competition. Other areas would be a generous dispensation from minimum wage requirements, and the de-linking of benefits from minimum wages. Beyond these adjustments, a more aggressive reduction in the labor cost wedge than now envisaged may well be needed to stimulate the demand for labor. Such action would, however, require additional reductions of the generous social benefits, especially for disability and sick leave, and unemployment. The simultaneous pursuit of product market deregulation is also important to absorb an increasing number of people returning to the labor market. It is proposed that the Kingdom of the Netherlands remain on the 12-month consultation cycle.
