Introduction Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation were held in Guatemala City during November 28-December 16, 1994 and continued in Washington D.C. during January 26-27, 1995. The representatives of Guatemala included the Ministers of Finance, and Energy and Mining, the President of the Bank of Guatemala, and senior officials from government agencies and public enter- prises. Mr. Suarez, Advisor to the Executive Director for Guatemala, participated in the policy discussions. u The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 21, 1994 (SM/94/50). During the Board discussions, Directors stressed that the strengthening of fiscal policy was key to the success of the authorities' economic program for 1994. Directors underscored the importance of increasing the low ratio of tax revenue to GDP and containing current expenditures in order to increase investment and social spending, and allow more room for credit to the private sector. The implementation of the program for 1994 was monitored by the staff on an informal basis. Guatemala is on the standard 12-month cycle and has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section* 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. Relation* with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices III and IV, respectively. II. Background Information Following a successful stabilization effort in 1991, Guatemala has had difficulties in consolidating macroeconomic adjustment. Credit policy was relaxed in 1992 and progress in reducing inflation could not be sustained while the external current account deficit widened markedly. In 1993, the overall position of the combined public sector (including the losses of the Bank of Guatemala) shifted from near balance in 1992 to a deficit of 2.4 per- cent of GDP. However, credit to the private sector was tightened and infla- tion fell to 11 l/2 percent, from 14 percent in 1992. The external current account deficit declined somewhat, and strong inflows of private capital contributed to an increase in net international reserves of US$200 million. The import coverage of gross reserves rose to 3 l/2 months of imports at the end of 1993. Real GDP growth slowed to 4 percent, from about 5 percent in 1992. The authorities' program for 1994 aimed at strengthening public sector savings by 1.2 percentage points of GDP to 2.2 percent of GDP to reduce the overall deficit of the combined public sector to about 1 percent of GDP. The proposed adjustment was based in part on the adoption of a tax package in the second half of the year. Inflation was targeted to decline to 8.5 percent during 1994, and net international reserves were to be u The staff representatives were Messrs. Di Tata (Head), Ronci, and Terrones, and Mesdames Da Cost* and Synkova (all WHD).

The economy continued to expand at a 4 percent pace in 1994 owing to strong activity in the commercial and financial sectors. Inflation, how- ever, remained at 11 l/2 percent. The combined public sector deficit declined in the first half of 1994 as a compression of expenditures more than offset a shortfall in government revenues. l-/ Slippages with respect to the program developed in the second half of the year as problems persis- ted in tax administration and the adoption of the tax package was postponed. There were also delays in adjusting electricity tariffs which weakened the financial position of the state power company (INDE). u As a result, instead of increasing as planned, public sector savings declined from 1 per- cent of GDP in 1993 to *bout l/2 percent of GDP in 1994, while the combined public sector deficit rose slightly to 2.7 percent of GDP (Table 1). In particular, the ratio of tax revenue to GDP, which had been projected to increase to 8.8 percent in 1994, fell to less than 7 percent of GDP (Table 2). The fiscal deficit was more than covered by external loans and grants, arrears to bilateral creditors, and placements of bonds with foreign banks and the nonbank private sector, which allowed the public sector to reduce its net indebtedness to the domestic banking system by almost 1 percent of GDP. Money and quasi-money grew by 18 percent during 1994, well above the targeted rate of 12 percent, while credit to the private sector jumped by one third as banks drew on external credit lines to supplement their deposit base (Tables 3 and 4). Strong inflows of private capital during January-July contributed to an increase in net official reserves of about US$llO million. During August-December 1994, credit was relaxed through a reduction in legal reserve requirements and net redemptions of open market paper by the Bank of Guatemala. 1/ There was a marked decline in domestic interest rates (deposit and lending rates fell by 4 percentage points during this period, to 12.5 and 20.2 percent, respectively), and *bout half of the gain in international reserves in the first half of the year was reversed. For the year as a whole, net international reserve* increased by US$60 million, or the equivalent of 5 percent of the monetary base. In March 1994 the authorities introduced a new exchange system based on an interbank market in which the Central Bank intervenes to *void large exchange rate fluctuations (the exchange rate fluctuated within a range u In March 1994 the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the withholdings on estimated future income contemplated in the Income Tax Law. u An increase in electricity tariffs decreed by the Government in September 1994 subsequently was suspended by a court ruling. 1/ The degree of fiscal adjustment envisaged under the program was expected to allow for a reduction in reserve requirements of 10 percentage points in 1994, to 26 l/2 percent of deposits. However, reserve require- ments were reduced by 3 percentage points only.

The external current account deficit declined slightly from 6.6 percent of GDP in 1993 to about 6.0 percent of GDP in 1994 (Table 5). The value of exports increased by 12 l/2 percent as a result of more favorable prices for coffee, sugar and cardamom, and continued strong growth of nontraditional exports. Imports grew by about 8 percent on account of increased demand for consumer goods associated with the rapid growth of credit to the private sector. Official capital inflows were somewhat higher than expected as shortfalls in project financing and trade related loans to the Bank of Guatemala were more than offset by placements of bonds with foreign banks. u Private capital inflows amounted to US$540 million (4.2 percent of GDP) in 1994, compared with US$890 million (7.9 percent of GDP) in 1993. In 1994 the National Assembly ratified five bilateral agreements under the Paris Club Agreed Minute of March 1993. However, there have been delays in concluding the negotiations with Spain on a debt originally contracted by an official financial institution (CORFINA). Total arrears to external creditors were estimated at US$30 million at end-1994 (excluding arrears to Spain). This amount includes arrears to Paris Club creditors, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), and a foreign commercial bank. Arrears to Argentina for ~~$8.6 million were cleared during 1994, in part through debt forgiveness. In the first two months of 1995 the Government increased its net placements of short-term debt in the domestic market and repaid external debt for US$125 million, including most of the outstanding short-term bonded debt to foreign banks, about US$llO million. To keep interest rates from rising, however, the Bank of Guatemala redeemed a substantial amount of maturing open-market paper. As a result, net international reserves declined by about US$lSO million. Following some firming of interest rates in March, the net international reserve position stabilired. However, reserves declined further by about US$SO million in the first three weeks of April (gross reserves have fallen to 2.3 months of imports, from 3.1 months of imports at end-1994). Consumer prices increased by only 0.2 percent in January-March 1995 because of a drop in food prices owing to good supplies, and the 12-month rate of inflation declined to 7.8 percent in March. The u Previously Guatemala maintained a system of foreign exchange auctions and direct surrender of export receipts to the Central Bank, under which the exchange rate was allowed to move within a narrow band. The band was shifted upward or downward whenever the exchange rate was higher or lower than the midpoint of the band for 15 consecutive days. u Balance of payments support included US$24 million from the World Bank under the Economic Modernisation Loan (EML), US$97 million from the Inter- American Development Bank under the Financial Modemization Loan (FML), and US$30 million from the Export-Import Bank of Taiwan Province of China.

On the political front, constitutional reforms approved in January 1994 brought forward Congressional elections from November 1995 to August 1994 and reduced the terms of the President and Congress from five to four years. In January 1994 the Government resumed the peace negotiations with former guerrilla groups under the auspices of the United Nations. An agreement establishing a Commission to report on human rights violations was concluded in June 1994, and a preliminary agreement on the rights of indigenous commu- nities was signed in March 1995. The Government expects to conclude the peace accords in 1995. Presidential and Congressional elections are scheduled for November 1995. III. Policy Discussions and the Authorities' Proeram for 1995 Guatemala's efforts in the last two years to raise additional revenue and se-orient expenditure toward social services and investment have met with limited success. While there has been a curtailment of spending, the revenue gains and the improvement in the overall fiscal position that had been expected did not materialize, and the government increasingly has relied on bonded debt and increases in the floating debt to finance its operations. The authorities continue to recognize the importance of dealing with the fiscal deficit and addressing long-neglected basic services, such as health and education, to increase labos productivity and sustain economic growth. A strong savings effort on the part of the public sector was seen as essential to modemize the infrastmcture, ease pressure on interest rates, stimulate new private undertakings, and reduce the country's depend- ence on foreign savings. Given the low tax effort in Guatemala, meeting these challenges requires a substantial increase in tax revenue, although there is still room to increase the efficiency of expenditure. The discussions with the authorities centered on the outlook and policies for 1995 and the medium term, including the measures and reforms needed to improve the fiscal position. During 1994 the staff assisted the authorities in identifying a number of areas in which there was significant scope for raising revenues. u The authorities have made efforts to strengthen the revenue base, and in late 1994 the Assembly approved a tax package incorporating several initiatives. However, on the basis of a challenge by the principal business group, early in April 1995 the Consti- tutional Court suspended the application of some of the measures included in the package. Subsequently, the Assembly modified and reinstated some of the u Two missions from FAD visited Guatemala in March 1994 to provide technical assistance on tax policy and tax administration. In addition in early November 1994 a staff team visited Guatemala at the request of the authorities to help elicit domestic support for revenue measures.

The authorities have stressed that their overriding near-term objective is to achieve a significant reduction of the combined public sector deficit during 1995, and that they would work on building political support for further actions to compensate fully for the effect of the Court's decision on government revenues. The authorities have established quarterly quantitative targets for the 1995 program (Appendix I), and requested continued staff monitoring on an informal basis. This would involve frequent contacts with the authorities, an enhanced flow of information, and a staff visit during the second half of 1995 to review policies and developments under the program. Successful implementation of the program is expected to serve as a basis for the con- tinuation of sector loan disbursements from the World Bank and the Inter- American Development Bank. Also, in June 1995 the Government intends to convene a Consultative Group meeting to obtain donor support for peace-related expenditures. 1. Macroeconomic framework for 1995 The authorities' program for 1995 aims at strengthening public sector savings (after taking account of the losses of the Bank of Guatemala) by 1.6 percentage points of GDP, to 2.0 percent of GDP. This would accommodate a modest increase in investment, with emphasis in improving health standards and the provision of other social services, and permit a decline in the combined public sector deficit to 1.3 percent of GDP, from 2.7 percent of GDP in 1994. The fiscal adjustment is to be supported by a tighter credit policy stance during the remainder of the year. Inflation is targeted at 8 percent, and the external current account deficit would be halved to about 3 percent of GDP. Net international reserves would remain unchanged for 1995 as a whole, thus recovering the loss of US$200 million that occurred in the first months of the year. Real GDP growth is projected at 3 percent in 1995 as activity slows somewhat in the commercial and financial sectors, after four years of fairly rapid expansion. Partial information indicates that the operations of the Central Government in the first quarter of 1995 were in line with the program. Tax revenue was about 6 percent higher than programmed as better than expected collections from the value-added tax and customs duties more than offset shortfalls in income tax revenue. At the same time, central govem- ment expenditure was 6 percent below program projections because of under- spending on wages and capital transfers. However, the increase in the net domestic assets of the Bank of Guatemala during the first quarter exceeded the ceiling established mainly because during February-March the Bank continued to inject liquidity through open-market operations, instead of engaging in net placements of open-market paper as envisaged in the program. As a result, the international reserve target for end-March 1995 was missed by about USS25 million. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - 2. Fiscal policy The overall deficit of the nonfinancial public sector is projected to decline from 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 to 0.3 percent in 1995, while the losses of the Bank of Guatemala would fall from 1.2 percent of GDP in 1994 to 1.0 percent in 1995 following a substantial amortization of central bank external debt and the reduction in the stock of open-market paper that took place in 1994. The nonfinancial public sector is not expected to seek financing from the domestic banking system in 1995, and would cover its financing requirement mainly through net placements of bonds with the nonbank private sector. lJ Central Government revenue is targeted to rise by 1.1 percentage points of GDP to 8.7 percent in 1995 owing to a number of revenue actions and improvements in tax administration. In November 1994 the Assembly approved a tax package that comprised (i) a new minimum tax of 1 l/2 percent on the assets of corporations, to be credited against the corporate income tax; (ii) an increase in the income tax rate for corporations and in the maximum rate for individuals from 25 percent to 30 percent; (iii) payment of the income tax on a quarterly basis; (iv) the obligation to withhold tax on the income generated by certain transactions, including interest income; (v) adjustments in reference prices used for the calculation of certain excise taxes; and (vi) elimination of certain VAT exemptions, the VAT credit for investment, and the right to obtain a refund of the VAT credit, except for exporters. Subsequently, the Assembly also approved an increase in the tax on motor vehicles and reforms to the Penal Code that establish penal responsibility.for tax fraud. MOI-l?OVfZ, a revised tax code that introduces stiffer penalties for tax evaders has been submitted to the Assembly, and new procedures to strengthen customs administration are being put in place. As noted, in early April 1995 the Constitutional Court suspended the application of some of the revenue measures included in the package. u The suspended actions included the tax on assets of corporations, the obli- gation to withhold tax on income from certain transactions, and the appli- cation of jail sentences for tax fraud. To compensate in part for the loss of revenue, in late April 1995 the Assembly approved legislation establish- ing a tax on the net assets of corporations (credit obligations and other liabilities were excluded from the ta% base) and the taxation of interest &f The program assumes that quetzal-denominated bonded debt for an amount equivalent to 1 l/2 percent of GDP that matures during April-December 1995, and mainly held domestically, would be rolled over. ZJ In March 1995 the business sector introduced several appeals before the Constitutional Court. The appeals challenged the introduction of jail sentences for tax fraud, the tax on assets, payment of the income tax on a quarterly basis, the elimination of the VAT credit for investment, and the obligation to withhold tax on certain transactions.

I/ However, additional compensatory measures for about 0.3 percent of GDP still would be required to achieve the increase in revenues of 1.1 percent of GDP envisaged in the authorities' program. On the expenditure side, current outlays are projected to decline somewhat relative to GDP, as the authorities plan to maintain a freeze on wages and salaries of central government employees u and already have introduced new procurement procedures that would allow for some reduction in outlays on goods and services. Capital expenditure is projected to rise in 1995 because of increased spending on peace-related projects. Military outlays are budgeted to remain at about 1 percent of GDP in 1995. The authorities intend to adopt some measures aimed at strengthening the financial position of the public enterprises and the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS). In particular, a long-delayed adjustment of electricity tariffs to make them equivalent to 90-100 percent of the long- run marginal cost of generating electricity is to become effective in May 1995, and steps also are being taken by IGSS to reduce evasion and expedite the collection of arrears. The revenue projections of the program do not incorporate any effect from an increase in the value added tax rate from 7 to 10 percent that was approved by the Assembly as part of the tax package, which is to become effective one month after the signing of the peace accords, or on January 1, 1996, whichever is earlier. Y The increase in the VAT rate is expected to yield additional revenues equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP on an annual basis. The fiscal projections also exclude the impact of privatizing the Guatemala Railroads Company (FEGUA), which the authorities expect to complete by end-June 1995. The proceeds from this operation would be used to reduce government debt to the Bank of Guatemala. During the discussions the staff encouraged the authorities to take additional actions to move closer to a position of fiscal balance in 1995. The staff noted that recent developments in the region had diminished Guatemala's ability to rely on large inflows of private capital to finance lJ As part of the compensatory actions, the administration also had unified the tariffs on imports from outside the Central American region, with some exceptions, et 10 percent (prior to the unification, the average import tariff was close to 8 l/2 percent). However, this measure was rescinded two weeks later following pressures from sectors that were affected by the reduction in tariff dispersion. 2-/ The wage bill would increase only on account of selective adjustments and new positions in the education sector, and the full year-effect of a bonus of 4.100-120 per month provided to government employees starting in May 1994. 2/ The additional revenue from the VAT is earmarked for peace-related expenditures. The authorities indicated that this additional revenue would finance peace-related outlays already included in the budget.

The staff also stressed the need to alleviate the burden on monetary policy and ease pressures on domestic interest rates. In addition, the uncertainties about the yield of the revenue measures, particularly those of an administrative nature, were emphasized. In view of the still low ratio of tax revenue to GDP projected for 1995, several options were discussed to further strengthen revenues, including a tax on coffee exports (in line with similar taxes in other Central American countries), an increase in gasoline prices, &f a selec- tive consumption tax, u and advancing the effective date for raising the VAT rate. Moreover, the staff noted that there was scope for further reducing VAT exemptions, limiting certain income za.x deductions, and increasing collections from excise taxes along lines suggested by FAD. The authorities responded that given the difficulties encountered with the tax package and rhe proximity of elections, it would be difficult to obtain domestic political support for additional revenue actions beyond what was required to attain the increase in revenues contemplated in their program. They indicated that they would restrain both current and capital expend- itures further, excluding outlays on health and education, if the revenue performance did not meet with expectations. 3. Financial system a. Monetary and interest rate policies The credit program is consistent with the authorities' inflation and balance of payments objectives, and is based on a reduction in the rate of growth of broad money to 12 percent, from 18 percent in 1994, in line with projected nominal GDP growth (see Table 4). Credit expansion to the private sector would decline to 10 l/2 percent, from 33 percent in 1994, partly as a result of a sharp reduction in short-term external borrowing by commercial banks. To reverse the decline in net inrernational reserves in the first months of 1995, the staff emphasized the importance of intensifying the placement of central bank paper and government bonds by offering interest rates sufficiently attractive to ensure the required absorption of liquidity and facilitate the rollover of maturing government bonded debt. During March 1995 the authorities placed paper at somewhat higher interest rates than earlier in the year (the rate offered on 160-&y open market instru- ments rose by 3 percentage points to 18 percent in March 1995), which helped to stabilize the net official reserve position in that month. However, as noted earlier, the reserve target that the authorities had envisaged for JJ The price of regular gasoline is USsl.4 per gallon.

Financial sector reform During the 1980s the Guatemalan financial system was subject to interest rate controls and regulatory barriers that limited competition. Domestic interest rates were liberalized in late 1989, and subsequently the Monetary Board allowed the entry of new financial institutions (the number of commercial banks increased from 19 in 1989 to 31 in 1995). Since September 1993 the authorities have been implementing a compre- hensive program of financial sector reform supported by the Economic Modernization LOan from the World Bank and the Financial Modernization Loan from the IDB. Under this program, the Monetary Board has issued new norms regulating entry in the banking industry, allowing banks to perform a wider scope of operations, and establishing criteria on portfolio classification. Recently, the Assembly also approved legislation that strengthens the man- date of the Superintendency of Banks and establishes prudential norms on capital adequacy along the lines of the Bale Agreement. lJ In addition, one state-owned financial institution (BANDESA) is being restructured, and another two (BANVI and CORFINA) are in the process of being liquidated. Reliance on high reserve requirements has resulted in high spreads and serious distortions. In particular, banks have engaged in off-balance sheet operations and the activities of nonregulated financial intermediaries have expanded, complicating the management of monetary policy. The authorities indicated that their ultimate objective was to lower reserve requirements, but they recognized that great caution needs to be exercised until the public finances are on a sound basis. As noted above, in 1994 commercial banks increased their short-term external borrowing, and this situation continued during the first quarter of 1995. u In view of the banks' increased exposure to exchange risks, the staff advised the authorities to develop prudential regulations on banks' open positions in foreign exchange. The staff also stressed the need to improve information on the quality of banks' assets based on the new criteria on portfolio classification. 4. External sector Dolicies The external current account deficit is projected to decline from 6 percent of GDP in 1994 to below 3 percent of GDP in 1995 (see Table 5). The U.S. dollar value of exports is projected to grow strongly in 1995 1/ The authorities noted that in practice most financial institutions were already in compliance with the Basle requirements on capital adequacy. u Short-term external borrowing by commercial banks amounted to about X$250 million (1.8 percent of GDP) in 1994. The external credit lines were used mainly to finance trade credits of short maturities.

Imports are projected to grow at a slower rate of 2 l/2 percent in 1995, in response to the tighter financial policies. On the capital account side, net inflows of official capital would decline because of net redemptions of external bonds and a fall in balance of payments support. Disbursements of balance of payments loans in 1995 would include US$48 million from the World Bank and US$55 million from the IDB. Moreover, the program assumes a drop in inflows of private capital from US$540 million in 1994 to US$350 million in 1995, due to higher interest rates abroad, regional uncerzainties, and the political calendar. However, there is considerable risk that even this more moderate level of private inflows might not materialize. The authorities indicated that all external arrears would be eliminated by end-September 1995. Regarding the bilateral negotiations with Spain, the authorities have taken the decision to submit to the Assembly rhe approval of a government guarantee on the loan originally contracted by CORFINA as soon as a rescheduling proposal is agreed with the Spanish Government. Since end-1989 the quetzal has appreciated by about 18 percent in real effective terms. Despite the appreciation, nontraditional exports grew by 14 percent a year, partly because of strong demand from the Central American market. However, the depreciation of the Mexican peso could have some adverse effects on Guatemala's external competitiveness, as some of Guatemala's nontraditional exports (about 25 percent of total nontraditional exports) compete with those of Mexico in the United States and other mar- kets. In the discussions the authorities agreed with the sraff on the need to allow the exchange rate to respond more freely to market forces in the context of tighter financial policies, in order to prevent a loss of compe- tiriveness and help achieve the balance of payments objectives. As noted, the quetzal has depreciated somewhat vis-g-vis the U.S. dollar since end- 1994. However, the reserve loss has not been arrested, in part because of central bank intervention. Significant progress has been made in recent years in the area of trade liberalisation. The average duty rate was reduced from 19 percent in 1991 to 8 l/2 percent in 1994. In March 1993, most duties on imports from out- side the Central American region were reduced to a range of 5-20 percent. from the previous range of 5-30 percent. JJ Duties on imports from coun- tries within the Central American region have been eliminated, with a few Jf In December 1994 duties on textiles and shoes were lowered from 30 to 20 percent, and on tires from 22 to 15 percent. Duties on clothing also were lowered, but from 30 to 25 percent. Some agricultural products remain subject to variable tariff rates agreed annually among the Central American countries, while chicken imports are subject to a special regime.

Structural and povertv alleviation uolicies Discussions on structural issues focused on the Government's plans in the areas of privatization and competition policies. In late December 1994 the Assembly approved legislation establishing the autonomy of INDE and allowing private sector participation in the generation of electricity. Moreover, the Government is preparing a draft law that would establish a regulatory framework for the electricity sector. As noted, the Government has formulated a timetable for the privatization of FEGUA, and intends to proceed with the bidding process before end-June 1995. In addition, consid- eration is being given to privatizing the state telephone company (GUATEL), but a concrete timetable needs to be defined. Poverty in Guatemala is widespread and most pervasive in the rural areas. ZJ Over the medium-term, progress in alleviating poverry would depend on the Government's success in creating the conditions for rapid and sustained growth in the standards of living, including mobilizing resources through the tax system for investment in human capital. Improving the effi- ciency of existing social programs and budgetary control procedures also would be a key component in the effort to reduce poverty. A number of special administered funds that finance small projects aimed at the provi- sion of basic social services as well as peace related programs have been created in recent years, and the fiscal program contemplates an increase in government transfers to these funds from 0.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to 0.7 percent of GDP in 1995. The authorities expect to obtain additional resources for peace-related expenditures from the donor community. IV. Medium-Term Outlook A medium-term balance of payments scenario has been prepared on the assumption that appropriate macroeconomic policies are pursued and that structural reforms are intensified. In particular, the scenario assumes that the public sector shifts to balance in 1996 and remains in equilibrium in subsequent years as a result of a determined effort to achieve a subs- tantial increase in revenues, and that supportive monetary and exchange rate policies are in place. National savings are expected to increase markedly over 1995-96 on account of the strengthening of public savings and an increase in private savings associated with rhe rise in coffee prices; lJ Some products traded within the Central American region, such as coffee, sugar, oil, wheat, and alcohol, remain subject to tariffs in the range of 5-20 percent. Trade in these products is small. u A FAD mission visited Guatemala in July 1994 to provide technical assistance on poverty alleviation and safety nets.

Domestic investment is expected to increase to about 17 l/2 percent of GDP by 1999, and real GDP growth is projected at 4 percent a year during 1996-99. Based on these assumptions, the external current account deficit would decline to about 2 l/2 percent of GDP in 1996-99 (Table 6). After rising strongly in 1995. the U.S. value of traditional exports is projected to level in 1996, and to fall by about 10 percent a year in 1997-98 on account of falling coffee prices. At the same time, nontraditional exports would continue to grow by about 12 percent a year in 1996-99, while imports are projected to increase by 5 percent a year. Disbursements of official loans and grants are projected at a rela- tively high level during 1996-99, in part because of external support for peace-related projects, while private capital inflows would decline further to US$230 million a year, consisting mostly of direct investment flows and trade credits. Based on these projections, gross official reserves would remain at a level equivalent to about three months of imports. The external debt is projected to fall from 18 percent of GDP in 1994 to about 15 percent of GDP in 1998-99, while the debt service ratio would decline from 13.2 percent in 1994 to about 10 percent in 1998-99. These projections are subject to considerable uncertainty, particularly with regard to coffee prices and private capital inflows. An alternative scenario shows that if coffee prices were to be 10 percent lower than in the baseline, the average rate of growth of imports would need to decline from about 5 percent to 3 l/2 percent a year over 1996-99 to maintain the same external current account deficit. Moreover, a reduction of 50 percent in private capital inflows with respect to the baseline would require that the external current account deficit be lowered to an annual average of 1 l/2 percent of GDP over 1996-99, compared with 2 l/2 percent in the baseline. In both cases, monetary and fiscal policies would need to be adjusted further. V. Staff Auuraisal In 1994 public sector savings declined and the combined public sector deficit increased slightly to 2 3/4 percent of GDP because of continued difficulties in tax administration and the postponement of revenue measures (the ratio of tax revenue to GDP fell to less than 7 percent). The economy continued to expand at a rate of 4 percent in 1994, inflation remained at about 11 l/2 percent, and the external current account deficit declined slightly to 6 percent of GDP and was more than financed by strong inflows of private capital and some official inflows. There was a strong gain in official international reserves in the first half of 1994, but part of these gains were reversed during the second half when inflows of private capital slowed. In the first quarter of 1995 the 12-month rate of inflation fell below 8 percent, but the foreign reserve position deteriorated further with the continuation of a loose credit policy and the repayment of short-term external debt by the Government. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - Guatemala has not succeeded in dealing with its fiscal deficit during the last two years, and the resources devoted to basic social needs and the building of an adequate infrastructure continue to be insufficient. At the same time, recent developments in the region have diminished the country‘s ability to rely on large inflows of private capital to finance its external current account deficit. These circumstances, highlighted by the recent deterioration of the official reserve position, have added urgency to the need for a strong program of macroeconomic adjustment. Such a program should focus on a substantial strengthening of the fiscal position, a tigh- ter credit policy, and a more flexible approach to exchange rate management to prevent a loss of competitiveness in the aftermath of the depreciation of the Mexican peso. The authorities' program for 1995 aims at increasing public savings through various revenue actions. It represents a renewed attempt to begin to address the need for increased investment and social spending, while reducing the combined public sector deficit to 1.3 percent of GDP. Infla- tion is targeted at 8 percent during 1995, and the recent loss of inter- national reserves is expected to be reversed during the remainder of the year. The authorities have requested that the staff continue to monitor their program on an informal basis. The authorities' program is a step in the direction of correcting Guatemala's macroeconomic imbalances. However, the fiscal plan goes only part way toward eliminating the public sector deficit and places an undue burden on monetary policy. Moreover, the proposed adjustment may be insuf- ficient to protect the balance of payments, as there is considerable risk that the inflows of private capital envisaged in the program may not be forthcoming. While the program contemplates an increase in revenues, Guatemala's tax burden still would remain low by regional standards. Furthermore, there are uncertainties about the yield of some of the revenue actions, particularly those of an administrative nature, and additional measures still would be required to achieve the proposed fiscal targets. Tax collections would need to be monitored closely in the period ahead and further fiscal actions should not be delayed if revenues perform below expectations. The autho- rities have indicated that they would offset any revenue shortfalls by further curtailing government spending. In any event, any actions in this regard, in the Guatemalan context, should preserve sufficient protection to the social sectors. Other options that have been discussed and should be considered include a tax on windfall coffee revenues, an increase in gaso- line prices, the introduction of a selective consumption tax, and advancing the effective date for raising the VAT rate. Moreover, there is scope for further reducing VAT exemptions, limiting certain tax deductions, and increasing collections from excise taxes along lines suggested by FAD. Prompt approval and implementation of the revised tax code also are essential to achieve the planned improvements in tax administration. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - Given the difficulties in raising revenues, the authorities would need to exercise strict control on expenditures in 1995. Every effort should be made to maintain the freeze on wages and salaries, and to adhere to the limits set out for government transfers and outlays on goods and services. The staff also urges the authorities to adjust without delay electricity tariffs to the long-run marginal cost of generating electricity, and to ensure that tariffs continue to be adjusted on a regular basis to reflect cost increases in the future. The Social Security Institute should intensify efforts to collect arrears and reduce evasion. Under a limited fiscal effort, achievement of the authorities' infla- tion and balance of payments objectives will depend critically on a tighter monerary stance and greater exchange rate flexibility than currently being pursued, particularly in view that recent exchange rate developments in Mexico could affect the competitiveness of Guatemala's traded goods sector. Specifically, the authorities should move more decisively with the placement of central bank paper and government bonds by offering interest rates suffi- ciently attractive to ensure the required absorption of liquidity and roll- over of bonded debt. Also, the staff recommends that the exchange rate be allowed to respond to market forces, and that the Central Bank limit its intervention in the interbank foreign exchange market to meet the re.serve target. On the structural front, the staff would stress the importance of expediting the privatization of the railroads and telecommunications, and of a prompt approval of the draft law for the electricity sector. The legis- lation on banking regulation recently approved by the Assembly provides an important tool to strengthen supervision and capital requirements. The authorities also should introduce specific regulations on commercial banks' open foreign exchange positions, and improve the information on the quality of banks' assets based on the new criteria on portfolio classification. High reserve requirements have created distortions in financial intermedia- tion, but the staff would recommend caution in lowering reserve requirements until the public finances are sufficiently strengthened. During 1994 five bilateral agreements under the Paris Club Agreed Minute of March 1993 were ratified by the National Assembly. However, efforts should continue to conclude promptly the negotiations with Spain and to meet all the external obligations on a timely basis. Guatemala maintains exchange restrictions as evidenced by certain external payments arrears owed to Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors. In view of the authorities' intention to eliminate these arrears before end-September 1995, the staff recommends approval for the retention of these restricrions until that date. Guatemala's external current account deficit has been large in recent years; its balance of payments position is vulnerable to shifts in private capital flows; the progress made in reducing inflation remains fragile; and the country faces serious problems in the social areas that will hamper sustained improvements in living standards if not addressed. The autho- rities need to strengthen their efforts to eliminate the fiscal deficit in the context of supportive monetary and exchange rate policies, while paying Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 increased attention to investment in infrastructure and the development of human capital. Meeting these challenges will require a determined effort to mobilize additional resources through the tax system in 1995 and the years beyond. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - VI. ProDosed Decision The following draft decision is proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Guatemala's exchange measures subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2, in the light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Guatemala conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Guatemala maintains exchange restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a), as evidenced by certain external payments arrears. In view of the authorities' program to eliminate these arrears by end-September 1995. the Fund grants approval for the retention of the above restrictions until September 30, 1995.

Exchanee Rate Arraneements In March 1994 Guatemala abolished the system of daily foreign exchange auctions and direct surrender of export proceeds to the Central Bank, and adopted a system based on an interbank foreign exchange market in which authorized financial institutions buy and sell foreign exchange at market-determined rates. Financial institutions authorized to operate in the foreign exchange market include commercial banks, finance companies, and exchange houses, which act as agents of the Central Bank. The Central Bank intervenes in the market to avoid large exchange rate fluctuations as well as to purchase foreign exchange for meeting public sector external debt obligations and maintaining a cushion of international reserves. As of March 31, 1995, the exchange rate in the interbank market was 5.713 quetzales per U.S. dollar. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 21, 1994 (F&M/94/23; the relevant documents were SM/94/50 and SH/94/60). Guatemala is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. IX. Technical Assistance a. FAD: Technical assistance on tax policy and tax administration was provided by two missions in March 1994. Assistance on poverty alleviation and social safety nets was provided in July 1994. b. H&E: A mission in January-February 1994 reviewed monetary policy instruments and financial programming, assessed public debt management methods, and provided advice on the establishment of an interbank exchange market.

Recent economic and sector missions The most recent economic report on Guatemala (Economic Modernization Loan, FzKL) was distributed to the Bank's Board of Directors on November 2, 1992 (Report No. P-5858-GU) and approved on November 24, 1992, together with a loan for the Social Investment Fund (SIF). A restructuring of the EML was approved by the Bank's Board on January 13, 1994. The US$24 million second tranche of the restructured EML was disbursed on January 31, 1994. An extension of the loan's closing date up to June 30, 1995 was approved on September 16, 1994. The Bank also is preparing operations in the agricul- tural, financial management, education, end environmental services sectors.

Public finance Information on revenues and expenditures of the major public enter- prises (INDE and GUATEL) and the Social Security Institute is available on an irregular basis with a four-month lag. In addition, there are some problems of classification that need CO be addressed. Information about other decentralized agencies and enterprises is available with a one-year lag. b. Statistics on external debt/arrears Data on external debt flows and arrears are available on a monthly basis. However, there are some problems of coverage, in particular with regard to some operations with external creditors in domestic currency. c. Bankine svstem accounts The Superintendency of Banks has introduced recently a new accounting system for commercial banks and finance companies. Some problems have emerged as a result of the new classification of accounts, but the Superintendency of Banks and the Bank of Guatemala are working closely with the financial institutions to solve these problems.
