Anthony Elson and John Hicklin October 30,200O l The Article IV consultation discussions were held in Nuku’alofa during August 2 l-3 1, 2000. l In concluding the 1998 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors noted that expansionary macroeconomic policies had resulted in the erosion of foreign reserves and that structural weaknesses had constrained economic growth. Accordingly, Directors urged the authorities to further tighten monetary policy and adopt a prudent wage policy to contain demand. Diversified private sector development was seen as a priority, including through establishing a transparent business environment and broad-based tax and tariff regimes. Directors noted the high level of nonperforming loans in some banks and urged the authorities to strengthen on-site supervision. l Although macroeconomic policies during 1998/99-l 999/00 were directed toward maintaining stability, the external current account worsened and little progress was made in structural reforms. The recent pickup in growth has exerted new pressures on international reserves as the private sector supply capacity remains limited. Against this background, the mission recommended a number of stabilization measures, and structural reforms aimed at fostering private sector activities and building export capacity. l The mission met with HRH Prince ‘Ulukalala Lavaka Ata, Prime Minister; Hon. Tutoatasi Fakafanua, Minister of Finance; Mr. S.T.T. ‘Utoikamanu, Governor of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga; Hon. Semisi Sesolo Koka, Minister of Works and Disaster Relief Activities; other government officials; and representatives of the local business and donor community. l The mission comprised Messrs. Lee (Head), Nishigaki (both APD), Jimenez de Lucia (STA), and Ms. Tanaka (OAP); Mr. Kioa (OED) participated in some of the discussions. ~ l Tonga accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, on March 22, 1991.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS A. Background and Recent Developments 1. Tonga is a small island economy in the South Pacific with a population of about 100,000 and per capita income of $1,500 (Box l).’ It is an agriculture-based economy,* and shares a number of common characteristics with other island economies such as remoteness, openness, susceptibility to natural disasters, and limited diversification. In particular, it is highly dependent on tourism receipts and private transfers from Tongans abroad, which together cover about 85 percent of merchandise imports. 2. Following a three-year period of weak growth, real GDP growth in 1998/99 and 1999/00 is estimated at 3% percent and 5% percent, respectively (Tables 1 and 2; Box 2). In 1998/99, the increased production of processed food and building materials more than compensated for a decline in agricultural output, which was adversely affected by Cyclone Cora. Growth in 1999/00 was led by a large increase in trade and services sector related to the millennium celebration, together with the income effect from increased workers’ remittances. It was also supported by a rebound in agricultural production. Inflation rose to about 4 percent in 1998/99 (period-average), attributed mainly to higher world prices; an upward adjustment in tobacco prices led to a further increase in inflation to 5% percent in 1999/00. 3. Macroeconomic policies were geared toward maintaining stability in 1998199 1999/00. Fiscal deficits were kept low with little recourse to domestic bank financing as the implicit fiscal rule of maintaining a zero recurrent balance was broadly adhered to (Table 3).3 However, with declining net foreign loans and grants, capital expenditures dropped well below a sustainable level. While private sector credit growth was contained, net domestic assets rose by about 30 percent in 1999/00 on account of a significant increase in other items net, mainly reflecting large dividend payments by one commercial bank (Table 4). The National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) is severely constrained in carrying out monetary policy operations. With a large stock of outstanding NRBT bills and no budgetary support, ‘Tonga is a constitutional monarchy in which substantial powers are assigned to the king and the nobility. The king appoints the cabinet, headed by a prime minister. The government sector is large with its spending amounting to about 30 percent of GDP. *The share of manufacturing is about 5 percent of GDP. ‘The implicit fiscal rule, which dates back many years, requires recurrent expenditure to equal recurrent revenue. In practice, this rule ensured that current expenditure was generally limited to what was collected from domestic revenue sources. The fiscal year begins in July.

Tonga: An Island in the South Pacific Area and population size: Tonga is a Polynesian country, an archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean. With 720 square km., Tonga is the second smallest country group in the region together with the Federated States of Micronesia and Kiribati, after Marshall Islands. The size of the population is about 100,000; Tonga has the lowest population growth rate in the region, possibly as it excludes workers going abroad, while the population density is one of the highest.

Social indicators: Tonga’s GDP per capita is in the lower middle-income category, similar to most other countries in the region. However, other social indicators place Tonga relatively higher on the scale, e.g., adult literacy is almost 100 percent, and the life expectancy at birth is close to 70. Economic structure: As is the case for most other countries in the region, Tonga depends on primary sector activities and tourism. Lack of economies of scale, limited capital and human resources, and physical isolation hinder development of a strong manufacturing sector. Tonga’s main commodity exports are squash (which is unique to Tonga) and fish. Tourism receipts in Tonga account for around 30 percent of total exports of goods and services, which is similar to that of Fiji. Tonga is also unique in that it is heavily dependent on private transfers from Tongans living abroad.

Weather conditions and foreign grants (which are provided mainly for project financing) determine agricultural production and construction (and related supply industries), respectively. The service sector is largely influenced by tourism receipts and remittance income from Tongans living abroad. Background: The low real GDP growth during 1995/96-1997/98, which averaged about 1 percent, reflects poor performance in agricultural production, completion of large aid- financed projects, and stagnant tourism. Recovery began in 1998/99, supported Tonga: Contribution to GDP Growth, 1995/96-1999/00 by increases in the production of 6.0 (In percent) processed food and building materials for construction, even though n Secondary sector agriculture contracted due to the adverse effects of Cyclone Cora in 3.0 December 1998.

Preliminary data for 1999100 indicate a substantial worsening in the external position (Table 5). This outcome reflected rapid growth in imports, which raised the trade deficit to 34 percent of GDP, from 29 percent of GDP a year earlier. Furthermore, nonrecurrent payments such as the chartering of five additional aircraft by the Royal Tongan Airlines and dividend payments by a commercial bank to its foreign shareholders reduced net service and income receipts, partly offsetting receipts from the temporary boom in tourism and workers’ remittances. In addition, the capital account worsened as official loans declined further. Accordingly, foreign reserves declined from 3 L/z months of imports at end- 1998/99 to below 2% months of imports at end- 1999/00; the strength of domestic demand has continued in the current fiscal year and foreign reserves dropped further, closer to two months of imports at end-August 2000. 5. The pa’anga depreciated by about 25 percent vis-8-vis the U.S. dollar between mid-1997 and mid-2000. However, with some currency depreciation among Tonga’s major trading partners and higher domestic inflation, the pa’anga depreciated by only 6 percent in real effective terms, which is broadly similar to that of other Pacific island currencies. To better reflect Tonga’s trading partners, the currency basket (used for determining the value of the pa’anga) was expanded in July 2000 to include the yen, and the monthly limit on currency fluctuation was raised to 5 percent (from 2 percent). 6. The recession during the mid-1990s has had an adverse effect on the quality of bank loans. While banks have made efforts since 1997 to clean up their loan portfolios, one of the commercial banks is in serious financial distress. Capital injection is unlikely as the majority owner, a foreign company, is itself in financial difficulty. The other two commercial banks are reported to be sound (Box 3). The Tonga Development Bank (TDB) is undergoing restructuring with assistance from the Asian Development Bank, focusing on improving lending practices. It has instituted a credit-risk rating system and a centralized credit approval process, and has introduced an arrears management policy that includes the establishment of a loan recovery division. Total assets declined in 1999 partly due to a write- off of T$5 million. To recoup some of its losses and improve portfolio quality, the TDB prime rate was raised in the second quarter of 1999 from 8.5 percent to 10.5 percent, and it has shifted more toward personal loans for housing instead of loans for development purposes. 4The interest cost of NRBT bills is estimated at T$1.6 million during 1997/98-1999/00 which is broadly similar to the reduction of NRBT’s capital during the same period.

Tonga: Banking System Soundness The banking system in Tonga consists of five institutions: a central bank, three commercial banks, and one development bank. The National Reserve Bank of Tonga’s (NRBT) supervision efforts are aimed at ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Financial Institutions Act and prudential regulations (e.g., on capital adequacy, loan classification and provisioning, and lending limits). Supervision is conducted mainly off-site through the analysis of monthly and quarterly reports, and is complemented by occasional on-site inspections. Total assets of the three commercial banks increased by 29 percent from end- 1995 to end- 1999, with loans accounting for about 55 percent of total assets, while deposits increased by 35 percent over the same four-year period. Capital declined significantly largely due to the distribution of profits by one bank. Beginning in 1999, the NRBT introduced a risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of 15 percent for commercial banks. The two major banks are well capitalized, have sound portfolios, and have been profitable, particularly in the last two years. The smallest bank, however, has lost nearly all its capital, has a large proportion of its loan portfolio in arrears, and has never had a profitable year. During 1995-97, the loan portfolio of commercial banks deteriorated as a result of the slowdown in the economy. Since then, efforts to improve risk assessment and lending practices, together with increased provisioning and write-offs, have helped to improve portfolio quality. In addition, efforts have been made to lower expenses and increase revenues from nonlending activities. The significant improvement in profits in 1998 and 1999 can be attributed to these factors.

Real GDP growth in 2000/01 is projected to slow to about 3 percent as tourism, and hence the services sector, returns to a more normal level of activity (Table 6). Under a restrained monetary and fiscal policy assumption and modest world price increases, inflation in Tonga is expected to moderate. Over the medium term, the GDP growth rate is expected to be 3-4 percent.5 The positive outlook will be realized only if actions are taken to contain demand, in the short run, and to address structural problems, in the medium term. Lack of action on these fronts would leave Tonga exposed to repeated economic difficulties as experienced in 1997/98 and again in 1999/00. 8. Over the medium term, the risk of external vulnerability is expected to be modest if the external current account deficit is contained to about 3 percent of GDP. Tonga’s ratio of short-term external debt to official reserves and debt-service ratio are low, reflecting the concessional nature of its official borrowing (Table 7). These indicators suggest that Tonga’s external position would be manageable in the absence of a strong surge in domestic demand and unexpected bulky one-off transactions that have been observed in the recent past. II. POLICYDISCUSSION A. Policies to Maintain Macroeconomic Stability 9. In view of the recent decline in official reserves, discussions focused on policies that would dampen demand and stabilize official reserves. As noted more fully below, the mission recommended that aggregate demand be contained through a combination of exchange rate adjustment and restrained credit and fiscal policies. Moreover, the mission urged the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to play a greater role, in consultation with the NRBT, in formulating an appropriate macroeconomic policy mix, and in budget formulation to orient the fiscal position and the composition of expenditures toward clearly established economic objectives. Fiscal policy 10. The staff strongly supported adhering more strictly than in the past to the informal fiscal rule during 2000101. Containing current expenditure to the level of ‘The medium-term scenario is presented in Annex I. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- domestic revenue (including revolving fLnds)6 and limiting development spending to grants and foreign financing would ensure no recourse by the government to domestic bank financing; such a policy would be essential, although not sufficient, to contain aggregate demand. Based on a more realistic projection of domestic revenue and grants, adhering to the rule would yield an overall deficit of 1 percent of GDP, about 0.7 percent smaller than the budget. The staff expressed concern, however, that the fiscal rule would be violated unless substantial adjustments were made to the current budget. 11.

Therefore, while some cuts in other nonwage current spending would be possible, other adjustments would be needed to compensate for the overestimation of revenue. Given the limited scope for revenue measures, and the need to speed up rationalization of the tax and tariff system, the bulk of fiscal adjustment would need to come from cuts in the wage bill. 12. The staff urged that the wage bill be reduced to 14% percent of GDP and other current expenditure be kept constant in nominal terms. The 2000/01 budget includes a 20 percent civil service cost of living adjustment, of which the first 10 percent was implemented as of July 1,200O. In order to contain the wage bill to 14% percent of GDP, the staff proposed freezing any further wage and salary increases, including canceling the remaining 10 percent that was expected to be implemented in January 2001. In addition, other current expenditures would need to be kept constant in nominal terms to prevent further crowding out of essential outlays for health and education, operations, and maintenance. At the same time, an additional expenditure equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP per year, in part reflecting a new pension scheme, needed to be absorbed by the budget 6Revolving funds are linked to semi-commercial activities of government institutions or ministries where expenditures are limited to self-generated income from these activities. Any excess revenue is carried forward to the next financial year. Examples of revolving funds include the Post Office, the Forestry Plantation in ‘Eua, the Tonga National Center, and Queen Salote Memorial Hall.

In addition, they would constrain other current expenditures if further adjustments were needed to adhere to the informal fiscal rule. They agreed, however, that grants were overestimated, and stated that capital expenditure would be adjusted according to the availability of foreign loans and grants. 13. Over the medium term, further efforts are needed to reduce the size of the public sector so as to achieve a sustainable fiscal position. In this regard, the staff welcomed the work already done in formulating a comprehensive civil Wage Bill in Selected Countries, 1998 1 I 6. service reform with technical HIn percent of current expenditure HIn percent ofGDP assistance from Australia and New Zealand, which would accompany a reduction in the wage bill, and suggested an early implementation of the plan.

The authorities indicated that they would start the civil service reform once financing from multilateral creditors was assured. 14. As repayments of foreign loans were projected to increase in coming years, capital expenditure would need to be financed increasingly from domestic sources. Repayments of foreign loans are projected to increase on average to about T$5 million a year with no clear commitments for new loans. At the same time, there is little scope for an increase in foreign grants8 To ensure an adequate level of public investment, the staff recommended that capital expenditure should increasingly be financed from domestic sources, which would require some tightening of the current fiscal rule over the medium term. The authorities noted that Tonga, being a developing country, should be a net recipient 7These costs arise from: (i) the interest cost of recapitalization of the NRBT and the TDB (T$4 million); (ii) the interest cost on the additional T$30 million required to meet obligations under the new pension scheme; and (iii) the cost of bank restructuring (up to T$3 million). ‘The fiscal data exclude grants-in-kind, which are estimated at about 7 percent of GDP.

Tonga: Retirement Fund On July 1,1999 a retirement fund (the “fund”) for Tonga’s civil servants was launched. Ihe new fund replaces the previous “pay as you go” system established on April 7, 19 15. The fund’s purpose is to provide benefits in respect of a member’s retirement, death, or total and permanent disablement. A five-member Board has been established to manage the retire- ment fund, comprising three employer representatives (Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, and Attorney-General) and two member representatives, all of whom have alternates. The member representatives are chosen by election. All Board decisions require at least four Favorable votes. Salary and allowances of Board members are covered by appropriations from the Legislative Assembly. The fund’s daily affairs are managed by a Chief Executive Officer. Costs incurred in the administration of the fund are recouped by deducting an administration fee from each member’s account. The Board may invest all or part of the money and other assets of the fund in any manner. Member accounts earn interest at a rate set by the fund’s Board based on the actual net return on the fund’s investments. All benefits are paid in a lump sum. Budgetary implications All members must contribute to the fund 5 percent of their annual salary, deducted from their salary and remitted by the government to the fund.

The employer’s contribution vests after three years’ service. Recent civil service wage increases were provided partly to compensate for the 5 percent employee contribution to the fund. All civil servants holding a pensionable office, aged 50 years or more and with 15 years or more service as of June 30,1999, can elect to remain in the old system; everyone else is required to transfer to the new system. The amount of a civil servant’s entitlements transferred to the new system will be the value calculated by the Ministry of Finance pursuant to formulae provided by an actuary appointed by Cabinet. The total amount of this unfunded liability is estimated at about T$30 million. The interest cost of the unfunded liability is estimated at about T$ 1.8 million. Hence, the total cost of the new pension scheme to the budget in 2000/O 1, including the increase provided to cover the employee’s contribu- tion, is estimated at T$4.8 million, or 6% percent of current expenditure.

However, they indicated that the staffs proposals would be further considered as prospects for new loans over the medium term were uncertain. 15. The authorities’ proposed tax and tariff reform, although still tentative, would streamline or eliminate the bulk of the current exemptions and reduce reliance on trade taxes. Key changes would include rationalizing personal allowances and raising the income tax threshold, unifying the corporate tax rate at 20 percent, abolishing discretionary exemptions while raising the allowable rate of depreciation, gradually reducing the ports and services tax, and simplifying the tariff structure. Exemptions granted for the agricultural sector under the Industrial Development Incentive Act (IDI), which is expected to be repealed in July 2001, have already been eliminated. The staff welcomed progress in these areas, but recommended that more urgency should be given to finalizing the proposed reform as further delay would provide incentives for evasion and depress private sector activities. 16. The staff saw strong benefits in converting the Tonga Trust Fund (TTF) into a foreign reserve fund and establishing clear rules for its use. 9 The TTF, with limited sources of inflows, is slowly being depleted as it is used to finance the budget. In view of the current low level of official reserves, the staff recommended that it would be prudent to maintain the fund in relatively liquid and safe investments; it should be used under clearly established rules only as a temporary supplement to official foreign reserves, and not used to finance the budget, in order to maintain the integrity of the fund over the medium to long term.” Furthermore, any new inflows to the fund from general revenue, e.g., royalty receipts from Tongasat, should be clearly recorded in the budget. However, the authorities noted that the TTF was to be used for public investment purposes only, and that there was no plan in the immediate future to convert it into a foreign reserve fund, although they would continue to review the staffs proposals. Monetary and exchange rate policies 17. Although there is excess liquidity in banks, the NRBT does not have the financial resources to exercise indirect monetary control over the monetary aggregates (Box 5). To enable the NRBT to shift to indirect monetary control, the staff recommended: (i) recapitalizing the NRBT to address the cumulative losses of the central bank; ‘The TTF was created from sales of Tongan passports to foreigners and its assets are held abroad. Royalty payments by Tongasat (from leasing the satellite space) are also understood to be paid into the TTF. The size of the TTF, excluding advances made to the budget, is estimated at US$20-30 million. The TTF is managed by a Board of Trustees which is chaired by the Prime Minister. “‘The staff suggested, for example, that the NRBT could borrow from the TTF to supplement official foreign reserves only if the latter dropped below 1% months of imports under a clearly established repayment schedule.

Tonga: Management of Monetary Policy Monetary policy objectives and targets: The National Reserve Bank of Tonga’s (NRBT) policy objectives maintain: (i) an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves (above three months of imports); and (ii) price stability. It also ties to maintain positive real deposit rates to encourage saving. As an intermediate target, it follows closely private sector credit growth. Monetary policy instruments: A key indirect instrument is the NRBT bill, which is used to influence the liquidity in the market. The NRBT also offers a repurchase facility for short- term liquidity financing, where the rate is based on the minimum lending rate plus a sufficient margin to discourage usage by banks. Direct instruments include the required reserve ratio, which was raised by 300 basis points to 15 percent in September 2000; until it was abolished in early 1999, a 30 percent deposit requirement was imposed on almost all new loans. In July 2000, the use of credit ceilings was officially approved by the Privy Council. - Ineffectiveness of indirect monetary control: When the NRBT was created in 1989, its balance sheet initially consisted of a large net foreign asset position and an almost equivalent amount of NRBT bills. With no financial support from the Ministry of Finance, and the gradual loss of foreign reserves, the income position of the NRBT worsened, forcing it to reduce its bill rates. As a result, the NRBT bill rates have been below equivalent market rates. While a part of the liquidity was absorbed through growth of credit to the private sector, banks still have large excess liquidity. In the face of excess bank liquidity, the NRBT resorted to more direct means of controlling monetary aggregates, including through credit ceilings. Credit tightening translated into an increase in NRBT bills held by banks, in the absence of other invest- ment opportunities, in spite of the lower returns. For example, the reduction in credit in 1998/99 raised banks’ holding of NRBT bills, which was reversed with a loosening of credit conditions in the first half of 1999/00.

These measures would allow the NRBT to use monetary policy as a more effective tool for macroeconomic stabilization. Notwithstanding efforts by both the NRBT and the MOF to establish a closer working relationship, MOF officials did not make a firm commitment to provide such financial support in the near future. 18. The staff proposed imposing bank-by-bank credit ceilings to contain the growth of overall credit given the current limitations on the NRBT’s indirect monetary control. Bank-by-bank credit ceilings were preferred over ceilings on loans to certain sectors as the latter could easily be circumvented. Furthermore, an overall credit ceiling could induce banks to lean toward riskier loans as they compete for a larger share under the overall ceiling. The staff proposal was also formulated to take account of a major loan agreement between a local bank and a private company which, if finalized, would by itself expand private sector credit by 17 percent. The authorities indicated that they would consider the staff’s proposal seriously, as they agreed with the staff that there were no other means of preventing the loan agreement from going ahead. The staff also welcomed the NRBT’s decision to further increase the reserve requirement to 15 percent as of SeIjtember 2000 as a means of imposing credit restraint. 19. The staff agreed with the authorities’ assessment that the pa’anga was over- valued (Box 6).” The external current account deficit in recent years was on average larger than capital inflows (which are not expected to increase in the future). In addition, domestic demand continued to expand in the current fiscal year, which was attributed to a pickup in consumption in the wake of the millennium celebration, further fueled by civil service wage increases at the beginning of the current fiscal year. The authorities recognized that some adjustment of the pa’anga would complement the fiscal and monetary measures proposed by the staff to dampen domestic demand.12 In the medium term, the staff agreed with the authorities’ objectives of maintaining the level of official reserves at 34 months of imports. 20. The staff also welcomed the recent changes in the exchange rate system regarding the expansion of the currency basket and the increase in the monthly limit of exchange rate fluctuations to 5 percent. The system will allow greater flexibility for the “The staff estimated the pa’anga to be overvalued by about 10 percent as of end-1999/00. “The average spot rate has depreciated by about 10 percent from end-June to mid-October 2000.

Tonga: Real Equilibrium Exchange Rate The external current account balance fluctuated widely in recent years, ranging from a deficit of 11 percent of GDP in 1997/98 to a balanced position in 1998/99. The average deficit during 1995/96-1999/00 was 5% percent of GDP. With limited capital inflows, official reserves have declined below 2% months of imports. The pa’anga (USSITS) has depreciated by 2 1 percent since end-June 1995. Nevertheless, with a similar movement in the currencies of Tonga’s trading partners and higher domestic inflation, the pa’anga in real effective terms has remained broadly stable. Estimating potential growth, and hence, the underlying external current account balance, is difficult in an agricultural economy where a large portion of the land is still uncultivated and the manufacturing sector is less Tonga: Effective Exchange Rates, 1995/96-1999100 than 5 percent of GDP. As an alternative to the output gap, the underlying current account (1995/96=100) 110 balance was estimated by the staff as the 105 - average current account balance-to-GDP ratio over the last five years. The rationale loo - for this approach is based on the fact that: 95 _ (i) the real effective exchange rate has v remained broadly stable during this period 90 - REER (where the initial real appreciation in 85 - - NEER 1996197 was reversed during 1997/98- - - - - Average REER 1998/99); and (ii) GDP growth has averaged *’ ’ ,995~ ,996/97 1997i98 199&99 1999m 2.7 percent in real terms, which appears to be broadly appropriate for an agriculture-based economy without apparent changes in technology. Tonga: External Current Account, 1995/96-2000/01 The medium- to long-term saving and investment imbalance (L/T balance) is estimated to be around 3-4 percent of GDP.

A real depreciation of 10 percent would be required to reach the medium-term equilibrium S-I balance. The elasticity of the trade balance (used as a proxy for the external current account balance) as a percent of GDP with respect to the REER is estimated to be 0.2, which is very low in comparison with other Asian countries (i.e., 0.8-l .O). In order to obtain a current account deficit of the order of 34 percent of GDP, the real exchange rate would need to depreciate by about 10 percent.

B. Structural Reform to Foster Private Sector Development 21. Tonga has reached a juncture where it needs to promote further diversification of its economic base. For a small island country that relies heavily on imports, Tonga has limited export capacity and few sources of foreign exchange earnings. Tourist receipts and workers’ remittances have thus far been sufficient to close the large trade gap. However, earnings from both sources have not grown in recent years.14 In the recent past, the sluggish economy, and hence the slow growth in imports, has masked an underlying growing external imbalance, which will be increasingly exposed if economic activity picks up. Therefore, discussions focused on ways to Tonga: Key Foreign Exchange Receipts and Payments, 1989/90-1999/00 (3-YearMovingAverage(US$ mn.)) 80 -Services receipts and private transfers -imports excluding net oficial inflows 20 4 encourage private sector development, including through foreign investment, to promote a shift from a consumption-based economy to a more investment-oriented one. Private sector development 22. The authorities plan to streamline investment procedures by July 2001. Procedures for applications, especially for development licenses with incentives, are ambiguous and subject to discretionary interpretations, creating uncertainties and disincentives for business (Box 7). The staff encouraged the authorities to replace the current requirements for various licenses with a registration system that would be simple, transparent, and fair, and which did not allow much discretion. The staff also noted that regulations on land use needed revision. The current land tenure system requires an investor 13As of end-1999, seven of the 23 Asia-Pacific small island economies had their currency pegged to a weighted basket of currencies; the remaining countries had their currencies pegged to the U.S., the Australian, or the New Zealand dollar. 14The majority of Tongans living abroad work in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. With the general tightening of immigration policies by these countries, workers’ remittances are unlikely to increase significantly in the f%ture.

Tonga: Current Investment Regime Businesses require a business license that is issued on the basis of the applicant’s nationality, a proposed business plan, and financial references. The business license is a de facto regulatory mechanism to control, on a discretionary basis, foreign investment. A set of investment incentives is provided, largely through tax holidays and duty exemptions and concessions. Investment privileges, under the Industrial Development Incentive (IDI) Act, are secured by obtaining a development license.’ The standing committee, which advises on the issuance of such licenses, has wide discretionary powers in issuing licenses and approving incentives. For foreign investment, the committee is required to determine the desirability of the investment based on several factors including export potential, import substitution, level of local equity participation, laborkapital ratio, and technology transfer. The current licensing system fails to provide a clear framework within which investors can make decisions. Moreover, the tax system imposes a high burden in comparison with its regional competitors, e.g., the 42.5 percent corporate tax rate, and the 15 percent withholding tax on distributed dividends which raises the effective tax rate on distributed income to above 50 percent (see table below). The authorities plan to streamline licensing procedures, including through: (i) removing the scope for discretion by the licensing officer; (ii) introducing a clearly defined negative list; (iii) rationalizing the extensive list of conditions associated with granting licenses; and (iv) simplifying the application process, including the removal of the unnecessary information requirements.

As a result, a large portion of land remains unutilized. The authorities acknowledged that land was not used effectively, but they cautioned that changing the regulation on land use would be extremely difficult as it could go against Tonga’s culture. 23. Tonga has limited capital resources and would benefit from foreign investment that would bring capital, technology, and management shills. In this regard, the staff welcomed the recent opening of the fishing industry to foreign investors and proposals to introduce foreign investment legislation with a clearly defined negative list by mid-200 1. In addition, the staff noted that a clear rule was needed on work permits issued to expatriate workers, and that property rights of foreign investors needed to be guaranteed. The authorities stated that problems associated with work permits would be resolved next year when the responsibility on immigration will be transferred from the Police Department to the Foreign Affairs Ministry. They added that the new investment licensing procedure to be introduced next year would ensure a level playing field for foreign investors. 24. Progress in the reform of nonfinancial public enterprises in Tonga has been slow and far behind the pace of other Pacific island countries. The authorities explained that the revolving funds were intended to be privatized, along with certain public utilities. Electricity generation has already been taken over by a private sector company, and inter- national telecommunications services, currently provided by a public sector company, are expected to be taken over by a private company in the next few years. The staff welcomed greater private sector involvement, but noted that some control, especially on their pricing policies, would still be needed to contain the exercise of monopoly power. 25. Tonga’s trade regime is relatively open. There are six tariff rates (0, 15,20,25,35, and 45 percent), with the customs duty on most food items and manufactures at 15 percent or 20 percent. Vehicles are subject to the protective rate of 45 percent. Exceptions apply to cigarettes and liquor, which are subject to a tariff rate of about 530 percent. In addition, a port and service charge of 20 percent is levied on all imports. Only eggs are subject to quantity control and there are no other quantitative restrictions on trade. The staff welcomed the government’s proposed streamlining of the current tariff system, in steps, with the eventual goal of reducing the maximum tariff rate to 20 percent in the medium term. Financial sector issues 26. Progress has been made by the TDB in recovering bad loans, but a clear mandate for its operations needs to be established. Lack of new capital from the government and the pressure to improve loan portfolio quality have pushed the TDB into consumer loans, rather than loans for longer-term investment and subsistence farming in the outer islands. The staff suggested that a clear mandate should be established for the TDB, and necessary funds provided to allow it to carry out its operations. The authorities stated they were evaluating the TDB’s request for new capital injection. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public19- 27. The staff advocated an early resolution of the problem private bank. A resolution plan was needed to ensure that current owners absorbed losses up to the amount of their investment and that their rights and claims as owners were eliminated in a transparent and nondiscriminatory manner. The authorities stated that they had made little progress in finding a market solution and would now consider direct intervention. They indicated that action would soon be taken against the problem bank, but they would need to first ensure that financing for the dissolution of the bank was available, which could amount to T$3 million. 28. The staff welcomed the proposed changes to the Financial Institutions Act that would strengthen prudential regulation. The changes include imposing strict limits on the levels of bank lending to insiders and their affiliated parties, and restricting foreign currency exposure in relation to total capital. In addition, the staff was of the view that all banks, including foreign branches, should publish financial statements so as not to gain unfair advantage over other banks. The authorities noted that the resolution of the problem bank would release NRBT staff to also conduct on-site supervision of other banks. 29. The staff supported the proposal submitted to the Prime Minister to repeal the Offshore Banking Act, which was the reason for Tonga’s inclusion in the OECD list of tax haven countries. Improving the quality and timeliness of data 30. The staff welcomed improvements by the National Statistics Department in national accounts and balance of payments statistics, but noted that much remained to be done. It would be important to resume the compilation of national accounts on the expenditure side, to publish balance of payments data on a more timely basis, and to closely monitor external debt data. Substantial progress has been made in producing fiscal data in a GFS format. The staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to provide key data to the Fund on a regular basis so that surveillance work can continue throughout the year. III. STAFF APPRAISAL 31. After a period of sluggish growth, the economy picked up in 1998/99-1999/00. The growth was led by the services sector arising from a temporary surge in foreign visitors related to the millennium celebration, increased workers’ remittances, and a rebound in agricultural production. A prudent fiscal stance was maintained. 32. However, the external position has worsened substantially, and ofllcial reserves have declined recently to close to two months of imports. This recent development reflects the openness of the economy and limited supply response where an increase in demand is immediately translated into higher imports. A key issue in the short run is to contain aggregate demand. The staff are of the view that monetary and fiscal tightening, together with the recent adjustment of the pa’anga, are needed to dampen domestic demand. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - 33. As the NRBT does not have the resources to shift to indirect monetary control, private sector credit should be contained through bank-by-bank credit ceilings, In particular, the staff are concerned that macroeconomic stability could be adversely affected by a major loan from a domestic bank currently being negotiated, which could put undue pressure on official reserves in the next few months. The credit ceilings should be set at a level that would preserve macroeconomic stability. In addition, a closer policy coordination between the MOF and the NRE3T is needed to formulate an appropriate mix of macroeconomic policies, which should involve providing financial resources to the NRBT to enable it to carry out monetary policy operations. 34. Maintaining the government’s implicit fiscal rule through containing the wage bill will be particularly important in 2000/01. In view of the overly optimistic revenue projection, expenditure cuts would be inevitable to prevent recourse to bank financing, which would be detrimental to the already low level of reserves. The staff urge the authorities to withhold the remaining wage adjustment, which would otherwise add substantially to overall consumption demand, and to maintain other current expenditures at last year’s level in nominal terms. 35. Over the medium term, the structure of the budget needs to be adjusted, with a relatively lower wage bill and higher development expenditure. To this end, a civil service reform plan should be implemented as soon as possible to reduce the size of the civil service and to ensure competitive salaries on the basis of performance. As foreign financing is expected to remain low, a smaller wage bill would be essential for releasing resources to finance development expenditure. 36. The staff welcome the proposed tax and tariff reform which will streamline or eliminate the bulk of exemptions and reduce the reliance on trade taxes. The staff support the elimination of exemptions granted for the agricultural sector under the ID1 Act. Finalizing the proposed tax reform should be given more urgency, as further delays could provide incentives for evasion and depress private sector activities. 37. Private sector development is key to sustainable growth and the expansion of Tonga’s export capacity. The staff support the planned reform in investment licensing procedures and foreign investment legislation by mid-2001. Regulations regarding the use of land should also be revised to make more effective use of valuable, underutilized land. In addition, a clear rule for granting permits to expatriate workers and guaranteeing property rights to foreign investors would be key to attracting more foreign investment. 38. The TTF is a valuable resource that should be converted into a foreign reserve fund to provide an additional cushion for unexpected shocks. Furthermore, clear rules should be established for its use and any new inflows to the fund from general revenue clearly recorded in the budget. In view of the currently low level of official reserves, the staff suggest that the TTF assets be maintained in relatively liquid and safe investments.

Recent efforts to improve the quality of its assets, which have also helped to discourage strategic defaulters, are welcome. Necessary funds should also be provided to carry out its mandate. 40. An early resolution of the problem private bank would help improve financial intermediation and contain the potential restructuring cost. The staff urge the authorities to develop a resolution plan that would ensure that current owners absorb losses up to the amount of their investment, and that their rights and claims as owners are eliminated in a transparent and nondiscriminatory manner. 41. Improvements have been made in data quality, including presenting fiscal data in GFS format. However, it would be important to resume the compilation of national accounts on the expenditure side, to publish balance of payments data on a more timely basis, and to better monitor external debt data. The staff welcome recent commitments made by the authorities to provide key data to the Fund on a regular basis so that surveillance work can continue throughout the year. 42. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Tonga be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The inflation rate is expected to be higher during the first few years due to the passthrough of the exchange rate devaluation and higher oil prices. It is expected to decline, however, to below 3 percent toward the end of the projection period under an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework. On the external front, the current account deficit is expected to be contained to about 3 percent of GDP. With broadly similar capital inflows (reflecting a shift from offtcial to private capital inflows), official reserves are expected to recover to the authorities’ target of three to four months of import of goods and services. Underlying policy assumptions: It is assumed that macroeconomic policy recommendations, as elaborated in the main text, will be implemented. In particular, the exchange rate is assumed to be adjusted by about 10 percent in real terms over a period of one year; credit to the private sector will be contained; and the implicit fiscal rule will be adhered to, including through cancellation of the proposed wage increases. The private sector regulatory environment would improve through the introduction of a transparent and nondiscriminatory investment regime and a streamlined and rationalized tax and tariff system. The tax and tariff reform is expected to start from next fiscal year. Exogenous risks: As a small open economy, Tonga’s external position is vulnerable to: (i) disruptions in private remittances, especially if the U.S. economy slows down; (ii) a decline in tourism from a downturn in economic activities in Australia and New Zealand; (iii) terms-of-trade shocks; and (iv) supply shocks arising from adverse weather on agricultural output. Alternative scenario For illustrative purposes, the alternative scenario assumes that the current macroeconomic policy position will be maintained, i.e., no adjustment of the exchange rate, even though the implicit fiscal rule will be adhered to through further cuts in “other expenditures.” On the structural front, plans for regulatory reform will be delayed indefinitely. Under this scenario, private sector confidence, and hence investment, will remain subdued. The inflation rate will be lower in the absence of the devaluation. The external current account deficit will increase to more than 4 percent of GDP as export capacity remains limited. To finance the larger external current account deficit as well as development expenditure (in the absence of financing from domestic revenue), the public sector will need to borrow more from external sources. Even then, imports will need to be curtailed in order to retain a minimum level of foreign reserves.

An IDA credit of US$2 million, cofinanced by the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), was approved on June 2, 1987 for the Tonga Development Bank (TDB). The credit was designed to provide the TDB with long-term resources to meet investment demand-particularly in agriculture, industry, and tourism-as well as to support institutional development. A second TDB credit of US$3 million was approved on January 4, 1990 and was also cofinanced by the AsDB. The second credit was designed to support interest rate reform as well as to provide financing for projects in the agricultural, industrial, and tourism sectors. A grant of US$250,000 was approved in 1996 to support the government’s efforts in the medium term to improve and expand telecommunication facilities. A country economic report on Tonga was issued in March 1993 as part of the second Pacific Islands Regional Economic Report. This report focused on public sector reform, the role of the private sector in achieving sustainable growth, human resources development, and environmental issues. In addition, country reports on Tonga have been prepared as part of the Bank’s Pacific regional studies on post-secondary education, energy, health, and transportation. A public expenditure review was completed recently. IFC provides small business advisory services to Pacific island member countries through the South Pacific Project Facilities established in 1989.

The Bank has approved 14 loans totaling $47.8 million from ADF to Tonga since it joined the Bank in 1972. The most recent loan, to the power sector, was approved in December 1996 but was cancelled by the Bank in 1998 due to failure to become effective. Of the 14 loans, project completion reports have been prepared for 11 projects, eight of which have been post-evaluated. The current portfolio of projects under implementation consists of three loans in fisheries, agriculture, and transportation sectors. The Fisheries Development Project, approved in 1990, is assisting the Sea Star Fishing Company Ltd. (SSFCL) to improve its management; however, the project yielded very limited developmental impacts mainly due to the poor management of SSFCL. The Transport Infrastructure Project, approved in June 1994, is addressing the government’s policy to enhance infrastructure facilities in the outer islands. The project is in its final stage of implementation, and the overall progress is considered satisfactory. The major road works under the original scope of the project have been essentially completed. Only a small wharf improvement had waste oil disposal facilities remain to be completed. The Outer Islands Agriculture Development Project (approved in December 1995) is proceeding well, but some key issues remain outstanding. The Bank requested a close follow-up of these issues on a monthly basis. Technical assistance grants totaling $10.8 million have been provided for 43 projects since 1972. Five capacity-building technical assistance projects are associated to three above- mentioned loans. Most of the projects are completed or nearing completion. The performance under most projects is considered satisfactory. This assistance is focused on macroeconomic and fiscal management, trade promotion, pricing policy for physical infrastructure as well as institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Agriculture and SSFCL. Planned technical assistance will assist the government to implement economic and public sector reforms, including efforts to streamline and improve the efficiency of the public sector. In the next three years policy dialogue will focus on assisting the implementation of the government-proposed Economic and Public Sector Reform Program (EPSRP). The objective of the proposed EPSRP is to enhance private sector-led economic growth by (a) promoting policies that create a conducive environment for increased investment and employment by the private sector; and (b) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery by the public sector. The Bank would support the formulation and implementation of the EPSRP by providing Project Preparatory Technical Assistance (PPTA), and then a program loan.

The two main sources of statistical information are the Quarterly Bulletin of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT), and the annual Ministry of Finance (MOF) budget documents. The authorities report to the Fund the core indicators associated with national accounts, official balance of payments, and government finance with long lags. In recent years, the Statistics Department/MOF has received regular technical assistance in national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments statistics from PFTAC. In addition, an STA technical assistance mission on government finance statistics was fielded in February 2000. Nonetheless, due to the scarcity of human and financial resources, as well as inadequate coordination among statistical agencies, important data weaknesses remain, particularly in national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments statistics. The national accounts data comprise mainly a gross domestic product (GDP) series, estimated from the production side on the basis of indicators. Only a very rough estimate is available of the breakdown of GDP into expenditure components. The Statistics Department recently published revised estimates of GDP for 1993194 to 1998199 and provisional estimates for 1999/00, with a new base period (1995/96). The rebasing was undertaken with the support of technical assistance experts f?om the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Secretariat for the Pacific Community. The mission assessed the new GDP estimates. During the third quarter of 1995 the CPI was rebased (November 1995 = loo), and an updated basket of goods derived from the 1992/93 Household Income and Expenditure Survey was introduced. A labor force survey and the decennial population census were undertaken in 1996. A regular presentation of government finance statistics following the GFS methodology is lacking. The GFS mission prepared bridge tables linking the government chart of accounts and GFS classification categories, and compiled government finance data in GFS format for 1997198.The MOF used these tables to provide the 2000 Article IV mission with revenues and expenditures data in GFS format for the 1998/99-2000/01 period. The mission recommended that financing and debt data also be compiled in GFS format. The MOF intends to generate monthly fiscal data according to GFS methodology from its new automated accounting system. Published data are available only annually and are not widely disseminated, and revisions are large. The official balance of payments figures are compiled by the Statistics Department with long lags and only on an annual basis; monthly trade figures derived from customs documents are available with a three-month lag. The NRBT compiles unofficial monthly balance of payments statistics based on the foreign exchange records of the banking system with a six-week lag, which is also one of the main sources for official statistics. The figures from both agencies show significant differences. The compiler of the Statistics Department changed recently without a sufficient taking-over period from a skilled predecessor. Obviously the sufficient training is necessary. The MOF has put in place a system which provides detailed information on external debt disbursements and service. Finally, monetary statistics are compiled on a monthly basis for the banking system, and are considered to be of good quality.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Tonga On November 17, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Tonga.’ Background Following a three-year period of weak growth due to poor performance in agricultural production and tourism, real GDP growth in 1998199 and 1999100 is estimated at 3% percent and 5% percent, respectively. In 1998/99, the increased production of processed food and building materials more than compensated for a decline in agricultural output, which was adversely affected by Cyclone Cora in December 1998. Growth in 1999/00 was led by the trade and services sector related to a temporary surge in foreign visitors linked to the millennium celebration, together with the effect of increased workers’ remittances. Growth was also supported by a rebound in agricultural production. Inflation rose to about 4 percent in 1998/99 (period-average), attributed mainly to drought and higher world prices: an upward adjustment in tobacco prices pushed up inflation further to 5% percent in 1999/00. Macroeconomic policies were generally prudent in 1998/99-l 999100. Fiscal deficits were kept low in both years with little recourse to domestic bank financing as the government’s implicit fiscal rule of maintaining a zero recurrent balance was broadly adhered to. Monetary policy was tightened during 1998/99-1999100. However, net domestic assets rose by 30 percent in 1999/0O-due in part to large dividend payments of one bank-which contributed to a ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

The NRBT remains severely constrained in carrying out monetary policy operations. With a large stock of NRBT bills (the key monetary policy instrument) outstanding and no budgetary support, the capital base of the NRBT has been eroded in recent years. Preliminary data for 1999/00 indicate a substantial increase in the external current account deficit. This development reflects growing imports and a few large one-off transactions which were partly offset by the temporary boom in tourism and workers’ remittances. The pa’anga remained broadly unchanged in real effective terms during this period. With declining net foreign capital inflows, international reserves have declined to below 2% months of imports. In particular, the strength in domestic demand continues to exert pressure and international reserves have dropped further to US$l 1.9 million in August 2000. One of three commercial banks in Tonga is in serious financial distress and a new capital injection is unlikely. The other two are reported to be sound. The Tonga Development Bank (TDB) is undergoing restructuring with assistance from the Asian Development Bank, focusing essentially on improving lending practices. The TDB has instituted a credit-risk rating system, a centralized credit approval process, and introduced an arrears management policy that includes the establishment of a loan recovery division. To recoup some of its losses and improve portfolio quality, the TDB has started to focus more on personal loans for housing.
