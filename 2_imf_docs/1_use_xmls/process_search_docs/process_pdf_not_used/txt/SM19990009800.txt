Recent political developments. In July 1998, the King of Bhutan introduced sweeping political changes and devolved most of his power to the Cabinet and the elected National Assembly. The National Assembly was also empowered to move a vote of confidence in the King. 2. Current economic setting. Real GDP has grown by 5-6 percent annually in the last two years. Inflation has been relatively stable in the range of 7-9 percent, closely reflecting price movements in India. In 1997/98, fiscal prudence, together with higher electricity prices and continued donor assistance, led to large fiscal and overall balance of payments surpluses. The fiscal position is expected to be approximately balanced and the external payments position to remain comfortable in 1998/99. 3. Medium-term context. Bhutan’s medium-term economic prospects are favorable, as the country’s electricity generation capacity is expected to triple within 3-4 years. Nevertheless, the economy remains highly dependent on electricity exports and foreign aid. 4. Policy issues. The key economic issues facing Bhutan concern structural policies to broaden the economic base and encourage greater private sector participation. In addition, continued fiscal prudence and the exchange rate peg hold the key to macroeconomic stability. More specifically: . . In the fiscal area, the challenge over the medium term is to diversify the revenue base and to help meet higher expenditures associated with the planned wage increases and the escalating maintenance costs of recent investments in physical and social infrastructure. Although there is limited scope for an independent monetary policy, there is considerable room for improving financial intermediation in support of private sector activity. The private sector would also benefit from a coherent framework for investment, and from a less discretionary trade and exchange regimes. Tn order to create employment opportunities, policies should aim to raise labor productivity and match labor skills with the future requirements of the private sector.

Economic developments and policies in Bhutan are dominated by those of India.’ Most importantly, pegging the ngultrum to the Indian rupee has required a fairly close link between interest rates in the two countries, while the significant and open trade between them has ensured that domestic prices in Bhutan closely reflect the price movements in India. In view of the exchange rate peg and limited scope for an independent monetary policy, fiscal policy plays a central role in maintaining macroeconomic stability. 6. Bhutan’s economy is heavily dependent on development of its natural resources. Over the years, the authorities have aimed to strike a balance between the pace of economic development and the need to preserve the country’s unique cultural heritage and its delicate environment. These strong national concerns and sensitivities have been reflected in particular in the controlled development of tourism and logging-in which Bhutan has considerable potential-as well as in the authorities’ cautious attitude toward foreign investment and expatriate labor. Nevertheless, despite this measured approach to development, Bhutan has achieved significant economic and social gains in recent decades. Large public investment in hydropower and energy-intensive industries -mostly financed by grants and soft loans from India-have broadened the country’s economic base and increased exports. After a surge in the 1980s associated with the launch of hydropower projects, real GDP growth has stabilized at 5-6 percent per annum in more recent years (Chart 1 and Table 1). Major investments in health and education have also greatly improved the country’s social indicators. 7. Fiscal policy has been prudent. The authorities’ cautious approach to fiscal management has been underpinned by efforts to meet current expenditure with domestic revenue, while financing capital expenditure with foreign grants and soft loans. Despite the sizable adjustment of civil service wages (25 percent in 1996 and 20 percent in 1997), the overall budget recorded a surplus estimated at 3.3 percent of GDP in 1997/98 (fiscal year beginning July 1) (Table 2) reflecting in part the doubling of the export price of electricity in ‘The strong economic and financial ties between the two countries are underpinned by bilateral trade and exchange arrangements. The Bhutanese ngultrum has been pegged at par to the Indian rupee which also circulates freely in Bhutan. There are no estimates of the stock of Indian rupees circulating in Bhutan, but is believed to be substantial. Trade between Bhutan and India is virtually free of restrictions. India accounts for over 90 percent of Bhutan’s exports and 70 percent of its imports. Moreover, India provides about one-half of budgetary grants received by Bhutan, and Indians comprise the bulk of expatriate workers in Bhutan. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- April 1997.2 The 1998199 budget is premised on a deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP, as capital expenditure is projected to increase sharply and exceed foreign grants. However, based on partial data and recent trends, capital expenditure is expected to be substantially lower than budgeted and revenues are likely to exceed the budget forecast. The staff therefore estimates the overall fiscal position in 1998/99 to be approximately in balance. 8. The balance of payments position has been strong. The large inflow of foreign ’ grants and rising electricity exports to India have also been reflected in overall balance of payments surpluses of the order of l&l 1 percent of GDP in the last two years (Table 3). The current account deficit with India (excluding grants) has nevertheless widened, reflecting rising imports related to the ongoing power projects and higher service payments’(mostly travel). Imports from other countries have also been increasing due to the improved availability of foreign exchange. Bhutan’s official foreign exchange reserves in convertible currencies amounted to 14 months of total imports at end-1998. Additionally, the reserves of Indian rupees maintained by Bhutan’s banking system were equivalent to 4 month of imports from India. With the full amortization of its only commercial loan (for the national airline) in September 1998, Bhutan’s entire foreign debt is on concessional terms. 9. High rates of monetary expansion reflect the accumulation of foreign assets and suggest increasing monetization of the economy. Monetary expansion has averaged 35 percent per annum in the past two fiscal years, well in excess of the growth of nominal GDP (Table 4). In view of -relatively moderate inflation (7-9 percent in recent years) and large balance of payments surpluses, these high growth rates suggest rapid monetization of the economy; the degree of monetization would be considerably higher if account is taken of the stock of Indian rupees circulating in Bhutan. At the same time, there has been a significant build-up of liquidity with the financial institutions because of the limited investment opportunities in the private sector, partly related to a rigid interest rate structure3. Efficient financial intermediation has been further hampered by high collateral requirements (as much as 200 percent), an inadequate legal framework for loan recovery, and the lack of competition between Bhutan’s two commercial banks. All financial institutions maintain capital well in excess of the required minimum 6 percent capital adequacy ratio; loan classification and the supervisory functions of the RMA are being strengthened. *Capital expenditure also declined sharply in 1997198 due to delays in project formulation and implementation in the first year of the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1997/98-2001/02). The key features of the Plan are discussed in detail in IMF Staff Country Report No. 97/5. The mid-term review of the Plan is expected to be completed by July 1999. Public investment has been generally productive, and close government management of projects and the ongoing decentralization to local levels are increasing transparency and efficiency. ‘The commercial banks’ excess reserves held with the RMA amounted to about one-fourth of their deposit base as of September 1998.

The expected commissioning of two new power projects within the next three years, together with a major project already under way that alone would almost triple the country’s electricity generation capacity, will boost government revenue and exports (Box 1). Over the coming years, the central challenge facing the authorities remains that of improving the living standard of the population through a more rapid and equitable growth, without compromising national concerns about the culture and environment. While the overall growth is expected to be supported by the power sector through direct and indirect linkages, ensuring high rates of sustainable growth requires a greater effort to broaden the production base. As such, the key medium-term policy issues facing Bhutan are structural in nature and relate to encouraging private sector investment; improving financial intermediation; creating employment opportunities; and reducing over time the economy’s strong reliance on foreign aid. The achievement of these objectives-which are consistent with the strategies outlined in the Eighth Plan-is premised on continued macroeconomic stability and donor support. A. Macroeconomic Policies Fiscal policy 11. The authorities reafftrmed their commitment to cautious fiscal management. Close to 90 percent of current expenditure is being met by domestic revenue and the authorities are making determined efforts to increase this share by expanding revenue. In the coming years, expenditure pressures are likely to arise because of escalating recurrent costs of recent investments in physical and social infrastructure. Moreover, building on the recent wage adjustments, the authorities intend to gradually restore civil service wages to their 1988 level in real terms. These two expenditure developments have anchored the staffs illustrative medium-term scenario which indicate that budget deficits could rise to 3-4 percent of GDP by 2002103 (Chart 2 and Table 5). In view of the low public debt, deficits of this magnitude should not pose problems of sustainability, especially if they can be financed by concessional foreign loans or by tapping long-term domestic funds. 12. Nevertheless, the medium-term fiscal outlook harbors some risks, and the staff advised the authorities to press ahead with planned reforms. Specifically, revenue and exports are sensitive to the export price of electricity (negotiated bilaterally with India, usually every two years) (Box 2). Moreover, the magnitude and timing of foreign aid cannot be counted upon with certainty, especially considering Bhutan’s large and growing foreign exchange reserves. The authorities were in broad agreement with the staff’s analysis, and indicated that their objective is to diversify the revenue base and reduce, over time, the budget’s reliance on electricity revenue and foreign aid. 13. Key reforms will be incorporated in the 1999/2000 budget which is under preparation. The authorities indicated that expenditure control would be maintained and plans were on track to introduce a personal income tax in the year 2000.

Bhutan: Hydroelectric Power Projects 1 Chukha Chukha, the largest of existing power projects in Bhutan with a peak capacity of 360 \/IW, was completed in 1988. The project was financed by the Government of India through , :oncessionary loans (40 percent) and grants (60 percent). About 75 percent of electricity generated by Chukha is being exported to India. According to the initial agreement between 3hutan and India, electricity export prices are subject to negotiated revisions once every four fears, but in view of escalating maintenance costs are usually reviewed every two years. Basochu Construction of the Basochu hydroelectric power project started in 1998 and is expected :o be completed in two phases by end-2000 and end-2001. The combined peak capacity of Basochu is rated at 60 MW with a firm power of about 20 MW. Basochu’s generated capacity, ledicated to meeting domestic demand, will be transmitted to 11 districts in the country. The :otal cost of the project, 750 million Austrian schillings, will be met by concessionary loans and grants provided by the Austrian government. , Karichu Construction for the Karichu hydroelectric power project began in 1997 and is expected :o be fully commissioned by the end of 2001. Karichu’s peak capacity is rated at 60 MW with a lirm power of 25 MW. The project is financed by the Government of India on similar terms as Chukha and agreement is already in place for most of Karichu’s generated electricity to be exported to India. . Tata Construction of the Tala hydroelectric power project also financed by India began in 1998 and good progress is being made toward a targeted completion date in late 2004. When fully commissioned, Tala is slated to have a peak capacity of 1,020 MW, almost three times that of Chukha. Details on financing of the Tala project-expected to be on concessionary terms-an not yet available. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- Box 2.

For 1999/2000 and beyond, the staff suggested additional measures such as an environmental tax on diesel; increases in domestic electricity prices; and higher user charges in health and education targeted at the more affluent segments of the urban population. In response, the authorities noted that a review of the domestic price of electricity was under way, and that selective increases in user charges might be necessary for the government to maintain high levels of investment in the social sectors. However, adjustments in diesel prices were considered to be socially sensitive given the already-high cost of transportation due to Bhutan’s rough terrain and widely dispersed population. The staff also urged the authorities to consider, over the longer term, a broad-based general sales tax which could be converted to a value-added tax as the administrative capacity expands and private sector activity develops. Exchange rate policy 14. The currency peg has provided an important nominal anchor for the economy and is consistent with the country’s unique economic structure and trade patterns. Moreover, the scope for a significant diversification of exports in terms of commodities and markets is limited in the short-run, given the nature of electricity exports and the incentives created by India’s highly protected markets. The exchange rate arrangement is also easy to administer, is predictable, entails low transaction costs, and has been an important contributor to private sector confidence. In addition, the inflation rate in India has been fairly low and stable, and the volatility of the Indian rupee vis-a-vis third currencies has been relatively modest. On the other hand, the currency peg has constrained the authorities’ policy flexibility in setting independent targets and using instruments of liquidity management, particularly in the context of the large accumulation of foreign assets. The authorities agreed with the staff that, on balance, under the current circumstances the advantages of the existing currency peg outweigh the increased flexibility offered by alternative exchange rate arrangements. Moreover, the large stock of Indian rupees circulating freely in Bhutan would greatly complicate considerations of alternative arrangements. Monetary policy 15. The key challenges in the financial sector are to address the problem of excess liquidity and improve intermediation to benefit private sector activity. The significant excess liquidity in the banking system has paradoxically coexisted for some time with relatively high real rates of interest and large spreads between the banks’ average cost of funds and their lending rates. The staff recognized the constraints that interest rates in India place on the rates in Bhutan, but noted that the recent financial sector reforms in India have provided greater scope for interest rate liberalization in Bhutan4 The authorities noted that *Reforms would allow the banks’ excess liquidity to be reflected, at least initially, in lower interest rates, particularly on the lending side. There has been no evidence of significant (continued.. .) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- the RMA has been taking steps to increase the flexibility of financial institutions in setting their interest rates.5 But, despite these signals, banks have continued to follow the previous rigid interest rate structure, except for minor downward adjustments in the case of large corporate deposits. The staff recommended the removal of the fixed spread on interest rates which, in any event, is not operationally effective as actual spreads are in fact lower. In addition, the staff noted that interest rate liberalization would need to be supported by a more active role on the part of the RMA to absorb bank liquidity through market instruments, and at the same time increase reliance on indirect instruments of monetary controL6 The authorities noted that efforts along these lines were continuing. They pointed out that the second commercial bank (which began operation in January 1997) would over time promote competition and greater efficiency in the financial sector, thus allowing the private sector to benefit from lower cost of credit. Work was also in progress to strengthen the legal framework for loan recovery in order to improve banks’ willingness to lend. The authorities are also considering the staffs suggestion of issuing long-term development bonds to finance identified capital projects, with the intention of not only diversifying the financing sources of the budget, but also developing benchmarks for the cost of long-term capital in Bhutan. B. Growth, Employment, and Private Sector Development 16. Bhutan’s growth strategy-outlined in the Eighth Plan-is consistent with the country’s comparative advantages and resource endowment. While tapping its substantial hydropower resources and developing associated industries remain the backbone of Bhutan’s development strategy, economic diversification is also being actively promoted. Toward that end, the authorities stressed the role of the private sector within a framework that is consistent with the national priorities. So far, private sector growth has been constrained, inter alia, by the lack of entrepreneurial expertise, shortages of skilled and unskilled labor, the high cost of credit, and the absence of an adequate and transparent administrative and legal framework. Against this background, the authorities’ private sector development strategy has two dimensions: first, to retreat from commercial activities through the ongoing 4(. . .continued) capital movements between the two countries in response to interest rate differentials which have persisted at times, partly due to restrictions on foreign deposits and investments in the two countries. ‘Specifically, effective July 1997, the guaranteed rate of return of 10 percent for the Provident Fund was eliminated. Moreover, in October 1997, the RMA replaced the administered interest rate structure with a fixed maximum spread of 600 basis points between the financial institutions’ average cost of fimds and their average lending rates. ?30 far, the monthly auctions of the 91-day RMA bills and one-off bond issues and reserve repurchase agreements have been the main tools used by the RMA to absorb bank liquidity. The staff suggested ways to make the bill auction more transparent, and to encourage a wider participation of bank and nonbank institutions in the auctions.

The privatization prqgram is progressing steadily. By the end of the Seventh Plan in 1996/97, majority ownership and management in a number of public sector enterprises had been transferred to the private sector. Since then, the privatization program has been proceeding within the framework of the Eighth Plan.’ Currently, full government ownership and control extends to only a few enterprises, most of which are being run on commercial terms. The authorities indicated that the pace of the privatization program is dictated by the private sector’s absorptive capacity. The staff agreed with the authorities that privatization was proceeding as fast as prudently allowed by Bhutan’s limited private capital and managerial resources. Broadening and accelerating the process, however, would require building up the private sector’s absorptive capacity and allowing greater foreign participation. 18. The limited foreign investment in Bhutan has reflected its small domestic market and national concerns about preserving the country’s culture and environment. In recent months, the authorities have begun building a broad-based consensus within the government and with the private sector to establish a framework for direct foreign investment to replace the current case-by-case and discretionary approach. The staff emphasized that foreign investment was significant not only for mobilizing resources, but also to attract technology and management skills, and to facilitate labor training. To foster such investment, the staff urged the authorilies to consider allowing at least 49 percent foreign equity participation in joint ventures, and providing a supportive administrative and legal framework which is transparent and non-discretionary. 19. A growing number of young and educated Bhutanese are entering the labor force, posing new challenges. The authorities indicated that the government would not be in a position to act as an employer of first and last resort, and hence the private sector will need to play a greater role. The staff endorsed the authorities’ approach of placing greater emphasis on vocational and technical training to raise labor productivity and match labor skills with the present and future requirements of the private sector. The staff also welcomed the authorities’ intentions to maintain their liberal approach-subject to national considerations-toward issuing work permits to expatriate labor. Such a policy would ensure the availability of labor at all skill levels and at competitive wages, and would be consistent with the high rates of investment in the economy. 7As outlined in the Eighth Plan, the government intends to divest its interest, wholly or partly, in most remaining public enterprises, with the exception of a few large enterprises (hydropower corporations, the national airline, and financial institutions) which are believed to bc beyond the private sector’s financial and managerial capacity.

Expanding private sector activity also requires a transparent set of rules and regulations governing the trade and payments systems with countries other than India. Bhutan’s imports from third countries require import licences which, the authorities explained, are being issued liberally. Administratively, however, there is a discretionary element in the licensing procedure as there are no formal guidelines. The staff urged the ’ authorities to put in place a system of automatic licensing, within a set of transparent rules and procedures, and subject to a limited “negative list”. 21. Earlier tariff reforms have been partially reversed. In 1996, tariffs on third country imports were lowered significantly and the distortionary aspects of the tariff system were greatly reduced-a move which was supported by the staff.* However, in October 1997, prompted by concerns about transhipments of certain luxury goods to India, the authorities extended the Bhutan Sales Tax (BST) to all third country imports in addition to the existing tariffs.’ The staff suggested that the same objective could be achieved by imposing specific excise taxes on those imports which were being transhipped because of substantially higher tariff rates in India. The authorities were also urged to rationalize the BST and import tariffs with the aim of reducing the number of rates, simplifying their structure, and bringing about a more uniform taxation of imports from all sources. 22. A formal framework for the exchange system has been put in place with the August 1997 approval of the Foreign Exchange Regulations of Bhutan.” The authorities indicated that foreign exchange was now being provided for all bona fide external current account transactions in accordance with the new regulations and subject to limits established by the RMA. The staff welcomed the introduction of these regulations which provide a much-needed formal framework, and encouraged the authorities to move speedily to finalize the procedural aspects and enact the provisions relating to foreign currency accounts which would be another means of fostering the private sector. The authorities were also encouraged to eliminate the remaining restrictions maintained under Article XIV in view of Bhutan’s 8These changes were described in SM/96/288, November 15, 1996. Since then, there have been no further changes in the tariff system. As regards quantitative measures, exports of unfinished timber to India were banned in 1999. ‘The BST (ranging from zero to 30 percent for most goods) is levied on imports from India, and domestically on tourist hotels and restaurant and on cement. The customs duties (with rates in the same range) are applied to imports from other countries. The structure of BST and customs duties is complex and there are discrepancies in rates applied to similar imports from India and third countries. “All the provisions of the Regulations are in effect, except those allowing exporters and other foreign exchange earners to retain 10 percent of their receipts in foreign currency accounts with banks in Bhutan. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-13- large foreign reserves, thus paving the way for achieving current account convertibility at an early date.” The authorities indicated’their intention to continue liberalizing current account transactions as circumstances permit. D. Statistical Issues 23. The deficiencies in Bhutan’s data base which extend virtually across all sectors’ have limited effective economic analysis and policy formulation (Annex I). There has been no significant improvement in statistics since the last consultation. The staff discussed the data issues in some depth with the officials and suggested concrete measures to improve the coverage, consistency and timeliness of data. On the staffs recommendation, the authorities have formed a high-level committee of representatives of all relevant government agencies and the RMA to identify the data problems, establish priorities, and formulate an action plan to address the deficiencies. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 24. The Bhutanese authorities’ balanced approach to economic development and their cautious financial policies have served the country well. Economic growth has remained strong; diversification is adding breadth and depth to the economic structure; and the fiscal and the balance of payments positions have been comfortable in an environment of price stability. Bhutan has also made significant gains in the area of human development reflecting the authorities’ strong emphasis on the social sectors. 25. Bhutan’s medium term economic prospects are also favorable. This optimism is further under-pinned by the authorities’ proven commitment to prudent economic policies and expectations of continued availability of large grants and soft loans to support the country’s development program. Yet, there is no room for complacency, as the economy continues to be heavily reliant on a single commodity and foreign aid, and vulnerable to ail the related uncertainties. These pitfalls are clearly recognized by the authorities as their policies emphasize self-reliance and seek to broaden the productive base. The country’s comfortable foreign exchange cushion provides a solid base to press ahead with structural reforms to meet these challenges. 26. The authorities’ prudent fiscal stance over the years is to be commended. Looking forward, maintaining the recent investments in physical and social infrastructure, and compensating Bhutan’s efficient and dedicated civil service for the past erosion of real income would be expected to give rise to substantially higher levels of expenditures. In order to meet these expenditures-which are justified and indeed desirable-but also equally “The Article XTV restrictions comprise: (i) prescribed limits on travel allowances; (ii) limits on the availability of foreign exchange for imports of services; and (iii) limits on foreign exchange for private transfers. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- important to improve the structure of revenue and for efficiency reasons, consideration should be given to increases in domestic fuel and electricity prices, and in user charges. The planned introduction of the personal income tax is welcome, and the authorities are urged to consider introducing a broad-based general sales tax over the medium term. 27. Significant improvements in financial intermediation are needed to allow the private sector to benefit from lower cost of credit. The increased flexibility recently ’ provided to the financial institutions in setting their interest rates should be supported by further measures to encourage competition and efficiency, and by an adequate legal framework for loan recovery and for expeditious settlement of financial disputes. A more active role on the part of the RMA to improve liquidity management through market-based instruments will also help deepen the financial sector. 28. The authorities clearly recognize the contributions that the private sector will be expected to make in generating income and employment opportunities. The government’s privatization program is on track, but greater efforts are needed to provide a coherent and transparent framework for private sector investment. Foreign investment-which is as important in upgrading technology and training as attracting financial resources-could be encouraged without compromising national priorities. Efforts are also needed to reduce the discretionary and distortionary elements of the trade and tariff regimes. 29. Progress has been made in the past two years to liberalize the foreign exchange regime and provide a formal framework. Yet, further reforms would enable the private sector to benefit from the country’s strong foreign exchange position. In this connection, the authorities are encouraged to eliminate the remaining restrictions maintained under Article XIV, with a view to accepting the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4, at an early date. 30. Improvements in Bhutan’s data base are not keeping pace with the country’s expanding economy and its growing complexities. The shortcomings reflect a combination of technical constraints in data collection agencies, as well as insufficient information flow between different government organizations. The authorities recognize the constraints that insufficient data place on economic management and policy formulation and are determined to deal with the shortcomings. The authorities are urged to move forcefully to identify the priorities, establish an action plan, and seek technical support from donors and multilateral institutions. 31. It is proposed that Bhutan remains on a 24-month consultation cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- I. PROPOSEDDECISION The following draft decision is proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: 1. The Fund takes this decision in concluding the 1999 Article XIV consultation with Bhutan. 2. Bhutan continues to maintain restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, as described in SM/99/98. The Fund encourages Bhutan to administer these restrictions in a liberal manner and to eliminate them as soon as circumstances permit.

The national income accounts and price statistics are particularly deficient. There are also significant inconsistencies between the monetary, fiscal, and the balance of payments statistics. Moreover, the data are subject to frequent, and at times substantial, revisions. The key factors contributing to the data deficience are the lack of adequate coordination among the different government agencies and the shortage of qualified personnel and limitations in computing facilities. The Bhutanese authorities recognize these shortcomings and have formed a high-level committee to establish priorities and address data coordination in the country. 1. Real sector Estimates of GDP at factor cost and final use at current and constant prices are available only with significant lags and are generally unreliable. The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) continues to use various ad-hoc procedures established in 1987-89 to interpolate the missing data, rather than attempting to update the information base (e.g., through direct surveys). Net exports of goods and services and net factor income from abroad are generally inconsistent with the balance of payments data. The consumer price index (CPI) is based on an outdated survey (1979) of consumer expenditures. Apart from the limited coverage of household expenditure (housing costs and many other key expenditures are excluded), the CPT is only compiled on a semi-annual basis. A consumer expenditure survey carried out in 1992 has not yet been used to update the base weights for the CPI primarily due to problems with the estimation of household income collected through the survey. Technical assistance in the area of national accounts and prices was recently provided by the Asian Development Bank. Reliable data on employment and wages are not available, but a recent labor force survey-conducted with IL0 assistance-should improve the availability of labor statistics. 2. Monetary statistics The Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) of Bhutan reports monetary data to STA on a regular monthly basis, but usually with a lag of 6-7 months. The balance sheets of the RMA and the two commercial banks (the Bank of Bhutan and the Bhutan National Bank) are consolidated into a monetary survey. The statistics are based on end-month balance sheets prepared by these institutions and are generally consistent with the Fund’s guidelines for the classification of monetary statistics. There is, nevertheless, room for improvement in a number of areas. Specifically: (i) monetary data prior to 1996 need to be computerized; (ii) more thorough data checks should eliminate mistakes in the computation of broad money that are sometimes reflected in the RMA Bulletin; (iii) in the monetary survey, the earmarked deposit accounts of nonbank financial institutions with the RMAcurrently classified as narrow money-should be reclassified as other liabilities; and (iv) RMA bills need to be recorded consistently at face value in the balance sheets of banks and in the consolidated monetary survey.

Public finance Despite recent improvements in the quality of government finance statistics, the fiscal data are subject to frequent and substantial revisions, particularly in the expenditure area. Revenue data would benefit from a closer coordination between the various departments in the Ministry of Finance. There are also major inconsistencies between the fiscal and monetary data with regard to bank financing-the problem seems to be related to the definition of government between the two sets of accounts. 4. External sector Bhutan’s balance of payments data are deficient. The balance of payments statistics cover a limited range of transactions and many of the key data are estimated. The problem is partly associated with the country’s unique exchange and trade system with India, as well as the large porous border between the two countries which give rise to substantial unrecorded trade in goods and services. No attempt is made to estimate the size of unrecorded trade between India and Bhutan and travel receipts and payments vis-a-vis India are based on tenuous assumptions rather than on entry and exit surveys of tourists. There are also a number of other limitations. Most importantly, trade data are compiled on a calendar year basis while other external transactions are compiled on a fiscal year basis. Consequently, errors and omissions in the balance of payments presentations are large and fluctuate widely. Bhutan does not report balance of payments data for publication in IFS.

While agriculture received the bulk of the assistance in the earlier periods, more recent activity has focused on developing financial institutions and strengthening government capacity. Specific projects have included the development of a local stock exchange and the establishment of the country’s second commercial bank as well as the computerization of the accounts of the Ministry of Finance. . In January 1999, the Asian Development Bank agreed to make an equity investment of US$28 1,000 in the Bhutan National Bank (formerly the Unit Trust of Bhutan). This has been the only equity participation in Bhutan to date. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public
