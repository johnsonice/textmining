They also underlined the need to accelerate structural reforms following the near standstill in 1997, especially with respect to the banking sector and the foreign exchange system. l A weak fiscal policy which required central bank financing in 1997 and 1998 was the principal cause of macroeconomic deterioration. By early 1999, inflation exceeded 150 percent (twelve months) and the kip had lost 90 percent of its value relative to mid- 1997. l Since late 1998, the authorities have attempted periodic stabiiization in line with Fund advice. Most recently, inflation has declined but remains in triple-digits. There are also signs that the two-year depreciation of the kip may be ending, although volatility in the parallel market has increased. l Stabiiization efforts need to be strengthened markedly and made more consistent. The Bank of the Lao P.D.R. (BOL) needs to tighten its credit policy and stand ready to absorb excess liquidity. To avoid central bank financing of the budget, revenues need to be enhanced, especially by using market-based exchange rates for customs import valuation and strengthening the large taxpayer unit. l To restart growth, structural reforms also need to be revived. The immediate priority is to address the insolvency of the banking sector and make the foreign exchange system fully market-based. Reforms of trade and state enterprises are also important. l Strong and sustained stabibition policy and a credible commitment to structural reforms could form a basis for a new three-year PRGF arrangement. The authorities agreed with the staff on the broad direction of reforms, and on the appropriateness of key upfront actions that would demonstrate their commitment to reform, but concrete measures have yet to be finalized. l Data reporting needs to be improved. The policy dialogue is constrained by limited data reporting and a weak statistical base. There also needs to be greater public dissemination of key economic decisions.

Economic Setting The l&o P.D.R embarked upon major reforms in 1989 supported by SAP 1;989-92) and ESAF (1993-97) arrangements.’ Price and trade reforms helped to boost real GDP growth to an average of 7 percent through the mid-1990s while inflation was kept low by conservative monetary and fiscal management. The exchange rate was managed to closely follow parallel market movements. Steps were also taken to put in place other basic ingredients of a market-oriented economy, including an overhaul of the tax system, the introduction of a two-tier banking system, and an external trade regime with relatively low tariffs (a maximum rate of 40 percent) and limited official nontariff barriers. In addition, the authorities privatized many state enterprises and hardened the budget constraints for those remaining in the public sector. 2. Nevertheless, administrative controls and intervention remain pervasive. Despite earlier tax reforms, tax payments are often negotiated with taxpayers on a lump- sum basis, and not linked to economic activities, thus limiting revenue buoyancy. The banking sector is insolvent as a result of poor lending practices and weak supervision by the Bank of the Lao P.D.R. (BOL). The trade system has also suffered from informal and ad hoc restrictions. In addition, highly centralized decision-making has impeded early recognition of problems and their timely resolution. 3. With these weaknesses, the economy continues to be vulnerable to internal and external shocks. The monetized economy remains small and dollarization significant, reflecting limited confidence in the local currency, the k.i~.~ B. Recent Developments 4. Output growth has been depressed for the past two years. GDP growth slowed to 4 percent in 1998 and is expected to remain at the same rate in 1999. This slowdown reflects in part the effects of the Asian crisis, as well as the impact of increased uncertainty about macroeconomic policies. Foreign investment inflows fell from $104 million in 1997 (6 percent of GDP) to about $60 million a year in 1998 and 1999 as hydropower investments were delayed by the economic crisis in Thailand, a major investor in this sector (Box 1). Exports to some regional economies were also affected negatively by the Asian crisis. But with lower FIX-related imports and higher power exports Corn a newly completed plant, the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is estimated to have declined from 16 percent of GDP in 1997 to 11 percent in 1998. Gross official reserves fell from 2.7 months of imports at end-1997 to r The three-year ESAF arrangement, approved on June 4, 1993 for SDR 35.2 million (90 percent of quota), was fblly disbursed. 2 Broad money is about 20 percent of GDP and kip money accounts for under 5 percent of GDP.

The Asian Crisis and the Lao P.D.R. Much of the economic deterioration suffered by the Lao P.D.R during 1997 and 1998 has been a result of domestic policy decisions--in particular central bank financing of the budget and the lack of subsequent policy tightening. The Asian crisis exacerbated the macroeconomic deterioration by (i) accelerating the kip’s depreciation against the dollar as demand for dollars increased both in Thailand and the Lao P.D.R., (ii) lowering exports to Thailand, and (iii) delaying foreign direct investment 1 disbursements. The dominance of subsistence agriculture and the dependence of the capital account on concessional aid limited other adverse impacts. The most important long-term consequence of the Asian crisis for the Lao P .D .R. has not yet been Mly felt. There is a significantly increased risk that ftture demand for hydroelectricity from neighboring countries, especially T’hailand, may not be as large as originally anticipated. Until recently, it appeared that the Lao P.D.R. was set to enjoy huge revenues from hydropower exports, but that benefit is likely to have been reduced and pushed tirther back into the future. This situation requires intensified efforts to focus on structural reforms that can create a business environment conducive to broad-based growth led by the private sector (see Appendix I), while expanding markets for hydropower and other Lao exports. I I 5. Large fiscal deficits financed by the ROL in 1997 and 1998 were the principal source of high inflation and a weakening currency. The budget deficit (excluding grants) widened to 16 percent of GDP in 1997/98 f?om 9-10 percent in the previous three years owing mainly to large irrigation projects aimed at achieving food self sufflciency.3 These investments cumulatively amounted to more than 5 percent of GDP (the size of kip broad money), and were largely financed by the BOL. This infusion of liquidity sharply increased inflationary pressures and lowered demand for the kip in the parallel market. The resulting depreciation quickly fed into finther price increases.in an undermonetized and dollar&d economy. As a result, inflation rose sharply and reached a peak of 167 percent (on a 12-month basis) in March 1999. It has since fallen, but remains at about 120 percent. High inflation in turn eroded confidence in the kip f’brther, and a vicious circle of depreciation and inflation emerged. By June 1999, the kip had lost 90 percent of its value since mid-1997. 6. Faced with a deepening problem, the authorities started to implement stabiliition measures from late 1998. The 1998/99 budget (adopted in October 1998) incorporated major revenue measures (including reforms of the turnover tax and excises, and an increase in the minimum profit tax) with a potential yield of 3 percent of GDP. On 3 The Lao fiscal year runs October-September.

In particular, the BOL doubled the interest rate of its bills to 60 percent in April 1999. 7. However, these measures were not consistently implemented through mid- 1999. Preliminary estimates suggest that fiscal revenues in 1998/99 fell more than 2 percentage points of GDP below the original target of 12.7 percent. The shortfalls were largely due to (i) delays in adjusting the exchange rate used for customs valuation (foregoing revenues over 2 percent of GDP), (ii) failure to implement the new revenue measures incorporated in the budget until the middle of the fiscal year because of a delay in preparing implementing regulations, (iii) inadequate staffing of the large taxpayer unit (LTU) that had been established with FundAJNDP technical assistance, and the limited taxpayer coverage of the unit, and (iv) the impact of higher-than-anticipated inflation in a revenue system with low buoyancy (Box 2). To limit the overall deficit to about 10 percent, and thus eliminate the need for bank financing, the authorities resorted to severe compression of current expenditures. This situation is, however, unsustainable, especially as public sector wages have fallen by more than 50 percent in real terms over the last three years, and governance is becoming a pressing issue. 8. Tight monetary policy was also not sustained, and depreciation and high inflation continued up to mid-1999. To cover revenue shortfalls, BOL financing of the budget was needed late in 1998, while the BOL substantially increased lending to, and deposits in, commercial banks in May and June 1999, primarily to allow extension of agricultural credits. Each lapse in monetary policy touched off a new round of depreciation and inflation with short lags of 1-2 months. In April, sales of BOL bills at a high interest rate succeeded in reversing the kip depreciation and temporarily stabilizing prices, but these sales were suspended within a month because of concerns about the high fiscal cost in a tight budget environment.4 9. In recent months, the authorities have renewed efforts to tighten monetary policy througb strictly limiting BOL credit. As a result, the kip ceased depreciating in July and strengthened slightly in early September, which has helped to reduce price increases. In fact, monthly inflation turned negative in September for the first time since 1995. However, the absence of market confidence that the authorities could sustain a tight policy has been reflected in increased volatility in the parallel market, including a sharp speculative attack in September (Box 3). IO.

Revenue Structure and Declining Revenues Major taxes in the Lao P.D.R. comprise profit and personal income taxes, turnover tax, excises, import and export duties and others such as land tax and property transfer tax. Royalties are also charged on timber and hydropower exports (see chart below). One major Feature of the system is its dependence on foreign trade taxation; the average of the last five rears indicates that import taxes (duties, turnover tax and excises on imports) accounted for a :hird of total revenues, and when combined with royalties and export duties, trade related revenues were a half of the total. Revenue has been declining as a share of nominal GDP over the last two years because of weak tax administration and the following factors that reduce tax buoyancy: Outdated and more appreciated exchange rates were often used for customs valuation purposes to stem inflationary pressure. For example, in FY 1998199, KN 4000 per dollar was used even after the official bank rate increased to above KN 9000 per dollar. The foregone revenue was about 2 ?A percent of GDP. Tax officials often negotiate presumptive lump-sum payments with taxpayers to meet tbe nominal revenue targets. This is in part because most companies do not use standard accounting practices and in part because tax administration capacity is limited. In this system, revenues do not increase automatically when inflation increases the nominal tax base at least in the short run-tax payments must be renegotiated. Provincial revenue offkes have insuffkient incentive to exceed nominal revenue targets. The revenue sharing arrangement between the central government and provinces fails to provide provinces with adequate incentives to strengthen tax efforts. Provincial offices are assigned lump-sum collection targets, and surplus provinces remit 50 percent of the excess revenue to the central government. The rest must be spent on projects approved by the central government, Auwtgt henut Strutturt 1994/95-98199 (Sbarts ofToM Rtwmut) Nontax pIof% tax -Income tax Inport tax (duties, - tnmover, exises on / \ Domestic impo*> Domstic Ibises Turnover tax Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- Box 3. Kip Volatility in September 1999 lhe authorities strengthened efforts to limit credit extension, especially from the BOL, in luly 1999, and the market exchange rate stabiied at around 9700-9800 kip per dollar in luly and August. Because of this stability, people appear to have increased their cash kip holding instead of immediately converting available kip into foreign money. In an economy where kip cash holding per capita is equivalent to only $2 (down from $10 two years ago), a small increase in per capita cash holding would significantly increase the need For kip in the economy. The kip even started to show signs of a dight strengthening in the 6rst ten days of September. ln the next few days, commercial banks often became unable to meet the increased demand for kip notes. Once the shortage of kip notes became known, the public began to hoard kip notes, and the value of the kip shot up to less than 6000 kip/dollar by September 20. That same day, the authorities started to increase the kip notes in circulation and hoarding of kip notes largely ceased; the kip began to depreciate again. By the following Monday, September 27, the rate had fallen back to around 9100 before it began to strengthen again and stahilized at around 8500 kip/dollar.

While the number of SOEs remains relatively small (25 strategic nonbank firms and about 30 nonstrategic firms) following earlier successful privatization, SOEs rely on central bank and priority commercial bank credits (accounting for about 20 percent of domestic credit, a significant share of which is nonperforming). During the first seven months of 1999, credit to SOEs increased by 160 percent (excluding valuation adjustment), three times the rate of growth of private sector credit. Also, many leased state enterprises are not making contracted lease payments in full apparently because of financial distress. The audit reports of three companies controlling significant amounts of logging and timber exports have not been made available to the staff 11. While tariff rates remain moderate, the authorities have resorted to trade bans, quotas and other restrictions to contain exchange rate pressures.6 There remain five tariff rates (5, 10, l&30 and 40 percent) with the simple average estimated to be about 10 percent and the trade-weighted average 15 percent. The average effective tariff has fallen currently to about 7 percent as a highly overvalued exchange rate is used for customs valuation. Responding to pressures on the exchange rate, a recent Prime Minister’s order (06/PM, March 1999) specifies categories of imports: to be restricted (luxury goods); to be guided by the state (e.g., intermediate inputs); and banned (certain locally-produced foods). This order also bans some agricultural exports to prevent domestic price increases. Implementation of these restrictions is largely based on moral suasion, and to simplify administration, the authorities have reduced the number of trading companies from over 300 to about 20. 5 International audits revealed that all seven state-owned banks were insolvent with 25-70 percent of loans non-performing. Similar problems were found at a private bank and a foreign bank branch (SM/98/118). The recent kip depreciation is likely to have made the problem more acute as many non-performing loans are denominated in foreign currencies. 6 Due to the widespread use of nontariff barriers, the Fund’s overall trade restrictiveness index for the Lao P.D.R. is estimated to be 7, among the most restrictive in ASEAN nations.

The Ministry of Finance, however, stressed that the interest cost of these bills would be too high without additional foreign assistance. In addition, the BOL indicated that it would take time to revive reserve money programming and that, in the interim, it preferred to use bank-by-bank credit ceilings, if needed. The staffresponded that more direct instruments should be employed only after other means were exhausted. Exchange rate policy 16. The staff stressed that a flexible exchange rate policy should be maintained and informal rationing eliminated. Given the current conditions of high inflation and volatile expectations, it is difficult to assess with any precision the equilibrium exchange rate. Commercial bank exchange rates should be allowed to adjust in line with movements of the parallel market rates (by limiting spreads to 2 percent), while monetary policy would be used to counter disruptive movements in the parallel market.’ Failure to adjust the offtcial bank rate close to the parallel rate could lead to reserve losses and a substantial shift of transactions to the parallel market. The authorities agreed that these were important intermediate steps toward establishing an interbank market and unifying the exchange rates. Fiscal policy 17. Strong revenue efforts are key to reestablishing and sustaining stability in 1999/2000. To avoid excessive spending cuts and achieve a build-up in government deposits, the stti suggested that the revenue target should be set at about 13 percent of GDP, an increase of 3 percentage points over the 1998/99 projected outturn (Table 3). This target could be achieved by (i) the use of market-related exchange rates in customs valuation for tax purposes (which would yield 2 percent of GDP even after taking account of a possible decline in demand for imports due to higher price~),~ (ii) full implementation of the turnover, excise, and profit tax measures legislated in last year’s budget, and (iii) a strengthening of the LTU through st.afEng it fully and encouraging frequent field audits and intensive collection of arrears. 18. On expenditure management, the staff recommended a decisive re- orientation of spending priorities. After the recent spending compression, there is an urgent need to increase spending on the social sectors and for infiasttucture maintenance, ’ Currently, the BCEL, the largest state-owned commercial bank, sets the commercial bank exchange rate in consultation with the authorities. Other banks adopt the BCEL rate. The bank rate has generally followed the parallel exchange market, but at times of downward pressure, spreads have increased as the bank rate was not adjusted quickly (e.g., January-May 1999). * The impact on prices of using market-based exchange rates for customs valuation is expected to be small as consumer prices already incorporate parallel market exchange rates.

Furthermore, since wages and salaries have fallen sharply in real terms, the 1999/2000 budget should include a modest restoration together with a restructuring of the payscale favoring managerial staff (in line with private sector wage profiles). With capital spending amounting to .about 12 percent of GDP,’ the overall deficit should be targeted at 8 percent of GDP, which could be fully financed by external assistance. The staffalso recommended that budgetary provisions be made for contingencies, as well as for the recurrent cost of recapitalizing SOCBS.‘~ 19. While the authorities agreed with the proposed 1999/2000 budget framework, they considered a revenue target of 13 percent of GDP a challenge. They were concerned that an immediate use of market-related exchange rates for import valuation would be overly inflationary and preferred to phase in its implementation. On this point, the staffresponded that the use of market-related exchange rates was far less inflationary than BOL budgetary financing. The budget proposal the authorities were considering, which was partially disclosed to the staff contained no domestic financing, bank or nonbank. To eliminate domestic financing in the absence of adequate revenues, current expenditures would need to be compressed even further. The staff pointed out that this would be unsustainable, especially in light of the medium-term need to raise social spending. B. Structural Policies 20. Tbe staff pressed the authorities to address the problems of an insolvent banking sector. In close collaboration with World Bank and AsDB representatives, the statfurged the authorities to establish a reform plan for state owned-commercial banks that included improvement in bank management, enhanced debt recovery efforts, a strengthening of BOL supervision, implementation of prudential regulations, and financial restructuring (Box 5). The staff emphasized that the situation required urgent actions and, in particular, stressed the need for early commitment to using foreign expertise in the form of management contracts (or high level advisors) and allowing private equity participation in the future. In addition, a resolution strategy for the two private banks should be developed, which could include restructuring and recapitalization or possible closures. The authorities agreed on the direction of reforms recommended by the staff and intended to formulate a reform plan with technical assistance from the Fund, ’ Public investment of 12 percent of GDP was considered by both the authorities and the stti to be consistent with the government’s implementation capacity. High public investment figures during the last two years reflect in large part the spending on irrigation projects which are now nearly completed and the remaining spending is under increased budgetary scrutiny. lo The annual interest cost of recapitalization is projected to be about % percent of GDP (2000/01) on the assumption that capitalization would take place through a government bond issue.

They still need to gain a consensus on using foreign expertise in managing banks. 21. The current system of informal foreign exchange rationing needs to be replaced by ti fully market-based exchange rate system. This would help restore confidence in the system. The authorities said that they intended to establish an interbank foreign exchange market next year based on recommendations made by two MAE technical assistance missions (1995 and 1998). The staffwelcomed this move, and proposed immediately legalizing the informal foreign exchange bureaus as an interim preparatory measure. I1 22. Fiscal reforms in the next few years should focus on increasing revenue buoyancy. Three issues were discussed. l First, the revenue system based largely on negotiations with tax payers on an ad hoc and presumptive basis made it difficult to raise revenues above pre-specified targets allocated to individual revenue offices. The staff urged the authorities to limit the use of presumptive taxation,” and expand the use of LTU procedures (tax collection based on actual business activities of taxpayers). l Second, the staffurged the authorities to review the revenue sharing arrangement between the central government and provinces. The arrangement should be simplified and linked to actual revenue developments rather than based on collection targets established at the time of budget preparation. l Finally, to prepare for the introduction of the VAT in late 2001, the turnover tax should be reformed immediately by, among other measures, zero rating exports, expanding self assessment, and improving tax credit policy. The authorities agreed with these recommendations; they planned to review the revenue sharing system with the provinces and proceed with the turnover tax reform. They would also consider expanding LTU activities. 23. Trade reform should focus on eliminating nontariff barriers and lowering the maximum tariff rate. The stsff urged the authorities to quickly phase out ad hoc and discretionary trade restrictions such as import/export bans and quotas. In particular, the recently re-introduced import ban on motor vehicles should be removed immediately. More generally, to promote export-based growth, the trade regime should be liberalized I1 At present, the staff does not have evidence to conclude that this system gives rise to an exchange restriction. It will, however, continue to monitor the application of this system in future. l2 The authorities are considering requesting FAD technical assistance for a review of presumptive taxation.

The loss in import duty revenue could be compensated by reducing exemptions and improving tax and customs administration, themselves overdue measures. The authorities agreed that these recommendations were important. In particular, they were considering more price-based alternatives to curb imports of motor vehicles and other luxury goods. On tariff reform, they would give further consideration to the pace of rate reduction, but were concerned by the immediate revenue implications. 24. The staff argued that, privatizatioa and commercialization of state-owned enterprises remained a priority, noting that the authorities had made little progress recently. The staff sought detailed information on SOEs’ financial performance (including that of the three holding companies dealing with logging) ;to assess sector performance and facilitate formulation of a new strategy, but the authorities responded that they were still at an early stage in reviewing SOE financial performance and assessing past privatization efforts, and that they would share the results with the stti only after work was more advanced. 25. Creating a business environment conducive to dynamic private sector development is a key condition for sustaining high growth. The staff stressed that transparent enforcement of existing laws and regulations is essential for attracting more investors, both foreign and domestic. The staff urged the authorities to move forward with their legal agenda by issuing implementing regulations for the Foreign Investment Law and strengthening regulations for debt recovery and security enforcement in connection with the Bankruptcy Law and Secured Transactions Law. The staff also encouraged the authorities to improve land legislation to provide firm property rights for the private sector. C. Medium-Term Prospects 26. If a tight macroeconomic policy and structural reform agenda are rigorously pursued, the outlook for the medium term remains encouraging. By 2002, GDP growth could be restored to 5-6 percent with low inflation, and budget revenues should reach 14 percent of GDP, which would allow critical spending needs to be met and increase the fiscal contribution to national savings. Under such an adjustment scenario, the external current account deficit (excluding offtcial transfers) is projected to be about 9 percent of GDP during the next few years. Gross official reserves could rise to 3.1 months of imports by 2002 (Table 4). l3 The Lao P.D.R. is a member of the AFTA. The authorities have agreed to comply with the Common Effective Preferential Tariff arrangement by 2006, and proposed an initial inclusion list covering about 20 percent of tariff lines.

The risk of becoming over-dependent on hydropower exports to Asian countries needs to be guarded against. The Thai recession has reduced demand for hydropower exports, and power purchase agreements negotiated before the crisis have now lapsed. Given this background, the baseline scenario discussed with the authorities used conservative assumptions, l4 A comparison of this baseline with alternative scenarios in Appendix I highlights the overwhelming importance of vigorous implementation of structural reforms to encourage broad-based growth led by the private sector. Without these reforms, medium term growth could be restricted to about 3 percent largely determined by the rate of growth of subsistence agriculture, and social strains could intensify. 28. External debt sustainability needs to be assessed carefully, using a loan by loan review, to determine the eligibility of the Lao P.D.R for assistance under the proposed enhanced HIPC framework. Debt has so far been contracted on highly concessional terms, but it has risen rapidly relative to GDP given the recent kip depreciation, although debt service remains low. The net present value of external debt is tentatively projected at 54 percent of GDP and 135 percent of exports as of 2000 (Appendix I, Table 7). These figures based on the World Bank’s Debt Reporting System, exclude several state enterprise loans, and may understate the true extent of obligations.” D. Social and Environmental Issues 29. The Lao P.D.R remains a very poor country with low life expectancy, high infant mortality, and a low rate of adult literacy (Appendix VI). These indicators are among the worst in Asia. The government increased allocations to education and health care from about 2.3 percent of GDP in 1991 to 4.3 percent in 1995/96,16 and would like to raise the ratio further to 6 percent in the medium term. The focus would be to provide equitable access to a basic minimum standard of education-especially at primary schools. While low household incomes contribute to low school enrollment, a major constraint appears to be inadequate supply of quality education-including teachers. As regards public health, immediate priorities are to improve the quality of medical services, extend basic health care provisions throughout the country, and control malaria. l4 In particular, World Bank-supported Narn Theun 2 (estimated to cost over $1 billion or two thirds of GDP) would be the only hydropower investment to move forward in the near &ure, and export volume and prices were assumed to be low but not unrealistic. I5 The net present value has been derived by assuming that the obligations to the Russian Federation (SUR789 million) will be restructured in 2000 according to the 1997 Russian agreement with the Paris Club. Under a 1992 agreement with Russia, the Lao P.D.R. has so far serviced 5 percent of the outstanding principal through payments in kind. The Lao and Russian authorities are to begin renegotiations in the near future. l6 According to the Public Expenditure Review of the World Bank (February 1997).

Giien the country’s reliance on natural resources, an immediate priority is to establish sustainable systems of natural resource management for forestry, water, and agricultural land to prevent over-exploitation of these resources. In forestry, the authorities have established a medium-term goal of keeping annual logging below 500,000 cubic meters, which the authorities consider sustainable. But to sustain this level of logging, the regulatory framework must be strengthened and enforced vigorously. The privileges on logging and exports reserved for the three military-owned enterprises should also be reviewed. E. Data and Transparency Issues 31. The staff emphasized that timely and comprehensive data reporting was a prerequisite for effective policy dialogue including starting PRGF discussions. The authorities generally report core macroeconomic data on a timely basis (Appendix V). However, more detailed data essential for effective surveillance and economic program design are considered confidential by the authorities and are reported at best with long lags. These data include budget proposals and reserves and central bank balance sheets with currency composition. The stti also encouraged the authorities to report on the financial condition of banks and state enterprises. Furthermore, the overall data base remains weak and the authorities should continue to improve the statistical base, in particular, as regards the compilation of the balance of payments and expenditure-based GDP estimates. The authorities’ external debt data should also be improved to allow a proper debt sustainability analysis. 32. Y2K preparedness is limited. The authorities only recently established a committee to address the issue. The authorities indicated, however, that the risk of disruption was unlikely to be large given the relatively low levels of computer use and installed technology. Other observers are less sanguine, but agree disruption will be small if public utilities succeed in avoiding loss of service. l-v. STAFF APPRAISAJ., 33. The macroeconomic situation deteriorated significantly in 1998 through mid- 1999. Inflation reached the triple digit range, the kip depreciated sharply, and GDP growth slowed substantially. 34. Weak fiscal management and substantial central bank financing were the principal causes of this macroeconomic deterioration. In particular, BOL financing for public investments cumulatively amounted to nearly 5 percent of GDP, equivalent to the size of broad money in kip. This liquidity infusion touched off rapid depreciation and inflation. The Asian financial crisis exacerbated this by reducing regional demand for Lao exports as well as foreign direct investment inflows. 35. Recognizing that domestic policies needed to be strengthened, the authorities started to take corrective stabilization measures starting in late 1998, but implementation has been inconsistent. Periodic attempts were made to contain BOL credit, absorb excess liquidity, and increase fiscal revenues. However, issuance of high- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2o- interest BOL bills was suspended prematurely because of concerns about the budgetary impact of high interest costs. Targeted revenues were not achieved in 1998199 because of the delayed implementation of budgeted measures and continuing weaknesses in the tax structure. 36. Renewed efforts to tighten monetary policy in recent months need to be sustained. The level of BOL credit has been broadly unchanged since end-June. In the parallel market, the depreciation of the kip has been arrested and some reversal from the overly depreciated level has begun to take place. It will be critical to maintain this tight monetary policy to restore market confidence in policy consistency. In particular, the BOL should continue to strictly limit credit to all sectors of the economy and be prepared to issue stabilization bonds at competitive interest rates should the kip start to depreciate again rapidly. 37. Improved revenue mobilixation is needed to limit demand for bank financing of the budget and allow the increased allocation of resources to priority areas, including social sectors and infrastructure maintenance. Revenues should be enhanced through fully implementing turnover, excise, and minimum proftt tax reforms, using market based exchange rates for customs import valuation, and strengthening and expanding the activities of the LTD. 38. Given high inflation and volatile expectations, the staff recommend that tbe exchange rate should continue to be managed flexibly. Combined with tight macroeconomic policy, this approach would protect international reserves and facilitate relaxation of trade and exchange restrictions. 39. To restore growth, implementation of structural reforms should also be revived. Most urgently needed are actions to address the insolvent banking sector through reforms of bank operations and management, including utilizing foreign expertise in the form of management contracts, and financial restructuring of state-owned commercial banks. The authorities’ commitment to replacing the existing system of foreign exchange rationing by a market-based system such as an interbank market, initially through legalization of the informal foreign exchange bureaus, is welcome. 40. Trade liberalixation and state enterprise reform need urgent attention. Despite earlier implementation of trade reforms, ad hoc and informal import/export bans and quotas have increased, and need to be quickly phased out. State enterprise reform had been considered at an advanced stage, but given signs of financial stress, the sector needs to be reviewed and the privatization efforts reinvigorated. 41. Data reporting and transparency remain subject to severe weakness. The authorities report a number of data essential for a meaningful policy dialogue with long lags, hampering effective surveillance and efforts to design an economic program. The staff urge the authorities to supply all of the data required for continuous surveillance on a timely basis, in particular, BOL balance sheets showing the currency composition of assets and liabilities, and government budget and public enterprise data. In addition, strong efforts should continue to be made to improve the statistical base. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-21- 42.

However, the risk has increased since the last assessment (SlW98/118) that demand for hydropower exports from the Lao P.D.R. may be significantly lower than previously anticipated as a result of the Asian crisis. The key to medium- and long-term prospects is vigorous implementation of structural reforms that create a business environment conducive to broad-based growth led by private investors (Chart 4, Table 6). Key assumptions in the baseline scenario are continued tight macroeconomic policy and early implementation of banking exchange rate and trade reforms. Renewed privatization of state enterprises is also assumed. To be conservative, recovery of regional growth is assumed to be gradual and the large Nam Theun 2 hydropower project is to be undertaken but with a further delay. Its construction is projected to start in 2003, rather than the currently scheduled late 2001, and full exports to start in 2008. Annual export proceeds from the project are, again to be conservative, assumed to be low at around $130-140 million reflecting the reduced demand from Thailand. The benefit fkom increased exports from Nam Theun 2, however, would be significantly reduced by the interest and amortization payments of borrowed finds for the project, and by the annual repatriation of investment earnings by the foreign partner of the consortium. The impact of the project on GDP would also be limited as most capital goods and construction services will be imported-investments would be mirrored in large part by increased current account deficits. other new hydropower projects in the pipeline are not assumed to move forward in the foreseesble future, and growth of non-hydropower foreign investments is also assumed to be modest. An alternative scenario (Scenario I) examines the outlook when reforms are vigorously implemented but the Nam Theun 2 is postponed beyond our projection horizon. In this scenario, the creation of environment conducive to private investments and absence of appreciation of the real exchange rate (caused by large inflows for Nam Theun 2) work to nurture developments of small private export-oriented businesses both domestic and foreign. Growth rates would be lower than in the base scenario initially, but are expected to catch up with the baseline growth. A third scenario (Scenario II) assumes continued slow implementation of structural reforms. In this scenario, the economy would continue to be dependent on public investments and traditional aid financing. Continued administrative controls on a discretionary basis would discourage many potential small investors-and there would be no Nam Theun 2 within the planning horizon. The economy continues to suffer from macro instability. Growth in this case would be much lower than in other two scenarios because of the small size of export oriented investments, and the current account deficit would continue to widen towards an unsustainable level.

The Lao P.D.R. currently holds SUR789 million in loans from the Russian Federation . The base scenario assumes that the Lao P.D.R. undertakes a flow rescheduling with the Paris Club for the duration of a prospective PRGF/ESAF arrangement, beginning in mid 2000. Consequently, Russian claims are valued at 1 SUR= $0.6, and subject to an upfiont discount of 70 percent. Under an agreement concluded with the Russian Federation in 1992, the Lao P.D.R. has so far serviced only 5 percent of the outstanding principal through payments in kind. No payments were made in 1999 and the Lao and Russian authorities plan to begin discussions on this debt my early 2000. ’ These figures are based on the World Bank’s Debt Reporting System (DRS), which does not include information on several loans to state enterprises, so figures in Table 7 may understate the true extent of obligations.

Prior to the introduction of the new economic mechanism, AsDB operations had concentrated on a limited number of areas, notably power generation and transmission, road rehabilitation and forestry development because of the generally unfavorable policy and institutional environment prevailing in the country. With the new economic mechanism, the scope of AsDB activities has broadened. The AsDB currently places the first priority on sustainable economic growth in order to raise the level of national income, and secondary, but important, emphasis on policy reform, social services, and human development to enhance the economic environment and incentive framework. In its strategy and in its dialogue with the Government, the AsDB provides investment and technical assistance to help the Lao P.D.R take advantage of the growing integration of subregional factor markets. The AsDB supports economic growth through infrastructure investments that will have an impact on the domestic economy; in parallel, the AsDB places important emphasis on the policy and institutiona framework necessary to convert aggregate income growth into balanced, shared and sustainable growth. It assists with development of the social services and efforts to address human development needs, and with building the country’s institutional capacity to manage growth and modemization. The AsDB also actively promotes subregional cooperation to enhance market opportunities for the landlocked economy of the Lao P.D.R. Table 1.

A page for the Lao P.D.R. was introduced in the April 1996 issue of International Financial Statistics (IFS). Real sector Until end-1996, the consumer price index (CPI) was compiled using weights that were derived from a household budget survey of 1987. The index covered 73 items classified in five major categories (food, clothing, services, construction materials, and others). Starting in 1997, a new, and more comprehensive CPI has been developed by the National Statistics Center, with technical assistance from Sweden. The index relies on a recent household consumption survey to develop a representative consumer basket. This index covers price developments in Vientiane, as well as other urban areas. The national income accounts are weak. The production-based estimates do not accurately reflect changes in the structure of the country’s production. Fund missions have been encouraging the authorities to address this weakness. No sectoral GDP deflators are available and the CPI acts as a proxy for the overall GDP deflator. No expenditure-based GDP estimates are available. Sweden and the World bank have provided technical assistance on national income accounts including compilation of expenditure-based GDP estimates. Government finance Government finance statistics are very weak. On current expenditure, reliable figures for the size of the public service are not available. A monitoring system for recording new hiring and retrenchment at the central and provincial levels was established in 1995 with the assistance of the World Bank and is a first step towards better management in this area. There is a need to improve the timeliness of data on current expenditure. As for capital expenditure, more detailed information is needed on allocation by sector and by project. In particular, allocations of counterpart funds should be clearly spelled out in terms of the requirements indicated by the donors. In addition, information coverage of military spendiig in the budget should be clarified. On the revenue side, for policy analysis and monitoring, receipts on foreign trade should be compiled with a breakdown by commodity, and by value and quantity traded. In this context, the computer&d database now maintained at the Department of Customs in the Ministry of Finance should be more effectively used. Information on timber royalties should be provided with a breakdown of receipts by major areas of production and type of wood. Data on external, bank and nonbank financing, including treasury bill operations and deposits of enterprises with the Treasury, also need to be improved.

Owing to the lack of reliable data, no government finance data are presented in IFS country page or Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Monetary accounts The authorities have made several improvements in compiling monetary statistics in recent - years. However, the reporting by some banks, especially new branches of foreign banks, is still weak. A new chart of accounts for the Bank of the Lao P.D.R and izommercial banks was introduced in October 1998. A Fund review of the new chart of accounts found them sufEciently detailed to meet internationally accepted standards for the compilation of monetary statistics. The review made suggestions to improvement and clarify the chart of accounts. Even though there has been a substantial improvement in the reporting of monetary statistics, there is a need to improve further the timeliness of monetary data reporting to STA. Balance of payments In January 1997, a balance of payments unit consisting of three staff was established in the BOL. Areas in which the balance of payments statistics need improvement include the frequency and the coverage of (1) customs trade data, (2) the commodity composition of external trade, (3) the recording of factor payments, (4) foreign direct investment flows, (5) the use of commercial bank data on foreign transfers and other transactions, and (6) the reconciliation of fiscal and balance of payments data on external aid (loans and grants). Furthermore, the imports for the planned hydroelectric investment projects should be reported separately; this would help strengthening the inward direct investment data. In addition, the sizable unrecorded border trade, especially imports, will need to be captured. A recent STA mission found that coverage and valuation problems of data on goods arise because of the weakness of customs controls due to staGng and computing constraints. The mission recommended that a valuation unit be established in the Customs Department to assist in validating the value of trade reported in import and export documents. Foreign technical assistance could be considered in helping the authorities to establish this unit. There is an acute need to improve the coordination and cooperation between the agencies involved in BOP compilation, viz., the Customs and Foreign Currency AfGirs Departments of the Ministry of Finance, the FIMC, and the BOL, in order to produce balance of payments updates on a regular basis. Finally, the BOL should develop the capability to prepare short- and medium-term balance of payments projections.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Lao P.D.R. On November 22,1999, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Lao P.D.R.’ Background The Lao P.D.R. embarked upon major reforms in 1989 supported by the IMP. As a result, real GDP growth averaged 7 percent through the mid-1990s and inflation was kept low. Other market-oriented economic reforms, included an overhaul of the tax system, and the introduction of a two-tier banking system and an external trade regime with relatively low tariffs. In addition, the authorities privatized many state enterprises. However, in recent years macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated. GDP growth in 1998 slowed to 4 percent, due to unstable macroeconomic conditions exacerbated by the effects of the Asian crisis. The domestic currency, the kip, depreciated by almost 90 percent against the U.S. dollar since mid-l 997. Inflation rose sharply in 1998 and reached a peak of 167 percent (on a twelve month basis) in March 1999. This resulted from the central bank financing large fiscal deficits in 1997 and 1998. The fiscal deficit (including grants) widened to 10 percent of GDP in 1998. Foreign investment inflows fell from $104 million in 1997 (6 percent of GDP) to about $60 million a year in 1998 and 1999 reflecting delayed hydropower investments as a result of the economic crisis in Thailand. With lower imports, and aided by higher power exports from a newly completed plant, the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is estimated to have declined from 16 percent of GDP in 1997 to 11 percent in 1998. Gross official reserves fell from 2.7 months of imports at end-1997 to 2.1 months at end-1998 and have largely remained constant since. ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

In the second half of the year, more determined tightening was implemented, and as a result the depreciation of the kip was halted and price increases started to slow. However, because of high inflation seen earlier in the year, end-year inflation is projected to decline only to about 100 percent. Broad money is expected to grow by 133 percent this year. GDP growth is projected to remain at 4 percent. In addition, progress on structural reforms has remained slow, and limited to a merger of state-owned commercial banks leaving most of urgently needed banking reforms to future efforts. Because of price and foreign exchange pressures, foreign exchange rationing by commercial banks continues and administrative restrictions have become more pervasive in trade.
