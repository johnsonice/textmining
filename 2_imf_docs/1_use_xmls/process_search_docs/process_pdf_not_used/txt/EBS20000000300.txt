Mr. Amarjargal replaced Mr. Narantsatsralt as Prime Minister on July 30, 1999; most other cabinet ministers, including Finance Minister Ochirsukh, retained their portfolios. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for mid-2000. Background: Economic conditions have stabilized significantly in 1999. Although revenue performance has been somewhat weaker than originally projected, the government intends to cut spending on goods and services and lower priority, domestically financed capital expenditure to keep the overall deficit and domestic financing of the budget within program targets. Macroeconomic developments in 1999 have been in line with program projections for the most part, and the PRGF-supported program is broadly on track. Key policy issues 0 Fiscal policy: The budget for 2000 aims to create room for a 25 percent civil service wage increase through sustainable reductions in other current expenditure and savings fi-om the AsDB-supported public administration reform program. Efforts to moderate the impact of the wage increase on the budget would include early action to garner the savings from administrative reform and completion of a public expenditure review to generate avenues for further expenditure reduction. 0 Regularization of financial claims between the government and the BOM: Operationalizing this process involves a service contract between the MOF and the BOM, the conversion of all existing bank restructuring bonds into treasury bonds with a prespecified maturity and a market-based interest rate, securitization of the BOM’s claims, and an automatic, periodic transfer of interest due by the BOM, as the fiscal agent, fkom the government’s central budget account to the payees’ accounts. In return, a BOM profit transfer is envisaged in the budget for 2000. 0 Structural reforms: Overall progress on structural reforms under the PRGF program has been satisfactory, and actions to deal with three insolvent banks are proceeding ahead of schedule. Two insolvent banks are slated for liquidation, and their licenses have been revoked. For the third bank, the authorities and Fund staff have reached understandings on a restructuring plan. Recognizing the delay in initiating a donor- financed international audit, the timeline for bringing a state-owned bank (TDB) to the point of sale has been reset. Technical preparations to bring two large state-owned enterprises to the point of sale under the program are complete, and the government’s proposals are now scheduled for parliamentary approval.

A three-year PRGF arrangement for Mongolia amounting to SDR 33.4 million (65.4 percent of quota) was approved by the Executive Board on July 30,1997.’ The main objective of the PRGF-supported program was to establish conditions for sustainable growth by fostering the development of a dynamic private sector. Toward this end, major actions were taken to tighten macroeconomic policies, restructure the banking system, reform the tax system, accelerate the pace of privatization, and harden enterprise budget constraints. However, progress stalled in early 1998, as large declines in export prices and spillovers from the regional crises led to a drop in budgetary revenues, a loss of international reserves, and a renewed deterioration in loan portfolios of major commercial banks. To address these imbalances, the authorities announced a package of fiscal measures, but implementation of the measures was delayed by a series of political crises which increasingly impaired confidence in the government. With the fiscal program off-track, only half of the available amount was disbursed, and the first annual ESAF arrangement lapsed at end-July 1998. 2. In concluding the 1998 Article IV consultation in November, Executive Directors supported strongly the authorities’ strategy to promote private sector-led growth by maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, reducing the size of the public sector, eliminating price distortions, and enhancing market flexibility. Directors commended the authorities for achieving a rapid reduction in inflation, but noted that economic performance in 1998 had been adversely affected by steep declines in export prices, political uncertainty, governance problems, and the reemergence of insolvencies in the banking sector. Directors encouraged the authorities to implement policies tbat could be supported by a second annual PRGF arrangement, including early steps toward medium-term fiscal consolidation and implementation of a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the banking system. They suggested that monetary policy should continue to focus on maintaining low inflation. Directors also considered that further market-led depreciation of the exchange rate could facilitate adjustment to the terms of trade shock and help conserve reserves. 3. The Executive Board approved the second annual PRGF arrangement for Mongolia in mid-June 1999 to support the ambitious reform agenda of the Democratic Coalition government. The government’s program aimed to promote a fuller adjustment to the terms of trade shock, lock in the recent strong gains in inflation performance through tight monetary policy, proceed vigorously to strengthen the banking system, accelerate the already successful privatization program, and improve the transparency and efficiency of government operations. On the macroeconomic front, the program for 1999-2001 aimed to achieve real GDP growth of 3-4 percent per year, a reduction in inflation to single digits, and a rebuilding of official reserves to about 15 weeks of imports by the end of the program period (Table 1). ‘Mongolia’s arrangement under the ESAF was approved before the recent amendment of the facility and the change in its name to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- 4. Substantial progress has been made in 1999 in implementing the policies envisaged under the program. All quantitative performance criteria for end-September under the program were met, with significant margins (Table 2). Implementation of the structural reform agenda has proceeded broadly according to schedule (Table 3).* In the attached letter to the Managing Director (Attachment), the government of Mongolia has requested completion of the first review under the second-year annual PRGF arrangement to enable a disbursement from the Fund in an amount equivalent to SDR 5.94 million (11.6 percent of quota). A supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies which updates the authorities’ program is attached to the letter to the Managing Director.3 II. DEVELOPMENTS IN 1999 5. Economic conditions stabilized significantly in 1999 and macroeconomic developments were broadly in line with program projections: 0 Inflation remained moderate despite a large, unanticipated, increase in the price of oil imports. The 12-month inflation rate for 1999 is expected to be around 10 percent, compared with a program target of 9% percent (Figures 1 and 2). ‘The staffis recommending the granting of a waiver for the nonobservance of three end- September structural performance criteria. These related to: (i) the Trade and Development Bank was not brought to the point of sale; a new structural performance criterion is being proposed for March 3 1,200O; (ii) skipping the intermediate step of bringing the bank to the point of sale, a receiver was appointed for the Reconstruction Bank; and (iii) when the attempts to recapitalize the ITI Bank with private capital did not succeed, the intermediate step of bringing the bank to the point of sale was skipped, and a receiver was appointed for the bank. As the program contemplated the appointment of receivers for these banks if they could not be sold, no further measures are proposed for the RB and the IT1 Bank. ‘The original program is described in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (EBS/99/88) and the Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for 1999-2001 (EBD/99/67).

The agricultural, service, and construction sectors continue to be the mainstay of economic growtb4 6. With strong revenue performance in the last quarter combined with some expenditure cuts, the fiscal program for 1999 is broadly on track. Notwithstanding revenue measures adopted in the May 1999 supplementary budget, revenue performance during January-September was somewhat weaker than programmed, reflecting still low export commodity prices, the continued need for strengthened tax administration, a slower- than-expected pace of privatization, and severe liquidity problems at three insolvent banks.’ With the seasonal pick-up in imports during the fourth quarter and steps to improve tax administration, current revenue is projected to meet the program target of 243/4 percent of GDP (Table 4, Figure 3). However, capital revenue and grants are expected to fall short of the program targets (by % percent and ‘/4 percent of GDP, respectively). Building on the tight check on spending during the first three quarters, the government intends to cut spending on goods and services and lower priority, domestically financed capital expenditure, and garner some savings from lower-than-programmed interest payments, to keep the 1999 budget in line with the overall fiscal targets. These measures would contain the overall deficit (including grants) to around 10 percent of GDP and limit domestic financing of the budget to somewhat less than 1 percent of GDP, as programmed. 7. The growth of monetary aggregates was higher-than-programmed and confidence in the banking system remained weak. The higher-than-projected growth in reserve money (and attendant increase in net international reserves) was associated with substantial domestic purchases of gold by the BOM in the second and third quarters of the year. To dampen the potential inflationary impact of rapid growth in reserve money, the BOM increased its placement of central bank bills (CBBs) starting mid-year. In the process, the 12-month growth of reserve money fell from a peak of over 40 percent at end-July to around 30 percent by end-September. Additional placements of CBBs are envisaged during the remainder of the year. During most of 1999, broad money growth was somewhat higher than projected in the program, as net foreign assets of the banking system rose faster than projected while domestic bank credit increased more slowly (Table 5, Figure 4). Within 4Reflecting the sharp temperature changes over the course of the year, economic activity in Mongolia is highly seasonal (Box 1). The large degree of seasonahty has implications for an assessment of economic developments and fiscal and monetary programming. ‘The revenue measures included the introduction of a uniform import duty at a rate of 5 percent and an excise tax on beer.

Seasonality in Economic Variables In Mongolia, very low temperatures during the winter months make it virtually impossible to carry out a number of activities, including mining, harvesting, and construction. As a result, economic production is concentrated in the summer months. The pronounced differences in output which stem from these variations in the level of activity induce recognizable seasonal patterns in prices, production, and monetary and fiscal aggregates. Fig. 1: Quarterly Seuonal Factors I/ PL, 1. M..,.Iy 9 ,,I.. *I m.ctors I, I40 IPJ 12, Broad Money QI Ql Q3 QC Seasonal@ in economic variables in Mongolia is quite pronounced (Figs. 1 and 2): l Quarterly real GDP changes, on average, by almost 50 percent between the first and the second quarter, and by as much as 25 percent between the third and the fourth quarter. Real GDP is significantly lower-than-average in the first quarter and higher-than-average iu the second and third quarters. Mining and construction activity begin only in late March. Livestock births tend to reach a peak in the second quarter. There is also only a short, single harvest in the third/fourth quarter. l Broad money velocity tends to follow the seasonal variations in output, as the demand for real balances changes with the volume of transactions, Within broad money, there are shifts in the currency-to-deposit ratio as working capital needs and labor costs generate a shift to currency during periods of higher activity. Enterprises require loans from the banking system during the second and third quarter, and repay over the fourth quarter. l Prices reach their peak in spring when economic activity accelerates and inventories are depleted; prices are generally low during the second half of the year when economic activity begins to slow and inventories are still high. Measured inflation is also closely linked to the maturation cycle of livestock, and meat production in the economy. The pronounced seasonal@ in the level of activity has implications for economic policy management: l Reflecting in part the lower level of activity, tax revenues are typically lower-than-average in the first quarter. At the same time, heating and fuel expenses are high during the winter months. These factors are reflected in higher financing of the budget from the domestic banking system during the first quarter of the year. The seasonal@ also highlights the need for careful cash flow management by budget entities over the course of the year. l The stance of monetary policy needs to be aligned to the financing needs of the budget and of the private sector. Large seasonal changes in the currency-to-deposits ratio and the multiplier are not uncommon, and reserve money growth can vary significantly during the course of the year. 1/ Seasonalfactors measure the degree of stable seasonality in variables. A factor of x implies that a variable is expected to be x percent of its normal, or seasonally adjusted, value during the period. Seasonal factors average 100 for the year as a whole.

The BOM maintained a flexible exchange rate policy during 1999. The BOM continued its policy of allowing the currency to depreciate in response to the deterioration of Mongolia’s terms of trade in the first quarter. After a seasonal appreciation during the second quarter, the currency depreciated starting in early May, and by end-October the togrog in U.S. dollar terms was around 20 percent more depreciated than its end-1998 level; in real effective terms, the togrog depreciated by 5 percent during the same period, thus facilitating a further adjustment to the adverse terms of trade shock of 1998. 9. In the external sector, a stronger-than-projected increase in net international reserves for 1999 has reflected a somewhat lower current account deficit than in the program. Export volume growth turned positive, largely on account of a large increase in demand for Mongolian raw cashmere from China (Table 6). Exports of cashmere and wool products increased by over 55 percent, offsetting some of the decline in copper and gold exports. Continued declines in import prices for food, manufacturing, and non-fuel commodities moderated the impact on the trade balance of robust import volume growth. Foreign direct investment also appears to have picked up, particularly in the services and trade sectors. 10. Under the PRGF program, the authorities are implementing a comprehensive, time-bound strategy and action plan to strengthen the banking system, eliminate bank insolvencies, and reduce government ownership of banks, while preserving a core banking system and strictly containing the public sector costs of restructuring (Box 2). In particular, actions to resolve the situation of three insolvent banks-Reconstruction Bank (RB), IT1 Bank, and Agriculture Bank (AB)-have proceeded ahead of schedule. The banks were placed under conservatorship during February-May as part of the prior actions for Board consideration of Mongolia’s request for a second annual PRGF arrangement. Under conservatorship, the banks ceased lending activity and stopped accepting new deposit accounts; private shareholders were called on to inject new capital into the banks, and financial audits of the banks by international accounting firms were initiated. With the assistance of donor-financed external advisors, the conservators engaged in an orderly rationalization of the banks’ operations through branch closures, retrenchment of staff, strict expenditure control, asset sales, and loan collections. To maintain public confidence, household deposits at the IT1 Bank and RB were either paid out on demand or transferred to the Savings Bank and the AB, and strong efforts were made to build local awareness of the restructuring process. Loan recoveries and the reduction in noninterest expenditure constituted the main source of funds to pay off depositors and defray the operating costs of conservatorship.

Banking Sector Reform Mongolia has taken significant steps since February 1999 to implement a comprehensive, time-bound banking sector reform strategy. The strategy aims to eliminate bank insolvencies, obtain a substantial reduction in government stake in banks, and strictly contain the public sector costs of restructuring, while preserving a core banking system. Institutional and legal reforms will focus on improved market discipline, bank management, and loan recovery while enhancing BOM’s ability to enforce prudential norms. Insolvent banks: To resolve the insolvency of Investment and Technological Innovation Bank (IT1 Bank), Reconstruction Bank (RB), and Agriculture Bank (AB) these banks were placed under conservatorship. Under conservatorship, the banks ceased lending activity and stopped accepting new deposits. The conservators undertook an aggressive program to rationalize operations and downsize the banks.

The conservator’s efforts notwithstanding, the extent of insolvency in the banks has increased as closer examination and more accurate classification has necessitated an increase in the share of loss loan assets. In addition, further doubts have arisen about the quality of the ‘performing’ portfolio and the cash value of the pledged collateral. The true financial picture of the banks would be available only after a close look at the international audits. Recognizing the need for quick action, the BOM placed all three banks into receivership in October. The ITI Bank and RB are slated for liquidation, and their licenses have been revoked. The AB will be downsized further, restructured along the lines of an agreed plan, and may be recapitalized in the context of a sale to new private owners, Prudential, Supervisory, and Legal Reform: During 1999, the BOM took several important steps to strengthen banking regulation and supervision. A new chart of accounts and a revamped accounting framework were introduced in January with emphasis on public disclosure requirements. Under the new regulations on prudential ratios, a minimum requirement for paid-up capital was set at Tog 1 billion. Enforcement of these requirements led to the withdrawal of licenses of three small banks (the licenses of three other small banks were withdrawn earlier in the year). Regulations governing nonbank financial institutions and operations were brought under the supervisory purview of the BOM. Furthermore, the supervisory capacity at the BOM is being strengthened with the hiring of new staff and training in supervisory skills. Banking-related legal amendments were enacted. These amendments are intended to strengthen the powers of conservators and receivers, provide explicit powers for writing down shareholders capital in insolvent banks, assure enforcement of court orders and speed up the enforcement of collateral, and improve loan recovery. Draft changes have been prepared to provide for a security interest to be created in movable assets, which are expected to be proposed to parliament as a new chapter to the Civil Code during the fall session. A list of bank loan defaulters has been published regularly and cases of staff malpractice are referred to the criminal police.

The policy discussions focussed on the medium-term framework for the program and the macroeconomic policy framework and the structural reform agenda for 2000. The authorities’ medium-term program aims at achieving real GDP growth of 34 percent per year, a further reduction in inflation to low single digits, and a rebuilding of gross official reserves to the equivalent of 15 weeks of imports by the end of the program period.6 To achieve these objectives, the program envisages additional fiscal measures to achieve a reduction in the budget deficit in 2000, significant further consolidation over the medium term, and the maintenance of a tight monetary stance. The impetus for growth is expected to come primarily from greater opportunities for private sector activity through continued implementation of ambitious structural reforms in the banking sector and public administration; privatization of some of the largest, strategically important public enterprises; rapid improvements in public infrastructure; and efficiency gains in the energy sector. The program is based on conservative assumptions about the pace of recovery in the external environment. B. Macroeconomic Policies for 2000 Fiscal policy 12. The government secured in early December parliamentary approval for the 2000 budget broadly consistent with understandings with staff and the overall targets of the PRGF program. The fiscal program targets a decline in the overall government deficit to around 7% percent of GDP in 2000, which is an amount that could be financed entirely from concessional external sources. The program is based on conservative projections of privatization revenues; higher-than-programmed receipts will be allocated equally to a reduction of domestic public debt and to high priority capital spending. The program makes provisions for the full payment of interest on existing government debt and new debt that may be issued in the context of the banking sector reform program, and for the regularization of financial relations between the government and the BOM. In the event the costs of these operations turn out to be higher than projected, the program limit for net domestic bank financing of the budget would be adjusted up to a maximum of Tog 5 billion (around % percent of GDP). 13. For 2000, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase by 2 percent of GDP to about 283/4 percent of GDP. This increase reflects the full-year effect of the 1999 revenue 6The targeted rate of inflation for 2000 (7 percent) incorporates some spillover of oil price increases in 1999.

On the expenditure side, to improve incentives and alleviate governance problems, the budget makes room for a wage increase for civil servants of 25 percent, effective January 1. The authorities emphasized that such a proposal was unavoidable given the political pressures in the run up to the mid-2000 parliamentary elections and concerns over the erosion of government sector real wages over the past several years (Box 3).’ The staff recognized the need for an increase over time in the real wage levels for civil servants fi-om their current low levels and for greater differentiation in wage scales to improve incentive structures, but stressed that changes should be linked to tangible and demonstrable progress in public sector administration reform. In response, the authorities noted their plans to generate budgetary savings through improved procurement procedures, an initiation of output-based performance in selected budget entities (see section below on public sector administration reform), and proposals to privatize selected social services (e.g., vocational training schools and other noncore government services). The budget also makes room for some additional social assistance needs (“A percent of GDP), estimated in the context of an upward revision of the minimum living standard measure for Mongolia; and for higher pension payments associated with a major reform of the social security system.8 15. Considerable attention was devoted during the discussions to the regularization of financial relations between the government and the BOM and full and timely interest payments on public debt. In developing understandings in this area, all involved parties came to the view that a strong effort in this area would enhance policy coordination and management, and help ensure the fmancial health of the banking system. It was also evident that after a down payment had been made to regularize relations with the holders of public debt, all parties-the budget, the BOM, and the commercial banks-could be net beneficiaries financially. Since the discussions, the MOF has operationalized all the elements of the regularization process (Box 4). 7 Despite substantial employment cuts during the last decade, the average real wage for budgetary employees fell sharply in the early 1990s and has stagnated since, reflecting the high rate of inflation through 1997 and inadequate catch-up. 81n June 1999, parliament approved a reform of the pension system involving the introduction of notionally-defined individual pension accounts.

Employment and Wages in the Budgetary Sector As part of the transition to a market-based economy, Mongolia is committed to achieving a reduction in the size of the public sector. Substantial reductions in budgetary employment and in the government’s wage bill took place during 1991-96 (Figure 1). Further reductions were achieved during 1997-99 in the context of the PRGF- supported program to privatize small and medium-sized state owned cntcrprises. After falling sharply in the early 19909, real wages in the budgetary sector have stagnated. Nominal wage increases for budgetary employees failed to keep pace with the high inflation levels during 1991-97. As a result, real wages fell by around 67 percent during this period (Figure 2). The average monthly wage for budgetary employees during 1999 is estimated at Tog 38,000 (eq&alent to bS$38).

To supplement the income from public employment, moonlighting by government employees is pervasive. An increase in civil service wage scales would improve incentives for civil servants and help alleviate governance problems. The government’s reform program is expected to help create much needed room to raise civil service wage scales from their current low levels. After a prolonged delay, the AsDB-supported public administration reforms (Governance Program) have begun. To set the legal basis for these reforms, parliament approved the Public Sector Finance and Management Law (PSFML) in October. Under the program, selected budget entities have completed functional reviews to identify their core operations. Similar functional reviews are scheduled for other budgetary entities during 2000 and beyond These functional reviews are intended to provide a basis for fiuther rationalization of the civil service and identify services that the government could privatize or contract out. In addition, the government is expected to complete in 2000 a public expenditure review, with World Bank support, to identify areas for further expenditure reduction.

Regulariziag Financial Relations between the Government and the Bank of Mongolia A strong effort has been made to improve the financial relations between the government and the central bank to enhance policy coordination and management. A number of unsettled disputes have existed between the government and the BOM, many of which had their origins in the transformation of the state monobank into a two-tier banking system, but have been exacerbated by government debt issues in the context of the last round of banking sector reforms. The BOM’s claims relate to directed loans made by the banking system to public enterprises for which the government provided a guarantee and its holdings of bank restructuring bonds which it acquired from the now insolvent commercial banks as payments for its past credits to these banks. In addition, the BOM has claimed that the government should be responsible for external loans which have domestic counterparts. The government has counterclaims and is unwilling to take responsibility for some claims. In particular, the MOF has argued that the original intention of issuing the bank restructuring bonds was to improve the financial position of the commercial banks. Since the bonds are no longer held by these banks, the budget has been lax in making interest payments on those bonds. In return, the government does not receive any interest on its deposits with the BOM. A resolution of these claims is necessary to form a clear assessment of the government and the BOM’s true financial position. The BOM is under pressure from its external auditors to provision for nonperforming assets, The claims on the government mask the true level of government liabilities. The resolution of these claims has flow implications for the BOM’s income statement and for the budget. The following actions have been taken under the PRGF-supported program to resolve these claims: l An arbitration mechanism for regularization of financial cIaims and arrears between the MOF and the BOM was activated in June 1999; l To strengthen institutional arrangements, the MOF and the BOM have signed a service contract that involves, inter da, the following provisions: (i) the MOF would be required to inform the BOM of its financing needs on a monthly basis and coordinate its financing plans; (ii) the government should keep all its deposits at the BOM; (iii) the MOF would pay bank charges and the BOM would honor government payment orders, in a timely manner or pay a penalty; and (iv) the market rate of interest would be applied to both advances and deposits of the government held in the BOM; l The MOF will convert all existing bank restructuring bonds, including those held by the BOM, into long-term treasury bonds with a prespecified maturity and an interest rate related to the central bank bill rate. The new bonds will be marketable instruments, and will eliminate the need to provision by the holders; l The MOF and the BOM have signed a contract that securitizes a substantial portion of the BOM’s claims on the government. These claims include about Tog 5 billion in domestic currency claims and about US$9 million in foreign currency denominated claims. The contract provides for the budget to reimburse the BOM for these claims on a mutually agreed interest rate and repayment schedule; l To ensure that interest payments on its debt are made on a timely basis, the MOF has signed a contract with the BOM, as the government’s fiscal agent, providing for an automatic transfer of interest due from the government’s central budget account to the payees’ accounts on the last business day of each month; and l Following the regularization of relations, the BOM is expected to make a profit transfer to the 2000 budget of about Tog 3 billion (0.2 percent of GDP); no profit transfer is expected for 1999.

While a decision has been made to liquidate the IT1 Bank and the RB and resolution plans have been drawn up by the receivers, a full quantification of these plans is subject to some uncertainty. In particular, the results of donor-financed international audits of the insolvent banks which were recently completed still need to be lily incorporated into the resolution plans. On the basis of available data, the mission made provisional estimates of the current fiscal costs of banking sector reform, with a view to minimizing the cost to the budget. The program estimates for 2000 are premised on new bond issues to reconstitute claims of the social insurance and pension funds on the insolvent banks; the interest cost on these bonds is estimated at Tog 1% billion, equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP. A similar provision was made for the carrying cost of recapitalization bonds for the AB, in the context of the restructuring plan for the bank formulated in consultation with Fund staff.’ 17. The mission reviewed with the MOF the outlook for further fiscal adjustment over the medium term to support inflation reduction, provide more room for private sector development, and stabilize-and subsequently reduce-the government debt-to-GDP ratio.” In this connection, the authorities are expected to undertake a public expenditure review with World Bank support early in 2000 which would inter alia provide contingency expenditure reduction measures for the budget and to implement aggressively the AsDB-supported public administration reforms which are aimed at improving government financial operations, prioritizing public spending, and improving the delivery of government services. In this context, the authorities noted the significant impact of Fund technical assistance in supporting on-going treasury and accounting reform in the MOF. Monetary and exchange rate policies 18. The BOM agreed that the principal objective of monetary policy should be to maintain a single digit inflation rate, thus cementing one of Mongolia’s most significant policy achievements of the past three years. With the decline in inflation during 1998-99, the ‘The stock operations related to banking sector reform during 1996-99 involved the issue of about Tog 483/4 billion in bank restructuring bonds. The budgetary interest payments associated with these bonds averaged about 1% percent of GDP. To cover 2000 reforms, the program incorporates an additional Tog 18 billion of bank restructuring bonds with a carrying cost of about L/ percent of GDP. These estimates exclude the government and enterprise deposits lost or written down during the liquidation/restructuring of insolvent banks and the BOM (liquidity) loans provided to the banks. “The government debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak in 2001 and decline thereafter (see Appendix). The debt burden associated with this path is substantially lower in net present value terms on account of the highly concessional nature of external debt which constitutes almost 90 percent of Mongolia’s total debt. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-26- yield on central bank bills has been progressively lowered to 17% percent, which has mirrored a reduction in real rates of interest from previously high levels. The authorities and mission agreed that as fiscal policy is tigbtened, banking reforms are implemented, and the near-term inflationary pressures abate, some further reduction in interest rates should be feasible in the latter half of 2000. A monetary program for 2000 was prepared which envisages reserve money growth of about 17 percent, consistent with an end-year inflation target of 7-8 percent, and a net international reserve accumulation of US$12-13 million. The overall monetary program contains strictly net bank credit to government and lending to commercial banks to ensure adequate room for private sector credit growth for the year as a whole. At the same time, the program makes adequate provision for seasonal financing needs to ensure that the budget meets its expenditure obligations and to assist the private sector in achieving the targeted rate of economic growth. 19. The BOM has recently taken a number of steps to improve monetary management, including the introduction of central bank bills of different maturities and measures to enforce compliance with the legal reserve requirements. To enhance transparency of its own operations, the BOM has initiated improvements in its accounting and budgeting systems and strengthened disclosure policies. To facilitate an active and efficient interbank foreign exchange market, the BOM completed a review of the foreign currency clearing and settlement procedures and has taken steps to ensure compliance with the prescribed limits on foreign exchange exposure. The BOM has also taken steps to harmonize its own guidelines on the management, valuation, and accounting of foreign exchange reserves with international standards. In these efforts, the authorities noted the significant Fund technical assistance. 20. The BOM agreed with the mission’s recommendation to continue a flexible exchange rate policy, limiting intervention to the smoothing of excessive short-run fluctuations and a modest further build-up of net international reserves. This policy, together with the monetary aggregate targets, would be aimed to raise foreign reserve coverage to 14% weeks of imports by the end of 2000. C. Structural Policies Banking sector reform 21. During 2000, banking sector reform will be focussed on the resolution of the insolvent banks which were placed under receivership in October. Under the revised Banking Law, the receivers are allowed a three-month period within which to present their recommendation regarding the future course of action-a restructuring of the bank or liquidation-to the BOM. A decision has been taken to liquidate the IT1 Bank and RB, and their licenses were revoked in December. In the case of the AB, the authorities expressed strong reservations about the feasibility of setting up alternative mechanisms for the delivery of government payments currently performed by the AB. The BOM pointed to its Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public27 - unsuccessful efforts to allocate these functions to financial institutions other than the AB; this had not been possible at acceptable budgetary cost. In addition, the MOF indicated that the substantial investment required to set up such a mechanism was not possible under the present fiscal conditions, Nevertheless, the authorities have committed to further exploring alternative options in the context of an overall plan for rural banking and the AB, to be designed in consultation with the World Bank, AsDB, and the IMF. 22. The authorities have developed a revised restructuring plan for the AB in consultation with the staff of the Fund and the World Bank. The authorities’ plan envisages the bank to remain under receivership (essentially BOM management) for a period of 6-9 months during which it would be monitored intensively. During this period, the receiver would implement a restructuring plan to restore the bank to financial viability and solvency. This plan involves, inter alia, further downsizing of bank branches and staff and implementation of a sound business plan. In the event that the bank can be restructured for sale to private owners, the government and the BOM may engage in a recapitahzation of the bank to bring its capital to bare solvency. If the bank continues to be unviable, it could be slated for closure. 23. In light of the revised plan for the bank, the authorities are expected to request at the time of the second review of the arrangement that the end-December structural performance criteria related to the bank-implementation of the recommendations of an external consultant regarding an alternative payments mechanism for government transactions and the need to bring the bank to the point of sale failing recapitalization with private capital-be waived.’ ’ 24. Further steps beyond the program period to strengthen the banking sector, including measures to consolidate banks, restructure the state-owned Savings Bank, and improve commercial banking skills, are expected to be elaborated in an action plan in collaboration with the World Bank and the AsDB in the context of their respective financial sector loan programs. Social sector policies 25. A strong social safety net will be crucial to alleviate the social hardships generated by the transition to a market economy and for the successful privatization of the largest enterprises. The five-year World Bank/ UNDP-supported National Poverty Alleviation Program (NPAP) ends in June 2000.‘* The program aimed to alleviate poverty mainly through microcredits for small business startups. Initially the program was hampered by low disbursement rates, a problem which was finally rectified in 1999. Moreover, “These structural performance criteria relate to the third loan under the arrangement. 12A recent assessment concluded that, despite these efforts under the NPAP, the proportion of the population in absolute poverty has remained broadly unchanged at 36 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-28- insufficient evaluation of participants, combined with the lack of appropriate skills among beneficiaries, contributed to leakages and misuse of the microcredit assistance. To address these shortcomings, a new Sustainable Livelihoods Development Program is envisaged which would first seek to build skills and improve the management and monitoring of credits. The new program would continue to provide direct relief to the poorest households. To complement these efforts, the AsDB-supported health sector reform pilot program will be expanded countrywide in 2000. 26. The authorities welcomed the recent change in the ESAF instrument and endorsed the revised emphasis in the PRGF on poverty alleviation. The authorities noted the recently completed poverty reduction strategy with the AsDB and the World Bank’s review of the government’s existing Poverty Reduction and Alleviation Program. These exercises are expected to provide useful input into the eventual development of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). However, given timing constraints, the development of an interim PRSP in the context of the discussions for the third annul arrangement (to succeed the current arrangement that expires in mid-2000) would be a practical first step. Other structural policies 27. After a prolonged delay, the government has launched a multi-year program of public administration reform. Under the AsDB-supported Governance Program, the Cabinet Secretariat and the MOF have been selected as pilot agencies which would have enhanced discretion over the use of their budget allocations to create incentives for managers to eliminate nonessential purchases (see also Box 3). The managers’ discretion, in turn, would be subject to clear guidelines and accountability procedures. The pilot project will be evaluated early in 2000 in consultation with the AsDB to establish the feasibility of extending this management reform to other government agencies. At the same time, to improve fiscal management, the MOF is taking steps to strengthen the treasury system, including the introduction of an accounting cadre and a single treasury account, along the line recommended by FAD technical assistance. Implementation of these recommendations would enable better planning, monitoring, and control of government expenditures and improve cash and debt management. 28. Privatization is a key element of the strategy to promote private sector-led growth. Over ,t.he past three years, the privatization program has achieved strong results, with sales during 1997-99 averaging the equivalent of around 1 percent of GDP. Under the PRGF- supported program, all government preparations to bring two large enterprises (Gobi Cashmere and the National Oil Import Concern) to the point of sale by end-December were completed. The government has submitted its proposals to parliamentary working groups, and is expected to secure the go-ahead by the 111 parliament at an early date, thus meeting the end-December performance criteria for the program. Considerable progress has also been made in completing the technical work for privatization of the state-owned Trade and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - Development Bank (TDB), including an audit by an international accounting b and the legal due diligence. The end-September target date for bringing the bank to the point of sale (which was a structural performance criterion) was missed, in part due to delays in the initiation of donor financed audits by an international accounting firm and disagreement between the auditors and the authorities on the financial status of the bank. With the resolution of these issues, the timeline for the actions related to the bank has been reset, and all preparatory work required for parliamentary approval to bring the bank to the point of sale is now expected to be completed by end-March 2000. IV. EXTERNALSECTOROUTLOOKANDPOLICIES,ANDCAPACITYTOREPAYTHEFUND 29. Mongolia’s external position is expected to improve gradually over the medium term, as the terms of trade improve modestly and fiscal consolidation takes hold. The trade balance is expected to improve reflecting an acceleration in the growth of exports. Import needs are expected to remain strong to support investment, especially for infrastructure, to maintain the targeted economic growth. Overall, the current account deficit is projected to narrow from 10% percent of GDP in 1999 to about 7% percent of GDP in 200 1 and to 5 !4 percent of GDP by 2005. Additional external multilateral and bilateral assistance will be needed to supplement foreign direct investment and currently identified inflows of official grants and loans to fill the financing gaps in the balance of payments. Financing gaps of US%1 O-l 1 million dollars annually during 2000-2002 are expected to be closed through financial sector program loans from the development banks and other donors’ assistance. Mongolia’s public external debt, including Fund credit and short-term debt, is projected to peak in 2001 at about 90 percent of GDP (60 percent in net present value terms, reflecting the concessional nature of the debt) and decline there&r. Medium- and long-term loan disbursements are projected to average about US$lOO million per year over the medium term.13 30. Mongolia is committed to maintain its liberal trade regime and prudent external debt policies.14 The authorities are also aware of the need to maintain regular relations with creditors. The staff encouraged the authorities to continue their good faith efforts to reach agreement on payments due to ensure that the program remains fully financed. For 2000, debt service payments are estimated at US$30 million, Payments on post-1991 debt to Russia for 2000 are expected to be agreed at the next high-level inter-governmental committee meeting (IGCM) in March 2000; provisional estimates for the year are included in the program 13The debt stock estimates exclude Russia’s large, unresolved pm-1991 transferable rouble claims on Mongolia. Given the disputed nature of these obligations, the corresponding claims by Russia do not constitute arrears for program purposes, and no payments are assumed in the projections during the program period. 14For a description of Mongolia’s trade regime, see Statistical Annex.

Mongolia’s debt service payments, including on Fund credit and short-term debt, are projected to remain at 5-6 percent of gross current receipts. Repayments to the Fund will amount to 1 percent of gross current receipts in 2000-2002, equivalent to 3 percent of projected gross official reserves (Table 7). On the basis of this scenario and Mongolia’s good record in making payments to the Fund, the authorities are expected to discharge their obligations to the Fund on a timely basis. V. PROGRAM MONITORING 31. The mission reviewed the indicative targets for end-December and performance criteria for end-March 2000. In light of the monetary and fiscal program for 2000 elaborated with the mission, the quantitative performance criteria for end-March 2000 have been revised. The revised understandings under the program, including the proposed structural performance criteria and benchmarks, are reflected in the supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (Attachment). VI. TECHNICAL ASXSTANCE CONSULTATIONS 32. In the context of the policy discussions, the staff reviewed with the authorities recent technical assistance delivery from the Fund as part of a pilot project for technical assistance consultations. Prior to the mission, an assessment of recent technical assistance activity on the part of the main technical assistance departments in the Fund was shared with the authorities for their review and comment (Annex II). The authorities expressed broad agreement with the assessment by the staff and indicated that they were highly appreciative of the Fund’s recent technical assistance efforts in the fiscal, monetary and statistical fields which had served to reinforce the Government’s economic reform agenda. For the period ahead, the authorities attached particular priority to the following requirements: in the fiscal area, assistance is needed for a further strengthening of tax administration through the establishment of a large taxpayer unit and the automation of VAT collection procedures; in the monetary field, the authorities highlighted the need for further strengthening of bank supervision and the regulatory framework and for assistance in the development of a market for government securities; in statistics, the authorities are keen to revise the consumer price index and complete the work on developing quarterly national account statistics. The Mongolian authorities have expressed an interest in participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GADS) and have designated a national coordinator.

Mongolia has made significant strides to a market-based economy over a decade of transition. Economic reforms were accelerated and financial policies tightened during 1996-97 under the program supported by the first annual PRGF arrangement to significantly advance the gains of the early years. By end- 1997, macroeconomic conditions had stabilized: inflation had been contained, growth had picked up, and official reserves were at a comfortable level. The setbacks that occurred in 1998-reflecting large declines in export prices, spillovers from the regional crises, and domestic political problems-demonstrated the continued vulnerability of the economy as the terms of trade shock increased the fiscal deficit and exacerbated the already difficult situation of some commercial banks. Nevertheless, growth remained surprisingly resilient and inflation continued to decline. In 1999, the successive governments of the ruling Democratic Coalition recognized the urgent need to rebuild public confidence and reengaged themselves to the reform process. The government’s ambitious program aimed to complete the adjustment to the large external shock, extend progress in macroeconomic stabilization, and reinvigorate the structural reform process. 34. Mongolia’s performance under the second annual PRGF arrangement has been strong. All quantitative performance criteria under the program have been observed; implementation of the structural reform agenda has proceeded broadly according to schedule, while some actions to resolve the financial situation of three insolvent banks have been taken ahead of schedule. The reform agenda was expanded during the first review to include a comprehensive regularization of financial relations between the government and the BOM, which has been a long-standing unresolved issue. All prior actions for the completion of the first review have been implemented, including the passage of a budget for 2000, revocation of licenses of two insolvent banks, and a plan formulated in consultation with Fund staff for a restructuring of the third bank. All technical work to bring two large state-owned enterprises to the point of sale has been completed. Appropriate understandings have also been reached with regard to the privatization of the Trade and Development Bank. 35. Continued fMca1 consolidation under the program will be needed to contain inflationary pressures, avoid a crowding out of the private sector, and promote medium-term sustainability. The budget for 2000 has been fiarned in a realistic manner taking account of prospective improvements in export commodity prices and builds on the strong revenue measures undertaken during 1998-99 with further efforts to improve tax administration. The staff has discussed at length with the authorities the risks associated with the large wage increase and stressed vigorous implementation of a credible program of public administration reform, expenditure saving, and improved public expenditure management to moderate the effect of the salary hike. Over the medium term, fiscal adjustment will come from expenditure reduction for which the public expenditure review that is planned with the World Bank during the early part of 2000 would set the stage. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33 - 36. The regularization of financial relations between the government and the @OM and of public debt service payments more generally will bring significant benefits. Besides improving the financial position of the BOM and the Finance Ministry, these measures will enhance policy coordination, strengthen the autonomy of the BOM, and establish the full integrity of public debt instruments. However, achievement of these gains will require that the institutional procedures in the Ministry of Finance be strengthened to ensure that consistent, workable rules reduce the current, large role of discretion in budget implementation. 37. In the period ahead, the challenge for monetary policy is to maintain the impressive performance on inflation while fostering confidence in the banking system. In the near term, the spillover effects of the recent oil price increases and the supply shortages are likely to maintain upward pressure on prices. The BOM will need to make continued efforts to ensure a low inflation environment by maintaining interest rates that are positive in real terms. The monetary program for 2000 has been framed with a view to fLrther gradual reduction in the central bank bill rate in the second half of the year, once the seasonal effect of the fiscal impulse and the inflationary pressures early in the year have ebbed. In this context, monetary management would benefit from further development of indirect instruments, an improved interbank money market, and a stronger banking system. 38. The exchange rate has now stabilized without central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market, and the adjustment to the sharp deterioration in the terms of trade appears to have been absorbed. Nevertheless, given Mongolia’s strong outward orientation, the authorities will need to remain vigilant with regard to the economy’s external competitiveness. In any case, the BOM should continue to allow the exchange rate to reflect market conditions and to limit intervention to smoothing excessive short-term fluctuations while accommodating some further build-up in net international reserves. 39. Implementation of the authorities’ comprehensive approach to banking sector reform, which was given a strong footing in the current PRGF program, has proceeded well, but efforts are still needed to achieve the reform objectives. Improvements in the financial condition of the banks, including through effective supervision, will enhance resource mobilization and allocation, reduce intermediation costs, conserve budgetary resources, and provide efficient banking services to the public. The BOM has taken strong action to resolve the situation of the RB and IT1 Bank through liquidation, and a restructuring plan has been developed for the Agricultural Bank which calls for a substantial downsizing of its operations. Continued, orderly liquidation of the two banks and efforts to restructure the third will undoubtedly place a severe strain on the already stretched capacity of the BOM. The strong policy coordination among the implementing agencies, and of these agencies with donors, which has been a keystone of the process thus far, will continue to be critical for the success of the reform effort.

The efficiency gains from public administration reform and privatization will enhance Mongolia’s long-term growth prospects. Public administration reform will help create the much needed room to improve incentives for civil servants by creating avenues for wage decompression and clarifying responsibilities and reward structures. At the same time, it would improve the quality of government services at reduced budgetary costs, increase transparency, and restore public confidence. With the extension of the privatization program to the so-called most valued companies, Mongolia has entered a final and welcome phase of state divestment. 41. The government’s emphasis on building worker skills under its revised strategy for poverty alleviation, supplemented by well-targeted assistance for the vulnerable sections of society, is appropriate. The strategy seeks to maintain incentives for work, and the added attention to management and monitoring of assistance would help reduce leakages Corn the social assistance system. At the same time, a more effkient use of education and health spending and reform of the pension system will likely improve the provision of social services. 42. The authorities’ resolve to persevere and careful preparations notwithstanding, considerable risks remain. Uncertainties related to the electoral cycle are obvious. These uncertainties will likely impact all aspects of the program in the run-up to the elections, and thereafter. Specifically, fiscal measures may be required in the event of slippages in the revenue targets and contingency measures identified as part of the planned public expenditure review may need to be activated. Strong efforts will also be required to stay the course in winding down the insolvent banks slated for liquidation, to resist liquidity pressures that are likely to emerge, and to safeguard the stability of the financial system. Also, timely approval by parliament of the privatization plans for the large enterprises will be critical to sustaining the reform momentum. 43. Mongolia’s commitment to the adjustment program is worthy of strong, continued, donor financial support and technical assistance, despite potential risks. Timely and adequate concessional financing from international financial institutions is needed to ensure successful program implementation. The staff supports the Mongolian authorities’ requests for completion of the first review, for waiver for nonobservance of performance criteria, and for modification of the second annual PRGF arrangement. 44. It is recommended that Mongolia remain on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-35- Table 8.

External and domestic debt accounted for approximately 90 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of total debt. External debt (excluding Russia’s large, unresolved pre- 199 1 transferable rouble claims on Mongolia) comprised mainly concession multilateral and bilateral loans. A substantial portion of domestic debt (75 percent) was accounted for by bank restructuring bonds issued during 1996-97. Mongolia’s government debt would be sustainable if continued fiscal consolidation, based on further expenditure reductions (including from comprehensive public administration reforms), can be undertaken over the medium term (see Table). Given the need for a step-up in public sector investment and the continued availability of concessional financing, the government debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to further increase in the near term, peaking at around 80 percent of GDP in 200 1. Thereafter, the government debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline and eventually stabilize around 50 percent by 20 IO, as foreign borrowing as a percentage of GDP is likely to decline substantially in response to fiscal consolidation. This baseline scenario assumes a decline in the interest rate on domestic debt (from 16% percent in 2000 to 11 l/4 percent in 20 10) reflecting further reduction in inflation and progress in banking sector reform; the interest rate remains positive in real terms. The government debt stock projections also assume new bonds issues of Tog 18 billion in 2000 to: (i) reconstitute the claims of the social security and pension funds on two insolvent banks, and (ii) potentially recapitalize a third bank. The projections of government debt are closely related to the fiscal costs of banking sector reform and the new issues of bonds in 2000. The regularization of financial relations between the BOM and the government may also require additional bond issues. In this event of higher-than-programmed bond issues, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase more rapidly than in the baseline scenario, and its stabilization would be come later. Interest costs would also be larger. However, these contingencies are not expected to affect the evolution of the debt profile significantly.

Technical Assistance Provided t-j* J During the last two years, FAD has provided significant technical assistance (TA): I m une 1997, an FAD expert assisted in drafting the value added tax (VAT) law and administrative regulations; (ii) in September 1997, an FAD mission prepared a detailed VAT implementation plan; (iii) in March 1998, FAD assigned an advisor to assist with the introduction of the VAT and to oversee four short-term experts; and (iv) in April 1999 to improve the design and administration of the VAT, focusing on implementation of a large taxpayer unit, improved controls over exemptions granted to aid-funded projects, and strengthening collection of VAT arrears. A World Bank Fiscal Technical Assistance Project (FTAP) provides support for implementation of the VAT and the treasury system (see below). 2. FAD has provided technical assistance in public expenditure management through missions in 1997 and 1998. The authorities are introducing a broad range of public sector reforms that emphasize decentralized fiscal management, but have requested Fund assistance to develop a strong central treasury fLnction to ensure adequate overall control. A treasury advisor was appointed recently to help design and implement the central treasury system, and an FAD mission in July 1999 helped consolidate a plan for implementing a treasury system and develop draft specifications for establishing a computerized treasury financial management information system. The mission also assisted in the preparation of a draft agreement between the MOF and the BOM regarding banking and payments arrangements to facilitate the implementation of the treasury system. 3. An FAD mission assessed social safety net and pension issues in October 1997. To improve the linkage between benefits and contributions and to alleviate some of the demographic risks and the problem of a declining contribution base in the present pay-as-you- go system, Parliament approved in June 1999 the introduction of individual pension accounts from 2001 and the adoption of partial fimding from 2005. 4. The authorities were briefed on the fiscal transparency code in November 1998. The July 1999 mission indicated the elements of the code relevant to the treasury system implementation and recommended a self-assessment against the code. B. Effectiveness of Technical Assistance 5. The introduction of the VAT in 1998 represented a significant step forward, but implementation difficulties have arisen due to tax administration problems and the nature of intergovernmental fiscal relations. Also, treasury reform got off to a slow start. 6. The April 1999 mission on tax administration found that the authorities had made effective use of previous FAD technical assistance. However, significant measures are needed Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-41- ANNEXII to address present weaknesses in tax administration, including the preparation of a strategy by the General Department of National Taxation to strengthen tax administration which identifies the main problems, specifies measures to address them, and indicates areas for TA support. C. Future Needs 7. The authorities have requested a resident advisor for a large taxpayer unit and computer programming assistance for the VAT. This request could be addressed after the strategy paper for strengthening tax administration is completed to ensure proper sequencing and coordination. The authorities should also initiate discussion with the donor community on funding options. Funding for a long-term advisor is available under the FTAP. 8. The authorities are planning to conduct a comprehensive review of intergovernmental fiscal relations to: (i) improve the budgetary planning and implementation process (the intergovernmental transfer system operates largely on a gap-filling basis which creates incentive problems at the local level); (ii) reduce regional disparities (the current assignment of taxes by taxpayer-large state-owned enterprises and all commercial banks pay tax and nontax revenue to the central budget; other taxpayers pay to the local budgets-favors urban provinces at the expense of rural areas); and (iii) enhance the efficiency of the provision of services (local governments have insufficient resources to undertake capital projects in the health and education sectors). The authorities will need to obtain short-term TA on intergovernmental fiscal relations. In the interim, progress could be achieved if the authorities would base their review on the principles of assigning major taxes to the central government and introduce a transparent formula-based intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. 9. TA would be useful in the area of taxation of small business and informal sector activities. The authorities also need to pursue their commitment to eliminate ad hoc tax exemptions and holidays for foreign investment and should consider tapping the natural resource rents from gold. 10. To address skill development needs, the authorities would like to receive training in all areas of fiscal management. II. MONETARY AND EXCHANGE AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT A. Technical Assistance Provided 11. Since June 1996, MAE has provided TA in the areas of bank restructuring, foreign exchange market, payment systems, monetary policy and operations, and central bank accounting. The December 1996-January 1997 MAE advisory missions recommended a bank restructuring strategy, followed up by several expert visits and two advisory missions (July 1997 and March 1998). These missions also covered related aspects of monetary operations, payment systems and foreign exchange operations. For institutional strengthening of the BOM, a long-term accounting advisor was assigned from December 1995-June 1999 to assist in developing a chart of accounts and consolidating the accounting and internal audit Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - ANNEX II functions. A short-term expert was provided in August and October 1996 to help develop a framework and basic instruments of monetary policy and in starting a reserve management program. Another short-term expert visited the BOM in October 1997 to advise on the establishment of an interbank foreign exchange market and the design of an interbank trading system. Finally, a short-term expert was sent to Ulaanbaatar in December 1998 to explore the possibilities of establishing a clearing system jointly owned by the BOM and the commercial banks and to draft interbank clearing and settlement rules. B. Effectiveness of Technical Assistance 12. Overall implementation of the TA has been satisfactory, although timeliness of implementation has remained a problem and has required additional follow up TA. The continuing distress in the banking sector and the gradual approach of the authorities towards resolving the problem have been major factors limiting the effectiveness of TA advice. The development of interbank markets, an effective payments system, and modemization of monetary operations have been undermined by the distress in the banking sector. Timely absorption and follow-through of TA can be further enhanced by skills development in the central bank and in commercial banks. The problems in coordination among the various ,government agencies and the lack of clarity relating to the fimctional and operational autonomy of the BOM in matters of monetary and banking policy have also constrained the leadership role of the BOM in dealing with banking sector problems and in developing the financial system. C. Future Needs 13. MAE has been working closely with the AsDB, USAID and the World Bank in matters of TA and other fmancial sector policy matters. The banking sector strategy under the second annual PRGF arrangement was designed in collaboration with the above agencies, and the AsDB and the USAID are the lead TA providers. Due to the recurring problems in the sector and the presence of several TA providing agencies, it may be useful to devise a TA coordinating arrangement for Mongolia. 14. An early resolution of the outstanding banking sector problems would enable MAE TA to move from short term issues to developing financial markets and instruments, refining the monetary policy framework, and improving banking supervision and payment system. Accounting, disclosure, and audit of BOM operations could be strengthened further. The research capabilities at the BOM should also be further developed to support market operations and supervisory and regulatory functions. The prospective TA would, however, depend upon successful implementation of the actions outlined under the second annual PRGF arrangement, and the approaches taken by other TA providers, including the AsDB and the World Bank. In the short term, TA needs may arise for bank liquidation, legal reform, asset realization and commercial banking, which other donors may be better equipped to provide. . 15. In June 1999, the BOM requested short term assistance for rationalization of government payments in rural areas and provinces (payment systems), conversion of illiquid Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-43 - ANNEXII and nonmarketable government restructuring bonds, and creation of an active primary and secondary markets for treasury bills and government securities. A request was also made for a long-term advisor in banking supervision. A payment system mission visited Ulaanbaatar in September, and an expert in government securities market will visit Mongolia in December. III. STATISTICS DEPARTMENT A. Real Sector Statistics 16. The National Statistical Office (NSO) has a reasonable record of implementing Fund recommendations. TA in national accounts and price statistics was provided in June 1997 and March-May 1998. A follow-up mission in national accounts is scheduled for early 2000 to review progress in implementing previous recommendations on the annual and quarterly compilation systems and to ident@ new issues. However, t$ther strengthening of the NSO is needed in the techniques of index numbers, base years, and deflation, and in its institutional capacity to implement improvements in the statistical system more generally. 17. A monthly consumer price index was introduced and implemented on a timely and continuing basis. Improvements were made to the annual national accounts and surveys, and a system for quarterly estimates of GDP was implemented. The consumer price index is regularly maintained and covers Ulaanbaatar. The 1998 mission recommended updating the consumer expenditure weights and possibly using the available data from other regions to produce a national index. There are also a range of specific prices and unit values for selected agricultural and manufactured products. However, there is no system of producer or trade price indices. 18. The NSO complies a system of annual national accounts based on a range of surveys. The estimates of GDP are based on the production approach. Estimates of expenditure are produced, but remain weak. With the problems of coverage and response quality in a liberalized economy, there is a strong need to develop skills in reconciling alternative data sources. The constant price estimates are limited by the overly aggregated level of deflation and the limited availability of price indices. 19. The authorities considered the effectiveness of Fund TA to be high, but emphasized the need for practical and analytical training through short and long-term TA combined with training through the INS in Vienna, Singapore, and Washington. The authorities also identified the following areas for further TA: (i) quarterly GDP statistics need improvement; (ii) the CPI for Ulaanbaatar needs to be reweighted and a CPI for rural areas needs to be developed; (iii) price indices for producer prices, investment, exports, and imports need to be developed; (iv) the expenditure approach to GDP needs to be strengthened; and (v) estimates need to be constructed for the informal economy.

No missions in government finance statistics have visited Mongolia during the last three years. However, in April 1999, the authorities requested a technical assistance mission on government finance statistics to complement on-going treasury and accounting reform. At that time, STA was unable to comply due to lack of stti resources, but some of the data problems were subsequently resolved through correspondence. C. Money and Banking Statistics 21. TA in money and banking statistics was provided in May-June 1997 to review the procedures for compiling monetary statistics. This followed the introduction in 1996 of the new charts of accounts and improved collection, compilation, and reporting of the money and banking statistics to the Fund. The mission found the BOM’s procedures for collecting and compiling monetary statistics generally consistent with Fund methodology. The mission recommended modifications in the compilation of monetary data to enhance the transparency and analytical usefulness of the statistics and to eliminate errors, including classification errors generated by the introduction of the new charts of accounts, errors arising from the restructuring of the banking system in late 1996, and long-standing deficiencies in the valuation of gold and the recording of Fund accounts. The mission and the authorities agreed on a work program through mid-1998 to improve the coverage and accuracy, and expand the reporting, of money and banking statistics. 22. Subsequent communications received by STA indicated that the authorities implemented major recommendations of the 1997 mission and that the necessary changes in the balance sheet of the BOM and commercial banks were approved in October 1997. In view of the progress achieved in resolving outstanding statistical issues, a follow-up mission in money and banking could provide further guidance on improving the coverage and accuracy. D. Balance of Payments Statistics 23. On balance of payments (BOP) statistics, Mongolia received a TA mission in May 1997 (the fourth in a series of visits that began in March 1991). The mission reviewed the progress that had been made in conducting surveys to improve balance of payments compilation. However, serious weaknesses remained in the statistics, especially because exchange records were incomplete and private sector external transactions were poorly covered. The mission also noted that the groundwork had been laid by the authorities for long-term technical assistance to be effective. Consequently, a long-term advisor was assigned in March 1999 to assist the BOM in implementing the recommendations of the 1997 mission. Overall, the TA has enabled the authorities to compile and disseminate BOP statistics and to make gradual progress in improving the quality of the data, but further progress is needed. The BOP and international investment position are compiled quarterly and annually in accordance with the fifth edition of the BOP Manual. Dissemination to official bodies, both domestic and foreign is good, but access to the public needs to be improved. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-45 - ANNEX II E. Data Dissemination 24. Recently, Mongolia revised its Statistical Law and commissioned a Masterplan for the Development of the System of Official Statistics. In this connection, the NSO, which had previously communicated to the Fund its strong interest in participating in the GDDS, requested the Fund to review the Master-plan for alignment with the GDDS. These issues will be explored mrther in November 1999. The Mongolian authorities have also expressed an interest in a review of dissemination practices in statistics. It is agreed that such an exercise would be desirable in the first half of 2000, resources permitting. IV. LEGAL DEPARTMENT 25. During the June 1999 mission, the Legal Department identified legal impediments to commercial banks’ efforts to recover debts and enforce collateral arrangements and suggested the need to: (i) strengthen and protect the rights of secured creditors under the Bankruptcy law; and (ii) improve the post-judgment execution process and foreclosure procedures. 26. The authorities agreed that the general Bankruptcy Law needs to be strengthened and enforcement of court judgements needs to be improved, but stressed that priority should be placed on developing legislation for dealing with bank bankruptcy. The general bankruptcy law does not deal effectively with bank bankruptcy, and a specialized law is required. The authorities have completed the first draft of the bank bankruptcy law and would like assistance in shaping it further. 27. TA is required for the proposed revision of the Currency and Foreign Exchange Law to ensure conformity with Mongolia’s Article VIII status.

Progress to date The Mongolian authorities have established a framework for monitoring macroeconomic developments with extensive technical assistance, including from the Fund. Core data are provided on a timely basis and IFS and GFS country pages have been published since 1994. Mongolia has shown interest in participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and has appointed a country coordinator. An STA mission to assist the authorities in preparing GDDS metadata and report on the observance of standards and codes (data module) is tentatively scheduled to take place in the first half of 2000. 2. . . . . 3. Outstanding issues While significant progress has been made in developing a national accounts framework, the quality of GDP estimates could be improved further. In particular, raw data could be refined with a view to producing quarterly estimates and a breakdown of GDP by expenditure categories. In this regard, staff capabilities could be improved to ensure greater analysis and data reconciliation. The CPI weights may need to be reviewed to reflect shifts in expenditure patterns. In addition, the geographical coverage of the CPI could be expanded. The authorities intend to correct deficiencies in the compilation of money and banking statistics, including standard valuation principles and classif5cation of accounts, The quality of data provided for publication in the GFS Yearbook could be improved substantially. The authorities have provided revisions to historical data, and new data through 1998, which will be published in the 1999 GFS Yearbook. However, the poor quality of the monthly data reported for publication in IFS has meant that the latest data published in IFS are for October 1996. Publications The State Statistical Office publishes timely monthly, quarterly, and annual Statistical Bulletins in English and Mongolian. These bulletins include data on population, employment, national accounts and prices, household income and expenditure, central and local government revenue and expenditure, and external trade. The BOM publishes a monthly Statistical BuZZetin (within 15 days of the end of the month which includes summary statistics for the central bank, consolidated balance sheet of commercial banks, and interest and exchange rate data) and Annual Reports since 1993. All publications are available to the public.

A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 1998-2000 was approved by the Board on June 2, 1998. The primary goal of the CAS is to support the government through lending and nonlending services in completing the transition to a market-led economy, improve living standards, and reduce poverty. Completed lending operations: An Economic Rehabilitation Credit (US$30 million) and a TechnicalAssistance Credit (US$5 million), both approved in December 1991, have been fully disbursed. An Economic Transition Support Credit (US$20 million), approved in October 1993, to finance critical imports and technical assistance for the mining and transport sectors was also folly disbursed. Ongoing lending operations: The current portfolio comprises six active projects. The Transport Rehabilitation Credit (US%3 0 million), approved in May 1994, addresses key constraints in the transport sector, particularly by arresting the deterioration of the quality and quantity of transport services in railways, urban transport, trucking, and roads. The Poverq Alleviation for VuZnerabZe Groups Credit (US%10 million), approved in July 1995, is part of a multi-donor effort supporting the government’s Poverty Alleviation Program. It aims to promote income-generating activities for the poor, raise basic education enrollment rates, reduce maternal mortality, and assist the disabled, particularly children. The Coal Project (US$3 5 million), approved in May 1996, is helping to upgrade operations and management of the Baganuur coal mine and finance training in mine operation, mine management, and feasibility studies. The policy-based Banking and Enterprise Adjustment Credit (US%10 million, closed December 3 1, 1998) and an associated Banking, Enterprise and LegaZ Technical Assistance Credit (US$2 million) became effective in November 1997. These operations are assisting the government in implementing its structural reform programs in the financial and enterprise sectors and in developing the legal framework for commercial and financial transactions. The UZaanbaatar Services Improvement Project is helping to upgrade water supply and sanitation facilities in the capital’s low-income ger districts; it became effective in July 1998. In addition, a Fiscal Technical Assistance Project was approved by the Board in June 1998 and became effective in February 1999. This project supports the development of an efficient and transparent government financial management system and the introduction of a value-added tax to strengthen the government’s revenue base. A Private Sector Development Credit was approved in May 1999. It supports the development of Mongolia’s private enterprise and financial sectors. Credit approvals and disbursements are shown in the Table. Future lending operations: Future IDA lending will continue to concentrate on supporting macroeconomic stabilization and structural adjustment programs, investment projects, and technical assistance. Credits are being proposed in support of a financial sector adjustment operation, facilitating private sector development, developing infrastructure and energy, and supporting equity through the government’s poverty reduction programs.

A Poverty Assessment and a Public Enterprise Review were completed in FY96. A report on the consequences of large-scale privatization, prepared in collaboration with the University of Maryland, was completed in early 1998. A Transport Strategy Study was completed in FY99. World Bank staff participate regularly in ESAF missions and in the preparation of Policy Framework Papers (PFP). The World Bank opened an office in Ulaanbaatar in June 1998. The first Country Portfolio Performance Review was held in June 1999. Future non- lending services will include a financial sector development paper, a poverty update report, a new public expenditure review, and the Eighth Assistance Group Meeting. Aid coordination: The World Bank continues to play a strong role in aid coordination. Six Assistance Group Meetings of donors took place in Tokyo since 1991, co-chaired by the World Bank and the Government of Japan. The seventh and most recent meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar in June 1999. In addition, the World Bank (IDA, FIAS, IFC and MIGA) is assisting the government with the promotion of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The first Investors’ Conference, on oil, gas and mining, was held in Ulaanbaatar in June 1997, and the second, on agro-industry and tourism, took place in Ulaanbaatar in June 1998. IFC: Mongolia is part of IFC’s Extending Reach Program, an initiative to promote private sector development and investment in selected countries where difficult country conditions have constrained IFC activity. As part of this program, IFC has invested in a small leather garmenting operation and is currently considering projects in the tourism, cashmere, and banking sectors. IFC has also mobilized trust funds to conduct technical assistance in developing a tourism development program and in helping draft Mongolia’s leasing law. IFC has assisted in conducting two foreign investment seminars to promote FDI. IFC’s investment strategy in Mongolia is to provide long-term fmancing to private companies, improve the investment framework in the country, and assist in attracting technical know- how and foreign investment.

AsDB operations in Mongolia during 1994-99 have been guided by its Country Operational Strategy (COS) prepared in 1994, which aimed at facilitating Mongolia’s transition to a market economy by: i) creating an environment in which a competitive efficient market economy can flourish; ii) developing the human resources and skills necessary for a market economy; and iii) developing the infrastructure needed for a market economy. The AsDB is now in the process of devising a new COS for its operations in Mongolia in the next five years. The new COS will acknowledge that despite successful program and project implementation in the past five years and reasonably high rates of economic growth, two main areas of need for further focus have emerged: (i) poverty in Mongolia has remained at very high levels and, although stable, is deepening; and (ii) gains from economic growth have not been utilized efficiently due to poor governance in sectors. The AsDB’s new strategy for Mongolia is designed as a poverty reduction strategy which emphasizes employment generation within the private sector as its main focus to reduce poverty, while continuing with interventions in health, education, and urban development to improve human development standards. Due to the continuing difficult Asian Development Fund (ADF) situation, the Indicative Planning Figure (IPF, which determines AsDB’s average lending to the country) for Mongolia was adjusted from $60 million to $40 million per annum for lending, and $4 million annually for technical assistance (TA) grants. The level of actual lending in each year will depend upon (i) ADF tinds availability; (ii) the government’s continuing efforts to improve macroeconomic management and implement structural reforms; (iii) satisfactory project performance in the AsDB’s Mongolian portfolio; (iv) the status of project preparation; and (v) availability of counterpart funds. By end-November 1999, the AsDB had approved 20 loans from the Asian Development Fund totaling $402.5 million. In addition, by that date the AsDB had approved 83 TA grants amounting to $41.5 million. AsDB has taken a lead role in several key sectors (e.g,, policy and institutional reforms in the agriculture sector, public administration reforms, education, health, finance, roads, telecommunications, power, air navigation, and housing). In terms of new lending and technical assistance, three loans that were confrrmed by the Government to have high priority (cadastral survey and land registration, governance reforms in the public sector, and the second road project) were processed in 1999. Of these three, the second road project ($25 million) was approved by the Board of the AsDB on September 30, 1999; the governance reform program is expected to be considered by the Board in early December; and the cadastral survey is due for Board consideration by late December. Technical assistance grants totaling $5 million will also be provided by the AsDB this year. ‘Prepared by Asian Development Bank staff.

Such dialogue aims at developing a sound policy framework, promoting sector restructuring, strengthening institutions, developing human resources, improving economic efficiency, and enhancing governance, The AsDB has regularly participated in Mongolia Assistance Group meetings and coordinated its operations with IMF, World Bank and other donors. At the Seventh Assistance Group Meeting in Ulaanbaatar in June 1999, the AsDB was assigned as the lead donor organization to oversee aid coordination in the area of governance reforms. In December 1998 the AsDB’s Board approved new policies on hardening of terms of its lending and technical assistance to its member countries. Under the newly agreed terms, the grant element of new ADF lending (for which Mongolia remains eligible) will be reduced from 77 to 65 percent, and the countries’ share in cost-sharing for technical assistance projects will be redefined. New loans will carry the following terms: For project loans other than quick-disbursing program loans, the new terms are 32-years maturity, &years grace period, 1 percent interest charge during the grace period and 1.5 percent during the amortization period, and equal amortization. For quick-disbursing program loans, the new terms are 24-years maturity, &years grace period, 1 percent interest charge during the grace period and 1.5 percent during the amortization period, and equal amortization. The AsDB can finance up to 80 percent of the total loan project cost. The remaining 20 percent should be financed by the Government/executing agency and other sources (such as cofmancing).

Earlier this year in May, we wrote to inform you of the government’s revised Policy Framework Paper for 1999-2001 and its macroeconomic adjustment program for 1999. Since that time, the government has implemented this program in an aggressive manner with bold actions taken in the area of bank restructuring, privatization and public administration reform. Marcoeconomic performance under the program has been satisfactory with continued low inflation and strong real GDP growth in 1999. 2. Under the second annual PRGF arrangement, all quantitative performance criteria for end-September were met. The program of structural reform is also broadly on track. However, as a result of unavoidable delays in completing certain procedural requirements, the Trade and Development Bank (TDB) could not be brought to the point of sale by end- September; these procedures are now expected to be completed by end-March 2000. Moreover, we appointed receivers for Reconstruction Bank and IT1 Bank without first taking certain intermediate steps contemplated under the arrangement with respect to these two banks. With the reform of the banking system ahead of schedule in many respects, we hereby request a waiver for the nonobservance of the performance criteria related to these banks. 3. Attached to this letter is a Memorandum on the Economic and Financial Policies of the Government of Mongolia for 2000 which supplements the Memorandum attached to our letter of May 21. This memorandum lays out, among other things, the main features of the government’s fiscal program for 2000 and the next steps to be taken in its bank restructuring program. In the light of the fiscal program for 2000, we have revised the quantitative financial targets for March 2000 to take account, in particular, of the seasonal demand for domestic budgetary financing in the early part of the year. The revised quantitative performance criteria for the next test date under the second annual arrangement are set out in Table 2 attached to the Memorandum. 4. In line with the government’s bank reform strategy, a third insolvent bank (the Agriculture Bank) has also been placed under receivership, ahead of the schedule anticipated in the program, but the government has decided to restructure that bank along lines developed in consultation with Fund staff As part of this plan, the government intends to foster alternative mechanisms for handling the government payments function, as envisaged in the original program, but it does not believe that it is possible to remove this function entirely from the Agricultural Bank at the present time.

The government believes that the policies and measures described in the attached memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of its program for 2000. The government will consult with the Managing Director, at the initiative of either party, in the event that additional measures are deemed necessary. The government will also provide information requested by the Fund to monitor the program, and will complete a second review of the second-year arrangement by May 2000. ISI Y. Ochirsukh Minister of Finance Sincerely yours, IS/ J, Unenbat Governor, Bank of Mongolia Attachment Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - ATTACHMEm Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of the Government of Mongolia 1. This memorandum supplements our Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) of May 1999 in the light of recent economic developments and policy performance, and sets out the broad macroeconomic framework and the government’s fiscal program for 2000. Given the partial reversal of earlier declines in the terms of trade and the continuing recovery of activity in regional economies, the growth of exports and GDP is now projected to be somewhat stronger in the near term. Reflecting the prudent stance of macroeconomic policies, all quantitative performance criteria for the government’s PRGF-supported program for end-September 1999 were met. Great strides have also been made in adopting bold structural reform measures, especially in the banking system. The revised macroeconomic framework for 1999-2000 is summarized in Table 1 and the associated targets and quantitative performance criteria through end-March 2000 are set out in Table 2. The structural performance criteria and benchmarks for Executive Board consideration of the second annual PRGF arrangement are reproduced in Table 3a; the revised structural performance criteria and benchmarks for the period through end-March 2000 are presented in Table 3 b. Fiscal Policy 2. With the help of the package of measures introduced under the supplementary budget in mid-1999, the overall budget deficit is being contained to just under 10 percent of GDP in 1999. Net foreign financing is estimated to have amounted to the equivalent of about 9 percent of GDP in 1999, as envisaged in the supplementary budget. On that basis, net domestic bank financing of the government is being limited, as targeted, to less than 1 percent of GDP in 1999. 3. The 2000 budget, which was approved by Parliament on December 1, 1999, aims to eliminate the need for any further net domestic bank financing, so as to maintain fiscal sustainability, prevent a resurgence of inflation, and make room for an adequate expansion of credit to the private sector. Based on conservative assumptions about receipts from privatization and new concessional external financing, the overall budget deficit is targeted to decline to around 7% percent of GDP in 2000. In the event that privatization receipts exceed the amount envisaged in the budget, one half of the surplus receipts will be used to increase high-priority investment in infrastructure development and the remainder to reduce the outstanding stock of net domestic debt to the banking system; if there is a larger-than-programmed inflow of program loans, the local currency proceeds will be used fully to reduce domestic debt. 4. The 2000 budget remains geared to reversing the recent decline in the revenue-to-GDP ratio, while strengthening discipline and improving prioritization of public expenditure. Total revenue is targeted to rise to around 28’/4 percent of GDP in 2000, reflecting a partial recovery of income taxes and dividends from the copper sector, and the full-year effects of the customs duties and the excise tax on beer introduced in mid-l 999. Total expenditure is targeted to decline to about 36 percent of GDP in 2000. To help achieve that objective, expenditures on goods and services will be tightly controlled and low-priority domestically-financed investment spending will be strictly limited. Steps will also be taken to progressively focus the government Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-58- ATTACHMENT on core functions and increase its efficiency in the context of the AsDB-supported Governance Program, so as to moderate the cost of a 25 percent civil service wage increase which would take effect on January 1,200O. The budget envisages an adequate allocation for domestic interest payments to ensure that there is full provision for the servicing of public debt. 5. The government attaches high priority to establishing the integrity of public debt. Cash flow problems resulted in a build-up of arrears on domestic interest payments over the last two years, The nonpayment of interest on restructuring bonds, in particular, has threatened the liquidity and solvency of the Savings Bank and undermined the financial position of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM), which was already burdened by the need to make provisions for its loans to insolvent banks. This further weakened the prospects for any significant transfer of central bank profits to the budget, impairing effective coordination of fiscal and monetary policies. To address these problems, the government has cleared all domestic interest arrears and signed a payment agreement to regularize all financial relations between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the BOM. Furthermore, to reassure market participants that all interest payments will henceforth be made in a timely manner, the government has also signed a service contract with the BOM, as its fiscal agent, stipulating that the full amount of interest due each month on restructuring bonds be automatically transferred on the last business day of the month from the treasury’s central budget account at the BOM to the accounts of payees. These contracts will stay in place until all restructuring bonds have been converted into marketable securities and a liquid secondary market has developed. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 6. To cement one of Mongolia’s most significant policy achievements of the past three years, the principal objective of monetary policy will be to maintain a single digit inflation rate. In the near term, inflationary pressures could intensify moderately reflecting recent developments, including the disruption of oil supplies from Russia, the increase in the world price of oil, and upward adjustments in public enterprise tariff rates. In the coming months, the BOM will continue to take steps to sterilize the monetary impact of its higher-than-anticipated gold operations undertaken earlier in the year through additional placement of BOM bills. For 2000, achievement of the inflation target is expected to be consistent with a moderation in reserve money growth. Towards this end, the BOM will strictly limit lending to the government and commercial banks. This reserve money growth is expected to be consistent with achieving the program targets for total domestic bank credit to government, taking into account a normal seasonal increase in the government’s demand for BOM financing in the first quarter of the year. The overall monetary aggregates would allow adequate room for credit expansion to the private sector. With the decline in inflation during 1998-1999, the yield on central bank bills has been progressively lowered, but remains positive in real terms. The yields on restructuring bonds and deposits with the Savings Bank have declined broadly in line with BOM bill rate. As fiscal policy is tightened, banking reforms are implemented, and the near-term inflationary pressures abate, a continuing gradual reduction in domestic interest rates should be feasible in 2000. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 59 - ATTACHMENT 7. Following a period of real currency appreciation in the first half of 1998, the BOM allowed the togrog to depreciate in real effective terms. In the recent months, there has been a modest recovery in the prices for Mongolia’s major exports, but these changes have been offset by higher world oil prices. The BOM considers the current level of the exchange rate broadly appropriate and consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals. Looking forward, the BOM will continue to operate a flexible exchange rate regime and will limit intervention to that necessary to smooth excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate and allow a further modest accumulation of reserves. This policy, together with the quantitative targets for the credit and monetary aggregates, should be sufficient to achieve a US$l5 million increase in net official international reserves in 2000, raising the import cover of gross reserves to 14% weeks. 8. To improve monetary management, the BOM has recently introduced central bank bills of different maturities, imposed penalties to ensure strict compliance with the prescribed reserve requirements, and applied appropriate sanctions on banks that do not comply with the prudential requirements. In the interest of transparency, the BOM has taken steps to improve its accounting and budgeting systems, and strengthened its disclosure policies. In the period ahead, the government will maintain a stable and transparent monetary policy regime, with a view to achieving the objectives of the program. To facilitate an active and efficient interbank foreign exchange market, the BOM has completed a review of the foreign currency clearing and settlement procedures and has taken steps, including daily reporting of foreign exchange position by banks, to ensure compliance with the prescribed limits on foreign exchange exposure. The BOM has also taken steps to ensure that its own guidelines on management, valuation, and accounting of foreign exchange reserves are consistent with international standards. Banking Sector Reform 9. The government is taking decisive action to resolve the financial situation of troubled banks. The Reconstruction Bank and ITI Bank, which had been placed under conservatorship in April and May, respectively, have been downsized aggressively through branch closures, retrenchment of staff, expenditure cuts, asset sales, and intensified loan recovery. To shore up public confidence, household deposits were either paid off or transferred to the Savings Bank and Agriculture Bank. At the same time, external audits were launched to determine the banks’ true financial position and existing shareholders were invited to provide new capital. With no new private capital forthcoming, the banks were placed under receivership in October 1999. The two banks are now slated for liquidation. Their licenses were revoked in December. 10. In the case of the Agriculture Bank, although the existing shareholders’ rights were extinguished after the bank was placed under receivership in October, liquidation has been ruled out for now to prevent a loss of public confidence and limit the strain on the administrative capacity of the BOM. Steps have been taken to downsize the bank and reduce operating costs. The government is preparing a restructuring plan in accordance with the provisions of receivership to strengthen the commercially viable operations with a view to privatization. This plan has been formulated with Fund staff and a recapitalization of the bank may be undertaken in accordance with this plan. The government will continue to promote the performance of its Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 60 - ATTACHMENT payments function through alternative mechanisms. The monetary policy guidelines for 2000 will incorporate downsizing of the bank as a key element of the government’s policy. 11. The BOM and the government are continuing their efforts to upgrade the legal and regulatory framework for the banking system. Amendments to the Banking Law introduced in July 1999 enhanced the powers of conservators and receivers, enabling them to extinguish shareholders’ rights in insolvent banks and to better enforce loan recovery. Additional amendments will be introduced in consultation with the Fund staff, to strengthen safeguards for the use of public funds in resolving the situation of problem banks. In September, the minimum paid-up capital was increased to 1 billion togrog and made applicable to all banks. The supervisory capacity at the BOM is being strengthened by hiring new staff and training in supervisory skills. Regulations governing the operations of nonbank financial institutions have also been introduced, and their operations have been brought under the supervisory purview of the BOM. A list of loan defaulters is being published regularly. Public Sector Reforms and Privatization 12. The government is committed to limiting the size and improving the efficiency of the core public sector while outsourcing or privatizing noncore activities. As a fist step in the comprehensive reform of public sector management, the government has selected the Finance Ministry and the Cabinet Secretariat as pilot agencies, which would have enhanced discretion over the use of their budget allocations during the last two months of 1999. This would create incentives for managers to economize on nonessential purchases. Any resulting savings will be used to allow some differentiation of civil service wages on the basis of performance. To ensure an appropriate degree of accountability, the government will establish as a matter of priority clear guidelines and procedures for the exercise of discretion in budgetary management and for the conduct of performance review by external auditors. The results of this pilot project will be evaluated early in 2000 in consultation with the AsDB to establish the feasibility of extending this management reform to other government agencies. To help monitor and assess the outcome of the project, the government will compile quarterly data on civil service employment disaggregated by agency. 13. Strong action is also needed to improve the governance of public enterprises and reduce their involvement in activities that could be more efficiently conducted by the private sector. Extended delays in tariff adjustment have in the past been a major factor undermining the fmancial position of key public enterprises. The government has recently taken important steps to adjust a number of public enterprise tariffs, To improve pricing decisions and allow enterprises to operate on a commercial basis, public enterprises will be granted greater managerial autonomy, including with respect to pricing decisions. Regular fmancial audits will be instituted to help assess the true financial position of the major public enterprises. A Cabinet resolution instructing the Mongolian members to call on Erdenet’s Board of Directors to initiate an audit of Erdenet by an internationally-recognized accounting firm was adopted on December 8. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-61 - ATTACHMENT 14. The government has taken important steps to expand its program of public enterprise privatization to include the Most Valuable Companies (MVCs). The technical work for the privatization of the National Oil Import Concern (NE) and the Gobi Cashmere Company has been completed and the two companies are expected to be brought to the point of sale by end- December, as envisaged under the program. Although it has not been possible to bring the Trade and Development Bank (TDB) to the point of sale by the target date of end-September, the audit for 1998 by an international accounting firm and due diligence are now complete. The new charter for the TDB has been approved and all preparatory work to enable the government to seek parliamentary approval to bring the bank to the point of sale will be completed by March 31, 2000. External Sector Policies and Program Financing 15. With the improving external environment, the recovery of exports and GDP growth is now projected to be stronger in 2000 than was previously envisaged. However, a faster than expected pick-up in domestic demand would also lead to a rapid expansion of imports, keeping the current account deficit close to 9 percent of GDP. Replenishment of international reserves and the balance of payments financing needs can be met only partially by existing commitments by bilateral and multilateral donors. A financing gap of US$lO-12 million during 2000 is expected to be filled by financial assistance from the World Bank. 16. The government recognizes that it is essential to maintain regular relations with foreign creditors. To this end, the government has approached creditors to agree on the payment modalities for the remainder of 1999 and amounts due in 2000. The government will remain current on all external obligations, and the non-accumulation of external payments arrears will be a performance criterion on a continuous basis. The government will continue to pursue a cautious external borrowing strategy and will refrain from contracting or guaranteeing non- concessional external borrowing during the program period. 17. A liberal and non-distortionary trade regime is essential for Mongolia’s economic development. Owing to the fragile state of the public finances, the government considers it premature, at this point, to withdraw the import duties introduced in 1999. However, the government will consider the possibility of reducing the seasonal import duties on flour and vegetables which were introduced in September 1998 at rates of 1 O-l 5 percent to the common level of 5 percent, effective April 2000. During the period of the PRGF program, the government will not impose or intensify restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions; will not introduce or modify multiple currency practices; will not conclude bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles; and will not impose or intensify import restrictions for balance of payments reasons.
