High oil prices and a weak U.S. dollar have pushed up export earnings and growth in recent years and inflation has been low. However, growth slowed in 2007 because of a decline in oil output and business confidence.  • Outlook and risks. The outlook is clouded by uncertainties over the new constitution and pending decisions on key policies. Adoption of a policy package along the lines discussed with staff could lead to a recovery in growth in late 2008, improved macroeconomic performance over the medium term, and more rapid poverty-reduction. However, there are clear downside risks if such a package does not emerge. • Focus. Beyond fiscal and financial system vulnerabilities, discussions covered fiscal space for investment and social spending; and lowering the cost and increasing the availability of credit.  (cid:190) Fiscal policy. Plans to significantly ramp up spending are sustainable at the current oil price and production outlook, but the staff emphasized the need to ensure quality of spending and avoid further dependence on oil revenues. Staff welcomed plans to upgrade tax administration and introduce comprehensive reforms to PetroEcuador. (cid:190) Financial system. The authorities are no longer considering directed lending or tighter interest rate ceilings. Staff welcomed plans to upgrade the financial safety net and bank resolution framework and urged improved supervision and supervisory autonomy. • Fund relations. Ecuador has no outstanding obligations to the Fund. The last Article IV consultation was held on January 25, 2006. Ecuador is an Article VIII member but maintains an exchange restriction arising from a ½ percent tax on remittances of foreign exchange abroad for the making of payments and transfers on current international transactions. • Statistics. Data for surveillance are adequate overall. However, shortcomings exist in the balance of payments, in particular with respect to private capital flows, and in the government financial statistics, where coverage of non-financial enterprises is incomplete. • Mission. The mission, during November 7–16, 2007, comprised Mr. Alleyne (head), Ms. Frantischek, and Mr. Flores (all WHD); Ms. Madrid (MCM); Mr. Rother (PDR); and Mr. Guzman (Res. Rep.). Mr. Perez (OED) attended most meetings. The team met with the Minister of Finance and other senior government officials, the general manager of the central bank, and private sector representatives.

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SETTING 1.      Despite vulnerabilities, macroeconomic performance in recent years has been strong, supported by favorable global conditions. Helped by high oil prices, growth averaged 5½  percent a year during 2002–06—the highest 5-year average in a quarter century. For Ecuador’s formally dollarized economy, a depreciating U.S. dollar has enabled the non-oil sector to maintain competitiveness and avoid potential “Dutch Disease” problems. Inflation has converged to international levels at around 2 percent; the external current account has shifted from a deficit to a strong surplus; gross public debt has fallen below 35 percent of GDP; and the government accumulated large deposits in its oil funds. These factors contributed to a two-notch ratings upgrade by Standard & Poors last November. However, its sovereign bond spread remains the highest in the region, reflecting lingering financial vulnerabilities (Figure 1):  • In the dollarized financial system: no lender of last resort; inadequate bank resolution framework; and an unfunded deposit insurance scheme. • In the public finances: budget rigidities; large and growing use of volatile oil revenues to cover NFPS primary spending.  2.      However, economic activity decelerated sharply in 2007, despite the improvement in the terms of trade. Oil output declined by over 6 percent in the first three quarters of the year, reflecting long-standing problems of underinvestment and poor governance at the state oil company, PetroEcuador. At the same time, non-oil growth fell significantly, as credit conditions tightened and a drop in business confidence led to a fall in private investment. Initially, confidence was negatively affected by concerns about the government’s willingness to service its external debt and its plans to lower ceilings on interest rates and introduce directed lending. More recently, sentiment has been weighed down by a presidential decree raising the tax on oil windfall revenues of foreign companies from 50 percent to 99 percent; uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the constituent assembly; and concerns over government’s legislative plans in key areas such as the budget, taxes, and the banking system (Figure 2).

The NFPS primary surplus is estimated to have declined last year owing to a large jump in spending. For the first three quarters of 2007, primary spending rose by almost 20 percent, including a 63 percent jump in capital spending, a 17 percent increase in the wage bill, and a doubling of the targeted social safety net transfers to the poor. Meanwhile, untargeted fuel subsidies increased to an estimated 6 percent of GDP. For the year as a whole, the NFPS surplus is projected to have declined to 1.9 percent of GDP. 4.      The external current account surplus narrowed in the first half of 2007, in line with a weakening in export performance. Lower oil export volumes and a decline in international prices for some of Ecuador’s key non-oil exports led to a 5 percent decline (year-on-year) in total export earnings in the first half of 2007, while imports grew by 12 percent over the same period.

Notwithstanding vulnerabilities, systemic banking indicators remain generally positive. After falling during the first quarter, system deposits have recovered to above end-December 2006 levels but growth remains significantly off the pace of a year ago. Liquidity and capital adequacy ratios are strong, while nonperforming loans, though up slightly  compared with end-2006, are still substantially below the level of previous years. Only a few small banks, representing 3 percent of banking system assets, suffer from low capital and liquidity but there are risks from the impact of the July 2007 banking law (See Box 1 and  paragraph 13).  6.      Poverty has declined in recent years but remains high. Macroeconomic stability and economic growth have helped reduce poverty since the 1999-2000 economic crisis. However, at close to 40 percent, the poverty rate is above the level of the mid-1990s (see Figure 1), while income inequality continues to be high (Gini coefficient: 0.531).  89101112131415161718101520253035Liquid asset in percent of total assetsNote: Cropped axes.Capital Adequacy RatioBanks' Liquidity and Soudness, October 2007       Bubble proportional to assets sizeWith just a couple of exceptions, banks arewell capitalized and  liquid.Financial Soundness Indicators2004200520062007 1/Capital in percent of risk-adjusted assets14.514.414.815.7NPLs in percent of total loans 6.44.93.33.6Provisions in percent of NPLs119.0143.7182.7169.8Return on average assets (in percent)1.21.52.01.9Ratio of liquid assets to deposits 37.235.531.232.51/ October data for 2007.EcuadorSouth America & MexicoLatin America3035404550556019992005                                        Income Inequality       (Gini coefficient; larger figures indicate greater income inequality) 1/Sources: ECLAC; and De Ferranti et al.

The 2008 political calendar has significant implications for the economic outlook. The constituent assembly, in which the government’s party has an overwhelming majority, began its 6–8 month term at the end of November. Apart from writing a new constitution, the assembly will also enact new legislation, having temporarily taken over the legislative functions of the congress. The new draft constitution will be put to a referendum in the third quarter of 2008. If approved, new presidential and congressional elections would likely take place before the end of the year.  II.   THE GOVERNMENT’S ECONOMIC PROGRAM 8.      The government has pledged comprehensive political and economic changes to improve social welfare, and promote equity-enhancing growth. Its strategy entails strong public sector actions aimed at: bolstering resources directed to health, education, housing, and social safety net; actively promoting the development of small- and medium-sized private enterprises; and raising the competitiveness and productivity of the non-oil sector by reducing energy and transportation costs. 9.      These objectives underlie the government’s focus on the following areas: • Government spending. A strong expansion of public spending aimed at enhancing social and economic infrastructures, as well as providing financial support to the small and medium enterprise sector. • Tax reform. Improved tax administration to raise revenues to finance the higher spending; and increasing the income tax share relative to the VAT, for equity reasons.  • Fiscal framework. Measures designed to increase expenditure flexibility, and improve the transparency and control of the central government’s financial management. • Debt management. A strategy aimed at broadening the creditor base and reducing annual debt service to free up resources for priority spending. • Oil sector. Boosting state oil revenues by a comprehensive reform of PetroEcuador and a renegotiation of contracts with foreign companies to boost the government take. • Financial system. Measures aimed at reducing underlying vulnerabilities, reducing credit cost, and broadening its access. III.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS 10.      The importance of addressing many of the above issues has long been a part of Fund policy advice. However, owing to an inability to forge a broad political consensus little progress was made in recent years in tax reform, improving fiscal flexibility, addressing vulnerabilities in the banking system, or reforming state enterprises in the oil and electricity sector. The current authorities are confident that they have the political mandate to push through the needed Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public   9measures. The Article IV mission provided a valuable opportunity for an exchange of ideas while the authorities were still working out the details on all key policy initiatives. Draft legislation is expected to be submitted to the constituent assembly shortly. A.   Financial System  Expensive and inaccessible credit is a key obstacle to growth. Proposals to address this problem are positive developments. Planned actions to lower the risk to financial stability should be accelerated.  Policies to reduce the cost of credit 11.      Initially, the authorities’ strategy to reduce the cost of credit centered on administrative measures. The cost of credit is one of the highest in the region (Figure 3). To address this concern, the authorities submitted draft legislation in May to tighten ceilings on lending rates, eliminate commissions, and introduce direct lending. However, the bill approved by congress moderated the authorities’ proposal somewhat, in particular, by rejecting directed lending and establishing a higher ceiling on lending rates (Box 1). A positive outcome of the new legislation has been the publication of effective lending rates of each bank, which, by enhancing transparency, should help promote competition going forward. In the six months since the measure has been in effect, average interest rates have declined slightly, but in certain segments, such as microcredit, the elimination of commissions has resulted in higher interest rates and a reduction in credit.   Box 1. Ecuador: Banking Law  In May 2007, the government submitted to congress draft legislation that: (i) tightened controls on the costs and allocation of credit, and (ii) granted the banking board, which would be dominated by government representatives and exclude central bank officials, broader powers to establish credit, liquidity, and regulatory guidelines (removing those responsibilities from the central bank and the bank superintendent).  In July, congress approved a banking law that stiffened regulations on credit costs but rejected articles that shifted power to the banking board or imposed directed lending. In particular, the law: (i) eliminated commissions on loans; (ii) replaced the previous overall ceiling on lending rates with ceilings by type of credit (commercial, housing, consumption, and micro credit); (iii) designated the central bank to set up monthly ceilings on the basis of previous month’s average lending rates plus two standard deviations; and (iv) instituted ceilings on service fees charged by banks.

The authorities’ strategy is now focused on raising institution-level efficiency, and reducing intermediation costs. They indicated that they were no longer considering any new administrative measures to force lower rates or affect credit allocation.1 Rather, they shared the staff’s view that, to reduce costs, it would be preferable for the superintendency of banks to work with institutions to establish timetables to meet certain efficiency benchmarks. In this context, the staff recommended that the authorities look at the case of Banco del Pacífico, which, following a comprehensive efficiency building program, had risen from insolvency to become the third largest commercial bank in the system and the most profitable. The authorities also indicated that they were in discussions with the IDB to revive a policy-based loan that would support legal reforms to strengthen creditor rights and bankruptcy procedures.  Policies to strengthen stability of the financial system 13.      The risk of financial instability persists. Given the vulnerabilities described above, the staff argued that there is an urgent need to make the financial system more resilient. Without an adequate safety net or resolution framework, any given shock to the system could trigger a serious loss of confidence and compromise stability. In this context, the elimination of loan commissions could put under stress a number of—mostly  small—inefficient  institutions that relied heavily on this source of income (Figure 4). Thus far, the institutions under the jurisdiction of the superintendency of banks have not experienced much change in profitability. However, with maximum fees and interest rates on a declining trend, profits could be squeezed unless banks can increase loan volumes or reduce costs quickly. Moreover, a large number of financial cooperatives currently at risk fall under the supervisory jurisdiction of the ministry of social welfare, subject to inadequate supervision and regulation, and for which there are no reliable data. If any unsupervised cooperative were to experience difficulties, there may be contagion risk to other cooperatives or small banks. 14.      At the technical level, the authorities have begun to formulate plans to address key vulnerabilities. Officials at the superintendency are developing a plan to intensify supervision of at-risk institutions under its jurisdiction and promote mergers and acquisitions. With assistance from the IDB and USAID, and in consultation with the banks, the authorities are also working on a plan to strengthen the financial safety net. Though still at an early stage, plans included the following: • Lender of last resort. A public-private liquidity fund would eventually cover about  10 percent of bank deposits (equivalent to 100 percent of regulatory capital), versus the current coverage of 1½ percent. To reach this target, the existing liquidity fund would be topped up mostly by the transfer of 75 percent of the current reserve requirements; 40                                                  1 However, they have reached an agreement with the banks to fine tune the methodology for setting maximum interest rates for different types of credit, replacing the two standard deviation range currently mandated by the law with risk spreads. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public   12percent of banks’ annual contribution to the existing deposit guarantee agency (AGD); central bank profits; and contingent credit lines arranged with international financial institutions such as the Andean Development Corporation.  • Deposit insurance scheme. A new dedicated fund would be set up, funded by the existing stock of AGD funds (1 percent of deposits) plus the equivalent of 60 percent of banks’ annual contribution to AGD (0.4 percent of deposit liabilities). Premiums would include both a fixed and a risk-adjusted component. The goal is to insure  5 percent of total deposits (covering the equivalent of the insured deposits of the second largest bank or the 16 smallest simultaneously). Insurance would be set at US$15,000 (higher than the 4 times per capita GDP limit under current rules), covering 99 percent of all accounts. • Bank resolution framework. The legal framework would be reviewed to permit transfers of assets and liabilities from problem to sound institutions.  15.      The staff encouraged these efforts, which address the key recommendations of the 2003 FSAP. Given the potential risks, staff urged the authorities to quickly collect information on non-bank institutions outside the superintendency’s jurisdiction. On the proposed liquidity fund, staff emphasized the need to have transparent rules and accountability in the board’s decision making and expressed some concerns with the proposal for the liquidity fund to be able to lend to the deposit insurance fund. Although this lending would be limited to about 4 percent of the fund's capital, it would mix liquidity and solvency assistance and could expose the fund (and private banks) to losses. Staff stressed the need to strengthen supervision to limit risks to both funds, particularly by providing greater legal security to supervisors. In addition, the planned merger of the central bank and the superintendency of banks should bolster the independence and technical capacity of new institution. The authorities agreed with these points. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public   13Figure 4.

Fiscal Policy The authorities aim to address serious and long standing social and infrastructure needs and tackle structural weaknesses in the fiscal area. Staff also urged them to improve spending quality and avoid actions that would increase vulnerability to a turnaround in oil prices.  Policies to improve expenditure quality 16.      In 2008, primary spending is set to increase by a further 4 percent of GDP.  Although, representing a significant fiscal impulse, the inflationary impact is projected to be modest (see para. 26). The NFPS surplus is projected to fall from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2007 to 0.8 percent in 2008 and then shift to a small deficit by 2012. Over the medium term, based on the WEO projection for oil prices and under conservative financing assumptions, there would be sufficient funds to finance the spending program. 17.      Discussions focused on ensuring expenditure quality and efficiency as well as reducing vulnerabilities. The authorities noted that they had taken important steps—with IDB support—to strengthen project evaluation and management as part of an effort to establish an effective national public investment system. In the electricity sector, they were already putting in new management in poor-performing state-owned distribution companies along with clear performance targets. A planned organic law for public enterprises would allow for significant improvement in their governance and accountability. In the oil sector, the authorities plan to contract an internationally respected consultant for a comprehensive corporate restructuring of PetroEcuador (as was done successfully with Colombia’s Ecopetrol by the same consultant); outsource the operation of mature oil fields to leading private and public oil companies; and negotiate a large IDB loan to finance modernization of plant and equipment. 18.      Staff welcomed the above measures and emphasized the importance of improving efficiency as public spending is scaled up. Experience in other countries points to the potential for public-private partnerships—with adequate safeguards to manage fiscal risks—to help ease public sector capacity bottlenecks in project execution and better leverage public funds. There is Ecuador's increase in spending over the last two years has been among the highest of oil exporting countries.Change in General Government Expenditure-3-2-101234567Tand TAngolaIranNorwayRussiaYemenUAETurkmenistanNigeriaSaudi ArabiaLibyaOmanMexicoQatarEcuadorVenezuelaKuwait(2005 to 2007; in percent of GDP)Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public   15Ecuador has one of the lowest tax ratios in the region0246810121416182022242628BrazilUruguayBoliviaArgentinaNicaraguaColombiaChileHondurasVenezuelaCosta RicaPeruEl SalvadorParaguayMexicoEcuadorGuatemalaPanamaTax ratios of Latin American CountriesIn percent of GDP; Ave. 2000-05)Source: IMF, WHD regional database.Averagealso an urgent need to improve the governance, and the administrative and technical capacity of the public banks responsible for on-lending funds to small and medium enterprises, as some have high and rapidly growing non-performing loans.  19.      The  sizable fuel subsidies are poorly-targeted and are an obstacle to achieving the authorities’ poverty reduction objectives. The authorities argued that eliminating these subsidies would also reduce the large contraband trade with neighboring countries and other serious distortions, while generating savings for higher priority programs. However, they highlighted the social and political unrest that had accompanied attempts to adjust fuel prices in the past and stressed the need to develop strategies that would minimize such risks. As a first step, they planned to make the subsidies fully transparent by explicitly including them in the 2008 budget.  Tax policy 20.      In December, the constituent assembly approved a tax law that was largely in line with proposals discussed with staff during the Article IV mission. The law includes measures with an estimated yield of about 0.6 percent of GDP, including new/higher higher excises on luxury goods; two new personal income tax brackets of 30 and 35 percent; a 70 percent windfall revenue tax for extractive industries; and a ½ percent tax on remittances abroad designed to discourage capital outflows. There is also a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code aimed at strengthening the legal power of the internal revenue in tax disputes. The authorities explained that their main objectives were to  improve equity and raise the tax ratio by 3–4 percent of GDP over the next four years, mainly through improvements in tax administration. Similar to other regional oil exporters, Ecuador has not increased gasoline prices despite the rise in oil prices... which results in a large untargeted subsidy that favors mainly the well-off.

Initiatives to improve tax administration are positive, although cross country experience suggests that the expected revenue yield might prove difficult. The staff also strongly cautioned that the tax on foreign exchange remittances abroad could discourage inflows, negatively affect depositor confidence, and undermine financial intermediation. Instead, the underlying objective of raising investment may be better served by focusing on policies that enhanced long-run macroeconomic stability, reduced vulnerabilities, and eliminated some of the disincentives for investment often cited in international competitiveness surveys (See paragraph 27 below). Underlying vulnerabilities and risks 22.      Overdependence on oil revenues, revenue earmarking rigidity, and weak expenditure management are major sources of fiscal vulnerability. They detract from fiscal sustainability, as well as from poverty alleviation and building infrastructure capacity. To tackle these problems, the authorities are preparing draft legislation to substantially reduce revenue earmarking, which would include the elimination of the various oil funds and putting all oil revenues in the budget. They are considering changes to the fiscal responsibility law that would (i) make fiscal rules apply to the actual fiscal performance and not merely to budget proposals;2 and (ii) replace existing fiscal rules with one that stipulates that recurrent spending cannot exceed non-oil revenue. They are also pressing ahead with the creation of an effective treasury single account and major improvements in central government budget and financial management systems.    Oil dependence is projected to increase in the future ...... making the public finances vulnerable to a fall in the price of oil.NFPS non-oil current primary balance012345620032005200720092011In percent of GDPNFPS primary surplus-4-20246820032005200720092011In percent of GDPBaselineWTI at US$50 23.      Staff welcomed these steps towards a strengthened fiscal policy framework. However, a much stronger commitment to restrain the growth of recurrent spending will be needed to prevent the proposed new rule from suffering the same ineffectiveness as the existing law. Institutionalizing the preparation of medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal frameworks could help to reduce the risks of procyclical and unsustainable policy decisions. Under the staff’s                                                  2 Existing fiscal rules apply only to the budget bill presented to congress not to budget execution, and contain no effective sanctions. Thus, despite rules aimed at limiting the growth of real recurrent primary spending to 3 ½ percent a year and steadily lowering the non-oil deficit, actual such spending increased by close to 80 percent in the last four years, and the non-oil deficit rose by 4 percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public   17baseline scenario, the non-oil current fiscal deficit is projected to widen and the vulnerability to a turnaround in oil prices would increase. For example, a fall in the WTI oil price to US$50 per barrel would reduce the NFPS balance by 3 percent of GDP and require a substantial fiscal adjustment to avert cash flow problems (See also the DSA Attachment V).  24.      Near-term fiscal financing needs are projected to be met comfortably, but flexibility would be increased by reducing costs and broadening the creditor base. Following suggestions early in 2007 that it would not service its global bonds, the authorities have begun to rebuild relations with official creditors and capital markets. President Correa recently stated that Ecuador would adopt a market-based approach to replace its expensive bonds with cheaper debt. A presidential commission is undertaking an audit of public external debt to determine whether any debt tranches might officially be identified as illegitimate. However, there is no timetable for its report, nor any indication how, if at all, the President would act on its recommendations. Staff welcomed the authorities’ new debt management approach and emphasized the importance of a coherent strategy to help ensure sustainable multi-year financing for the authorities’ spending priorities. Staff offered MCM technical assistance but considered that progress in restoring market creditworthiness was likely to be limited until the outcome and implications of the debt commission’s work became clearer. Intertemporal considerations 25.      Existing oil reserves have a life span of another 20 years, giving important intertemporal opportunities to spread its benefits. The authorities thought that the best way of ensuring inter-generational fairness would be to use the oil resources to fund a public investment program aimed at removing structural bottlenecks to growth, including in the oil sector. Given pressing infrastructure needs, and a low past investment program, staff shared the view that investment to upgrade Ecuador’s public infrastructure can be expected to generate large social returns. However, staff also pointed to the benefits from saving more of the oil wealth than is projected on current trends, which could help smooth spending and accelerate fiscal sustainability. Regardless of the specific policy rule chosen for this purpose, and notwithstanding significant uncertainty on key parameters, it is clear that the authorities would need to cut back on their existing spending program, e.g., with greater restraint in recurrent spending growth and elimination of untargeted fuel subsidies, to support building an appropriately-sized asset base (Box 2).

Intertemporal Considerations in Managing Ecuador’s Oil Wealth Reducing the central government’s non-oil primary deficit to a sustainable level would require a substantial adjustment from current policies. The adjustment would allow the government to start building an asset base which, by the time Ecuador’s oil reserves are exhausted in the early 2030s, would be large enough to maintain indefinitely a small primary deficit. A scenario analysis was done to examine how the non-oil primary balance would need to change to sustain two alternative policy rules into the future: a constant non-oil primary balance in real terms and in real per capita terms (both expressed in 2007 U.S. dollars). The key parameters retained for the analysis are presented in the text table, while oil prices through 2012 reflect WEO projections. In this simple fiscal framework, all government spending is treated as consumption.1  • Keeping the non-oil primary balance constant in real terms would imply a reduction in the primary non-oil deficit to US$2½ billion in 2008 and thereafter—a level that is  5½ percentage points of GDP lower than the expected 2008 outturn. As GDP keeps growing over time, the deficit-to-GDP ratio would gradually shrink from 6 percent in2008 to 1½ percent by 2050.  • The initial adjustment would be larger under a rule that takes into account population growth. The sustainable primary non-oil deficit would need to shrink to US$1½ billion in 2008—broadly consistent with the 2006 outturn. Over the longer term, the pressure to adjust further would be less than in the first scenario, with the deficit-to-GDP ratio gradually falling from 3¾ percent of GDP in 2008 to 1½ percent of GDP by 2050.  • Sensitivity analysis shows that parameter uncertainty significantly affects results, but the basic message of a substantial adjustment need compared with current policies survives.

MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS The outlook remains uncertain pending the new constitution and final decisions on key economic proposals.

With the implementation of policies outlined by the authorities and continued high oil prices, macroeconomic performance and stability can be maintained. •  Growth would start to recover in the second half of 2008. Oil output would stabilize, as higher PetroEcuador output resulting from the planned capital injections would offset some decline in foreign company output in response to the hike in the oil  windfall revenue tax to 99 percent. Non-oil growth would also pick up as the implementation of the policy package would improve business confidence and an expansionary fiscal policy would boost aggregate demand. Over time, the upgrading of infrastructure and reforms to address vulnerabilities would raise overall economic efficiency and help improve the business climate. • Inflation would rise modestly. The increase in public spending represents a significant fiscal impulse but as most is projected to go toward capital goods imports, the impact on Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public   20inflation would be low. However, to the extent that the increase in current spending is greater than projected, inflation pressures could rise significantly. • The external current account surplus would be eliminated by 2012, reflecting mainly a deterioration in the non-oil commodity prices (WEO assumption). A possible termination of trade preferences with the United States (ATPDEA) in February 2008 could hurt non-oil exports, but the effect would be attenuated by the recent reduction in import tariffs on a wide range of inputs and capital goods.  • The non-financial public sector surplus would gradually decline until eliminated by 2012, while public debt would continue to fall.  27.      The real exchange rate is expected to remain close to its equilibrium level (Figure 5 and Box 3). Notwithstanding the weakening in the current account this year, the real effective exchange rate (REER) appears to be at its estimated long run equilibrium, and non-oil exports continue to perform well, with key exports, such as flowers and shrimp continuing to gain global market share. On the other hand, non-price indicators, such as low non-oil FDI, suggest that Ecuador needs to strengthen the business environment for the non-oil sector. The projected deterioration in Ecuador’s terms of trade implies a depreciation in the equilibrium REER over the medium term. Thus, any future real depreciation of the U.S. dollar would be consistent with maintaining the REER around its equilibrium level.   28.      The main risks to the projections are on the downside. The various components of the authorities’ policy package still need to be approved by the President, and then ratified by the constituent assembly. In both cases, the probability for significant changes is non-negligible. If, instead of the policies discussed with staff, the authorities implemented alternative policies that undermined private investment and financing prospects (e.g., administrative controls on interest rates, directed lending, threats of debt default) business confidence would likely deteriorate further. In this alternative scenario (Figure 6), non-oil growth would remain sluggish, fueled only by the fiscal expansion, and lower investment would imply less oil production. With depressed revenues, the NFPS primary surplus would rapidly shift to a deficit and cash flow problems would re-emerge. If these were to jeopardize public debt service, external stability would also be threatened. In the financial system, the risk of instability would increase because of lower bank net income and eroding depositor confidence.

Ecuador: Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) Developments The undervaluation of the REER following the 1999 crisis has been fully corrected. Since 2002 the REER has been slowly but steadily depreciating owing to the weakness of the U.S. dollar against major currencies and supported by the convergence of Ecuador’s inflation rate to international levels.  The exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.   (i) Estimates of the equilibrium REER based on the behavioral equilibrium exchange rate approach (BEER) for end-2006 suggest that currently Ecuador’s REER is broadly in line with its fundamentals (seeChapter 1 of the Selected Issues paper for details). The figure on the right shows the actual and the long-run estimated REER evaluated at its long term trend values, indicating that for end-2006 the REER was broadly in equilibrium. (ii)  The conclusion of no misalignment is also supported by the results from the macroeconomic balance approach. An estimate of the equilibrium REER based on the Fund’s CGER coefficients suggests a small undervaluation for Ecuador’s REER of about 4 percent. This result is based on a computed current account “norm” of -1.3 percent of GDP for Ecuador, which is not as low as it seems once one takes into account that Ecuador’s net oil balance is substantially lower than other oil exporters. For example, the net balance to GDP for Algeria is 39 percent, for Venezuela 27 percent, and for Norway 15 percent—all significantly above Ecuador’s 9 percent.    29. Risks from a deteriorating external environment are relatively less important, unless they were to result in a sharp decline in oil prices. The markets for Ecuador’s key non-oil exports are sufficiently diverse to cushion the negative effect from a cyclical downturn in any one market. A deepening of the international financial turmoil would not be expected to have a major effect on Ecuador since the banking system is not well integrated with the global system nor is there any major financing need from international markets.  501001502002501998199920002001200220032004200520062007Ecuador: CPI-based REER (2000=100)REERNEER501001502002501960196519701975198019851990199520002005Actual REEREquilibriumEcuador: Actual and Equilibrium REER(2000=100)Exchange Rate Assessment Based on the  Macroeconomic Balance ApproachCurrent Account (in percent of GDP)EcuadorObserved 20063.6Projected M-T-0.2Estimated "Norm"-1.3Elasticity of CA to REER0.28Implied REER undervaluation-4.0%Source: Fund staff estimatesDownload Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public   24V.   STAFF APPRAISAL 30.      Favorable global conditions have supported a steady improvement in macroeconomic conditions in recent years. High oil prices and a depreciating dollar have contributed to the strongest 5-year growth period in the last quarter century. Formal dollarization has helped bring inflation down to international levels; the external current account is in surplus; and public debt has declined to a point where its size is no longer a major source of vulnerability. Last year, growth declined, in part because of business sector concerns over the direction of economic policies and uncertainty about constitutional changes that will be determined this year. 31.       The strong external environment provides a historic opportunity to tackle vulnerabilities and orient policies to deliver stronger growth and poverty-reduction. In the macroeconomic and financial area, because of dollarization there is no lender of last resort for the financial system, which also suffers from an inadequate bank resolution framework and substantially under funded deposit insurance; and the public finances are characterized by a high degree of inflexibility and a large and growing dependence on oil revenue. Overcoming these vulnerabilities, and achieving the objectives the authorities have set out (See paragraph 8), are well within the country’s reach. The staff agrees with these objectives and has offered to help the government implement them through technical assistance and policy advice.  32.      Indeed, if policies turn out largely as presented to staff during the Article IV mission, growth should recover in 2008, while external stability would be maintained. Over time, the planned upgrading of infrastructure and reforms to address financial system vulnerabilities would raise overall economic efficiency and help improve the business climate. If, on the other hand, policies undermine confidence further, for example, through administrative controls on interest rates and lending, reducing the autonomy of the supervisory agency, or defaulting on external debt, investment and growth would continue to be sluggish and risks to economic stability would rise significantly. 33.      The real exchange rate is currently estimated to be close to its equilibrium level. Moreover, any depreciation of the U.S. dollar over the medium term would be consistent with maintaining Ecuador’s REER around its equilibrium level. Other indicators, including the robust performance of non-oil exports, do not suggest any significant competitiveness problems. Overall, the formal dollarization regime has served as an important anchor for macroeconomic stability and private sector expectations in a politically and institutionally changing environment, but places a greater premium on sound fiscal and structural policies. 34.      The proposals to tackle systemic weaknesses in the financial system and reduce the high cost of bank credit are in the right direction. Plans being developed in conjunction with the IDB—to establish an augmented liquidity fund and a new credible deposit insurance scheme, and to reform the bank resolution framework—are positive. These reforms should reduce the need for high levels of self-insurance, providing banks with more room to lend at lower costs. To minimize costly use of the safety net and promote effective bank resolution, it will also be important to strengthen supervisory capacity in line with international experience. Such steps Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public   25could include ensuring the autonomy of the merged central bank and superintendency of banks and providing legal security to supervisors, and ensuring that any liquidity fund lending to the deposit insurance scheme is limited and does not put at risk the capital of private banks. 35.      Financial intermediation also needs to broaden to support higher economic growth. As other country experiences suggest, administrative measures to reduce interest rates and tax foreign exchange remittances would likely have the opposite effect, while risking confidence in financial system stability. As it is, a number of small institutions could face problems in coming months as a result of the recent abolition of loan commissions. It will be important for the authorities to proactively identify those institutions at risk, institute business adjustment plans, and promote mergers and acquisitions. In this context, it is urgent that an appropriate supervisory framework be implemented for the large number of small financial cooperatives without weakening bank supervision. 36.       The staff agrees with the objective of increasing social and infrastructure spending, but a high quality of spending needs to be ensured. Plans to upgrade the capacity of the national public investment system and introduce comprehensive reforms in PetroEcuador and some electricity generation companies are welcome. Clear progress in these areas should be seen before any significant scaling up of spending takes place. The authorities also are encouraged to explore public-private partnerships to help ease both public sector capacity bottlenecks and financing constraints, while putting in place adequate legal and  institutional frameworks to manage the fiscal risks that would arise from such arrangements. At the same time, comprehensive reforms are needed in some public banks in order for them to efficiently intermediate government funds assigned to the small and medium enterprise sector. 37.      Plans to make the costly, distortionary fuel subsidies explicit in the 2008 budget are an important step forward. It will also be important to develop a strategy and timetable for their elimination, thereby making more room for targeted spending on poverty-reduction.  38.      The increase in spending will need to avoid exacerbating fiscal vulnerabilities. Plans to improve tax administration, budget transparency, and the expenditure management system, and reduce earmarking are all positive steps. However, their overall benefit is likely to be small unless accompanied by a strong effort to restrain non-oil recurrent spending in order to reduce oil dependency and increase expenditure flexibility. In addition, there are clear risks to achieving the large expected revenue yield from improved tax administration, although the authorities are right to be ambitious in this area. Given the projected widening of the non-oil current deficit over the medium term, a substantial fiscal adjustment would be needed for the authorities to comply with their own proposed fiscal rule requiring a zero balance. In this context, it would be beneficial to institutionalize the preparation of medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal framework to reduce the risks of procyclical and unsustainable policy decisions in line with other successful international experiences. 39.      It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Ecuador take place on the standard 12-month cycle.
