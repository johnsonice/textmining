INTRODUCTION 1. The 2000 Article IV consultation discussions with Hungary were held in Budapest during November 29-December 13,200O.’ The mission met with: Governor Sur&-ryi of the National Bank of Hungary (NBH); Finance Minister Jarai; Minister of the Economy Matolcsy; senior officials in the NBH and government ministries; the Confederation of Trade Unions; representatives of financial institutions and research institutes; and the head of Parliament’s Budget Committee (a representative of the opposition). Hungary participated this year in the preparation of the Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC) modules on the financial and fiscal sectors, and on data dissemination (the Annex summarizes the findings). Hungary meets the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) specifications for data coverage, periodicity, and timeliness. 2. In concluding the 1999 Article IV consultation on March 8,2000, Directors commended the authorities for their prudent conduct of macroeconomic policies and their past record of far-reaching structural reforms. Nevertheless, they stressed that significant challenges remained-particularly as regards health care, public administration, and completion of pension reform. And in light of the relatively rigid exchange rate regime, fiscal policy would remain the cornerstone for containing domestic and external imbalances. 3. The center-right coalition government, led by Prime Minister Orban’s party, FIDESZ, is firmly focused on EU accession preparations. Since the mission, NBH Governor Suranyi’s six-year term has ended, and Finance Minister JLrai was selected as the new NBH Governor. Mr. Varga, a senior official at the Ministry, was appointed as the new Finance Minister. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for May 2002. Tensions within the coalition government could exacerbate spending pressures in the run-up to the elections. II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 4. Strong external demand boosted economic activity in 2000, allowing Hungary to post the strongest overall performance in the region and maintain its position in the vanguard among the EU accession candidates. Real GDP grew by 5.2 percent in 2000, albeit with a steady deceleration over the course of the year, from year-on-year growth of 6.5 percent in the first quarter to 4.2 percent by the fourth quarter (Tables 1 and 2, Figure 1). While domestic demand growth remained moderate, reflecting slow real wage gains, exports, spurred by western European demand in tandem with Hungary’s strong competitiveness, were the engine for growth. However, surging household credit (up by almost 50 percent ’ The staff team-Mr. Feldman (head), Ms. Wagner, Mr. Drnmmond, Mr. Vocke (all EUl), Mr. Quintyn, Mr. Karacadag (both MAE), and Ms. Winchester (assistant, PDR)-were assisted by the Regional Resident Representative, Mr. Nord.

Robust economic growth has been accompanied by signs of bottlenecks for skilled labor. Employment rose by 1.3 percent in 2000. The unemployment rate fell by 3/4 percentag e p oint to 6 percent (seasonally-adjusted) by end-2000 and was less than 3 percent in the Budapest area (Figure 2). Higher-than-expected inflation kept the gain in real wages (net of taxes) to 1.5 percent (year-average basis) in 2000. 6. Inflation has come down markedly since 1995, when the crawling band exchange regime was introduced, but recent progress with disinflation has been disappointing. Average inflation for 2000-at 9.8 percent-barely budged from the 10 percent recorded for 1999 and was well above the government’s target range of 5-7 percent (Figure 3). The reversal of the disinflation trend in mid-2000 initially reflected exogenous supply shocks- higher world oil prices, the weaker euro, and the impact of floods followed by drought on domestic agricultural output and prices. However, domestic factors have been increasingly at play through March 2001, as evidenced by an acceleration in core inflation (Box 1). 7. Over the past year, monetary policy has had to cope with the competing challenges of inflation and capital inflow pressures-in a setting complicated by the constraints imposed by the narrow exchange rate band.* Early in 2000, heavy capital inflows kept the forint at the strong edge of the band, forcing the central bank to conduct sterilized intervention at an estimated cost of about ‘/ percent of GDP in 2000 (Figure 4). The inflows tapered off after the NBH responded with a combination of deep cuts in key interest rates (over 300 basis points in the first half of the year), moral suasion, and the threat of additional capital controls. The yield curve and real interest rates had fallen to historic lows (Figure 5). 8. The loosening of the monetary stance implied by the fall in real interest rates and the depreciation of the euro against the dollar took place against a background of a rekindling of inflation, a tight labor market, and strong economic growth. The risk of fueling additional inflows prevented the use of interest rates to tackle inflation. When capital market pressures subsequently cooled and in response to an unforeseen jump in inflation in September, the NBH hiked rates by one percentage point, the first such increase since the Russia crisis. Nevertheless, structural factors (including the low degree of leverage of the household and domestic corporate sectors, and the reliance of the multinationals sector on external financing) suggest that the interest rate channel of the monetary transmission mechanism remains weak for now, implying that the rate hike would not-by itself-be able * The exchange rate band is set at ?I 2% percent around a central parity defined in terms of the euro. On April 1,2001, the monthly rate of crawl was lowered by 0.1 percentage point to 0.2 percent (an annualized rate of 2.4 percent).

Underlying Inflation Developments and Prospects The reversal in disinjlation in the second half of 2000-with headline 12-month CPI inflation rising from a low of 9percent in May 2000 to a high of 10.4 percent in November 2000, before easing to 10Spercent in March 2001-has brought to the fore concerns about the underlying causes. The NBH estimates exogenous shocks-higher world oil prices, the weakness of the euro, and the price shock in unprocessed foodstuffs-have raised the rate of headline inflation by 1 ‘/z percentage points. It also calculates that the trend of disinflation has been interrupted. This assessment relies mainly on the evolution of the central bank’s measure of core inflation, which rose even more dramatically by 4 percentage points from a low of 7 percent in June 2000 to 11 percent in March 2001 (including a surge of % percentage point in January alone), with domestic factors increasingly at play. Looking ahead, several factors will make restarting disinflation all the more challenging: 0 Productivity growth in the manufacturing sector, though edging down steadily since the first quarter of 2000, is still high by international standards and contributes to inflationary pressures through the Balassa-Samuelson effect. According to this effect, productivity gains and commensurate wage increases in the tradable sector lead to wage increases and associated upward pressure on prices in the less productive nontradable sector. In the 12 months through March 2001, prices of market services, often used as a proxy for nontradables, rose more than 8 percentage points faster than the aggregate price for industrial goods. l Rising household consumption (and associated dissaving) seems to anticipate strong future growth of wages. The sharp hikes in the minimum wage-by 57 percent in 2001 and a planned further 25 percent in 2002-may well trigger demands for further wage increases in response to the resulting compression of the wage structure. Furthermore, with the recent sharp divergence between the rate of crawl and the inflation path, the crawl rate may no longer operate as effectively as a signal to wage setters regarding inflation expectations. With the possibility of emerging nominal wage inflation inertia comes the risk of further upward pressure on inflation, and the need to head off a potential wage-price spiral. 0 The artificially low cap on regulated prices temporarily suppressed inflation in 2000, but the subsequent agreement to raise natural gas prices by 43 percent in November 2000 will add to inflationary pressures this year. l The set of variables determined to have significant statistical predictive power for CPI inflation in Hungary (see SM/99/28) suggest that the exchange rate and fiscal policy are important factors underlying inflation developments. Thus, resuming disinflation over the coming months will require the use of both policy tools. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- Figure 2.

Moreover, in the first two months of 200 1, as a preemptive measure amid signs of a pick up in capital inflows reflecting speculation of an exchange rate band widening accompanied by an appreciation of the forint, some of the tightening was unwound, with two rate cuts totaling 50 basis points-despite the steady uptrend in core inflation since mid-2000. 9. The general government deficit for 2000 was 3% percent of GDP, in line with the government’s deficit target. Estimates of the fiscal stance (including off-budget items) imply a modest withdrawal of demand stimulus (Table 3). Through November, the outturn suggested that the deficit target would be substantially undershot, owing largely to conservative budget revenue assumptions on growth and inflation. In the event, however, much higher-than-projected revenues were largely offset by higher expenditures and, in particular, a surge in spending in December. While the budget absorbed the impact of spring floods (with ministries covering these costs by restructuring expenditure), there was higher-than-budgeted expenditure on social security items, a one-time bonus to teachers and social service workers, and one-off capital transfers to the state privatization agency and the Hungarian Development Bank, in preparation for forthcoming spending on motorways. 10. External competitiveness strengthened, and the current account deficit narrowed in 2000. With industrial labor productivity-up by almost 17 percent-far outpacing real wage gains, the real effective exchange rate (ULC-based) depreciated by about 3 percent over the year compared with 1999 (Figure 6). Rising export market shares and strong corporate profitability in the export sector also support the assessment of solid competitiveness. In addition, tighter-than-budgeted fiscal policy during most of the year contributed to the improved external position (Table 4 and Figure 7). Thus, despite the significant worsening of the terms of trade,3 the external current account deficit narrowed to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2000, down from 4.4 percent a year earlier.4 11. With credit ratings approaching advanced economy levels, Hungary maintains ready access to external financing-but external debt remains high.5 Spreads on sovereign benchmark bonds are among the lowest in the region (e.g., 35 basis points over 3 The oil price shock is estimated to have contributed some US$l billion to the import bill. 4 Hungary’s external current account figures do not yet include retained earnings. If these were included, the current account deficit could perhaps be some 2-3 percentage points of GDP larger. While retained earnings have an equivalent counterpart in the external financial account-and, hence, their inclusion has no impact on the overall balance of payments-they can still represent a source of potential vulnerability. 5 In late 2000, Moody’s upgraded Hungary to A3 from Baal, while Standard & Poor’s raised its rating to A- with positive outlook.

Attracted by Hungary’s strong economic fundamentals and convergence prospects, foreign investors’ share of holdings of forint-denominated government securities reached a record high of 15 percent by end-2000. In contrast to 1999, however, when net equity inflows exceeded the current account deficit, non-debt-creating financing covered only 26 percent of last year’s narrower deficit; strong net FDI inflows were more than offset by substantial portfolio equity outflows. While net external debt, as a percent of GDP, is now almost half that in 1995 and gross external debt has fallen too over the same period, the external debt burden, with gross debt at about 60 percent of GDP, remains high. 12. Since the discussions in December, certain downside risks have become more evident. The external economic environment is now less hospitable-with regard to the degree of projected slowdowns in Europe and the United States and the intensification of the Turkish crisis (with virtually no effect on Hungary so far, but possibly raising the sensitivity of investors to political considerations). In late December 2000, surplus budget revenues went to additional spending. Recent data suggest a widening of the trade and current account deficits so far this year.6 Meanwhile, core inflation accelerated to 11 percent, year-on-year, in March 200 1. III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 13. The discussions centered on the short-term outlook and macroeconomic policy mix, and on the medium-term macroeconomic framework and structural issues. They took place against the background of prospects for a strongly expansionary fiscal stance in 2001 and 2002, reflecting the authorities’ aims of putting in place needed infiastructural improvements, spreading the gains of positive economic developments, and generally raising living standards. A key question for the short term was how to restart disinflation and keep the current account deficit in check, in the context of strong capital inflows, and whether Hungary would be better served by a different policy mix, including a more flexible exchange rate regime and a less stimulative fiscal stance. With a view to minimizing vulnerabilities and disruptions to growth, the medium-term discussion focused on fiscal policy in the context of developing a viable macroeconomic framework, including supportive structural reforms. A. Economic Outlook 14. The authorities were confident that the economy is fundamentally strong and that the current favorable setting provided an opportunity to push ahead with their 6 Despite better-than-expected external accounts data in February 200 1, the trade and current account deficits widened, respectively, by about 1 percentage point and % percentage point of GDP in January and February combined (annualized), compared with the first two months in the previous year.

Their economic framework (Table 5) projects real growth of 5 percent or more during 2001-2003. It also envisages current account deficits of between 4 and 4% percent of GDP this year and next, falling to 4 percent or less by 2003 (a sustainable level in view of projected non-debt creating financing and which would permit a gradual reduction in the net external debt ratio);7 and average inflation of 5-7 percent in 2001, declining steadily to 3-5 percent by the end of the period.* In the short term, while export growth was projected to moderate in the face of a slowdown in Europe, domestic demand, led by strong investment demand, was expected to accelerate. More generally, the authorities indicated that their objectives could be achieved, in the context of a loosening of the fiscal stance over the next two years, with: (1) further cuts in the exchange regime’s rate of crawl; (2) a concurrence of favorable exogenous shocks-particularly a sharp fall in oil prices, a stronger euro, and muted wage gains; and (3) a strong rise in gross domestic saving (on the order of 3 percentage points of GDP from 2000 to 2003). Arguments for why savings could rise include continued strong economic growth, rising per capita income, and a continued increase in corporate profits. 15. Staff saw merit in the authorities’ goals, but noted that a highly stimulative fiscal policy could exacerbate inflation and capital inflow pressures-particularly if the narrow exchange rate band were to be maintained-and result in a significant widening of the external current account deficit. Staff was concerned that the current account deficit, both in the near and medium terms, could be larger than targeted by the authorities, if the assumed strong rise in gross domestic saving did not materialize. Staff was inclined to the view that the private saving ratio would fall because of a continuation of the trend of a gradual reduction in the household saving ratio (reflecting pent-up demand and expectations of rising disposable income), a drop in the high corporate profit rate owing to some catch-up in wages in a tight labor market, and progress in financial deepening, which will reduce the impact of liquidity constraints on household consumption. With the fiscal stimulus implied by the budget and off-budget plans, at a time when domestic demand is poised to pick up, staff projected that the current account deficit would likely widen to more than 5 percent of GDP in 2001 and 2002, and external debt would increase from its already high level. Also taking into account that the modest pace of real wage gains in 2000 was, in the staffs view, 7 This is consistent with the findings in “Sustainability in the Hungarian Balance of Payments,” IMF Staff Country Report No. 99127. * In early April 200 1, in light of recent developments, the government revised its projection for average inflation for this year to 8-9 percent. Similarly, the NBH revised its projection to 8.8 percent, in the context of introducing quarterly inflation projections for 2001.

A reorientation of the policy mix to a more flexible exchange rate regime would provide greater leeway to tighten monetary conditions, while a neutral fiscal stance would avoid adding to inflationary pressures and help keep the current account in check-better positioning the authorities to meet their objectives.” B. Fiscal Policy 16. Key fiscal priorities for 2001 and 2002 are implementation of the new national development plan-the SzCchenyi Plan-and a substantial increase in living standards. This is to be accomplished in part through an almost doubling of the minimum wage in the next two years,” a sharp rise in salaries of civil servants and selected categories of public employees (e.g., in health care and higher education), and an increase in family benefits. At the same time, the ratio of expenditure to GDP-like the revenue ratio-is projected to decline, in line with the authorities’ welcome goal of reducing the overall size of government. Thus, the primary revenue ratio is slated to decline by about 3.5 percentage points to 39 percent of GDP in 2001, partly accounted for by cuts in social security contribution rates, expanded child tax credits and new tax allowances for small and medium- size enterprises (SMEs). Much of the expenditure associated with the Szechenyi Plan (Box 2) is incorporated in the deficit figures above, but some-particularly that on road construction-is off-budget spending. 17. The authorities recognized that the thrust of fiscal policy would be expansionary and indicated that they would need to keep a flexible approach to policy to achieve their inflation and external objectives. Importantly, as revenues were conservatively estimated in the budget, this included the possibility of taking advantage of any revenue over-performance to reduce the fiscal deficit. They also stated that some assistance from very positive exogenous developments may well be needed to achieve their inflation and external objectives. However, while the authorities were determined to keep the current account deficit broadly within the projected range, they felt that somewhat higher-than-targeted inflation was tolerable if broader policy aims were achieved. 9 A tightening labor market, overshooting of the government’s inflation target in 2000, and a near doubling of the minimum wage over this year and next are factors that would tend to support this outcome. Approximately 25 percent of employees had reported wages below the new minimum wage level. lo A broadly stable euro/dollar exchange rate and a decline in oil prices, consistent with the WEO, would also contribute to meeting the authorities’ objectives. l1 A substantial number of public sector employees (especially in health and education) are paid at or close to the minimum. Some social benefits are also tied to the minimum wage. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- Box 2. The SzCchenyi Plan Economic development remains widely uneven across regions despite strong economic growth in recent years. The northern regions have faced a decline in agriculture and the loss of heavy industry; in the meantime, the central and western regions have attracted most of the foreign direct investment and ;how strong industrial activity. As a result, GDP per capita in the county which includes Budapest is almost double the national average, while the unemployment rate is under 3 percent and in the counties Dordering Austria is only marginally higher. Meanwhile, the northeastern regions-in particular, the Northern Great Plains and the Northern regions-have languished, with unemployment rates in some :ounties as high as 20 percent and GDP per capita less than 70 percent of the national average. The government’s national development plan -the so-called Szechenyi Plan-aims to address these regional and sectoral disparities. Named after the 19’ century reformer, I&van Szechenyi, the plan aims ;o sustain economic growth by leveling the playing field across regions and enterprises. The Szechenyi Plan consists of programs in several areas: motorway construction, research and development, .nformation technology, housing, regional economic development, and the development of tourism as well as small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Thus, it encompasses a wide range of measures- From large spending initiatives on infrastructure (such as motorway and housing construction) to lromoting private sector development (such as equestrian tourism and linkages between SMEs and nultinationals). At its core, targeted public spending is expected to amount to Ft 296 billion in 2001 and 7t 30.8 billion in 2002 (about 2.2 percent of GDP in 2001 and 2.4 percent of GDP in 2002), with the rousing and motorway construction programs accounting for 23 and 40 percent, respectively, of the lroposed spending over both years. The Szechenyi Plan embodies important goals for economic development, but its implementation has nacroeconomic implications which deserve careful consideration: If not carefully phased in, the plan poses a risk of exacerbating demand-driven inflationary pressures in the short run. Public spending under the plan has only partly been met by a restructuring of other expenditures, resulting in a deterioration of Hungary’s envisaged budgetary position for 2001 and 2002. The domestic demand push is expected to be substantial at a time when there are warning signs that the economy is approaching capacity constraints in some regions. The plan entails government expenditure and intervention, but would be complemented by reductions in distortions that mayproduce regional disparities. The housing program, for example, aims to construct 35-40,OOO new flats a year while providing state subsidies for first-time purchasers. Focusing on reducing distortions in the housing market to improve the institutional and legislative frameworks, with a view to allowing mortgage markets to work effectively, is also important. A similar line of reasoning suggests that development of the SME sector should be supported by enhancing the banking sectors’ ability to enter the lending market for SMEs by improving the flow of information on borrowers and removing the obstacles to valuing and foreclosing on collateral. New entitlements created under the plan, such as housing subsidies, may prove difficult to reverse. This is likely to complicate the task of fiscal consolidation over the medium term by reducing the room for maneuver on discretionary expenditures.

Staff supported the authorities’ aim to include budgetary policies in the effort to more broadly distribute the benefits of Hungary’s prosperity, but cautioned that the scope of the budget effort must take into account short-term constraints. The budgets for 2001 and 2002 targeted headline fiscal deficits of 3.4 percent and 3.2 percent of GDP, respectively (Figure S), little changed from the deficit in 2000. However, while accurately gauging the stance of fiscal policy is difficult, staff estimated that fiscal policy as budgeted for 200 l-when measured on a full savings-investment basis, including off-budget spending (referred to hereafter as on an SNA basistirepresented a fiscal stimulus of more than 1% percentage points of GDP. l2 Achieving instead a broadly neutral fiscal stance (as measured by a roughly unchanged structural SNA-based primary balance relative to the previous year) would be consistent with targeting headline fiscal deficits of 3.3 percent and 2.6 percent of GDP in 200 1 and 2002, respectively, while incorporating off-budget items within these new deficit targets. l3 And moving toward a neutral fiscal stance is well within the authorities’ capacity. Measures sufficient to deliver the recommended stance include, most importantly, safeguarding revenue over-performance, in addition to targeting of social benefits, cutting the public payroll numbers, and, more broadly, keeping a firm handle on current and off-budget spending. The degree of recommended tightening is calibrated on the prospect of continued strong growth in 2001 and 2002; if growth were to slow substantially and disinflation were back on track, some loosening of the fiscal stance could be appropriate through the operation of automatic stabilizers, as long as external objectives were not seriously threatened. 19. Over the medium term, the authorities felt that further fiscal consolidation would serve Hungary well, and they have recently strengthened the formulation of fiscal policy by placing it in a multi-year context. Fiscal adjustment, however, has been backloaded relative to the government’s Joint Assessment with the EU of April 2000 (Box 3). Reflecting both the political cycle and the requirements of the Szechenyi Plan, the fiscal deficit targets for 2001 and 2002 have been eased, while the target for 2003, at 2.4 percent of GDP, is slightly tighter. These fiscal targets and the authorities’ underlying macroeconomic framework also reflect an optimistic view on private sector saving behavior. l2 At present, the government’s headline deficits conform to the GFS-86 approach to fiscal accounting and do not fully reflect all receipts and expenditures which could affect aggregate demand. Staff has attempted to adjust the fiscal statistics to capture these additional elements, in line with the recommendations of the fiscal ROSC module. Table 6 illustrates the adjustments that the staff made to the fiscal numbers to measure policy on an SNA basis. l3 These figures would correspond to deficits of 1.4 percent and 1 percent, respectively, in 2001 and 2002, using the government’s current fiscal accounting and staff estimates of off-budget items.

The Path to EU Accession The revised macroframework underlying the recent government’s budget aims at a slower pace of disinflation andfiscal consolidation than in the Joint Assessment completed last April (see table below).

Deficit (in percent of GDP) 2.5-3 2-2.8 2.5 3.4 3.2 2.4 1 Includes impact of EU transfers. Hungary is expected to present to the European Commission a fully--fledged medium-term macroeconomic program by May 1,2001, under the so-called Pre-Accession Economic Program (PEP). The PEP will include a fiscal policy framework and will serve as a precursor of the convergence program that Hungary will be required to prepare after accession. During preparation of the PEP, Hungary is expected to present deficits and debts level according to EU methodology. The PEP will be used to s ummarize and monitor implementation of the policy commitments made in earlier Joint Assessments and will be revised annually. Thefiscal impact of accession over 2000 and 2001 is estimated to be substantial. Hungary’s NPAA estimates that in 2000-2001, Ft 684 billion, or 5 percent of GDP, is going to be spent on legal, institutional and economic development to meet EU standards. Of this, some 2 percent of GDP is expected to fall on the burden of the central budget while 1.5 percent would be met by EU assistance and 1.5 percent by the private sector, NGOs and local governments. The NPAA also envisaged employment of more than 9,000 central administration staff in 2000 and 200 1 to execute tasks related to EU accession. The revenue impact of EU accession is more uncertain. Tariff cuts on accession to the common EU trade policy is expected to shrink customs revenues from 1 %I percent of GDP at present to an estimated % percent. Also, tax harmonization would reduce the VAT standard rate from 25 percent to 20 percent. But the government has indicated it would aim to achieve tax neutrality on the path of accession to the EU. The EU is expected to make a significant contribution to cover the accession costs. The Joint-Assessment envisaged pre-accession funds in the order of 200-250 million euro, on an annual average basis. Funds are expected to be available under three-programs: to assist with the implementation of the Acquis (PHARE); to support environment and transport projects (ISPA); and, for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD). Disbursement of pre-accession funds is generally conditional on available co-financing from own budget resources. Transfers would rise from 0.2 percent of GDP in 1999 to some % percent of GDP in 2000-01, making a significant contribution to covering accession costs. Following accession, it has been estimated that Hungary would pay about 400-500 million euro, but receive about 2.5-3.1 billion euro per annum-from the Common Agricultural Policy, Structural Fund, and Cohesion Fund-giving a net potential inflow of 2-2.7 billion euro, or 4% to 6% percent of current GDP.

Thus, the elements of an alternative macroeconomic framework (Table 7), based on more conservative saving assumptions, were discussed, drawing on the methodology of the accompanying Board paper on medium-term fiscal frameworks. With a view to keeping the external current account deficit to 4 percent of GDP or less, this scenario envisages a tighter fiscal stance-a primary surplus of about 1 ‘/z percent of GDP in 2003 on an SNA basis, corresponding to a headline deficit of about 2 percent of GDP, but including off-budget items.r4 Assuming a more flexible monetary policy (see below), the scenario would be consistent with a fall in inflation from almost 10 percent in 2000 to about 4 percent in 2003. Invigorating structural fiscal reform now would help to ensure the viability of the fiscal path over the medium (and longer) term. The authorities agreed that structural reform was important, but viewed the staffs medium-term scenario as unduly risk averse, though they concurred that there was uncertainty about the private saving-investment balance. Structural Expenditure Reforms and Fiscal Transparency 20. The current economic upswing provides an ideal opportunity to push ahead with remaining and urgent structural fiscal reforms. The discussions focused on plans and progress in four key areas. But, at this stage in the political cycle, the authorities did not deem it likely that concrete actions would be taken soon. l On health care reform, the OECD estimates that, absent reforms, the deficit of the health care system could increase seven-fold by mid-century (Box 4). Thus, while the authorities noted that health care reform is especially difficult and politically charged, it is urgently needed to reduce future contingent liabilities. The authorities were developing a framework to place the health care sector on a sustainable path. Indeed, the relatively short life expectancy of the Hungarian population and the tight caps on health care spending argue for increased efforts to initiate reforms. The authorities also emphasized that needed repairs and improvements to infrastructure (especially hospitals) would entail higher expenditures initially, although some of this may be offset by efficiency gains attained through reforms in the provision of pharmaceuticals and the delivery of health care services generally. l Pension reform, initiated in 1997, attempted to address medium-term demographic pressures, principally by establishing a second private pillar. The share of pension contributions directed toward this pillar remains at 6 percent, notwithstanding original plans to raise it to 8 percent by 2000. The authorities, while conscious that raising the share of contributions transferred to the private pillar does not affect the fiscal l4 While the authorities’ target for the headline deficit is 2.4 percent of GDP, the staffs figure of 2 percent represents a much tighter fiscal stance because it incorporates items (of almost 2 percentage points of GDP) that are treated off-budget in the authorities’ target.

Agingpopulationspose a serious fiscal risk over the longer term for many OECD countries, and Hungary is no exception. Hungary has a fertility rate well below replacement level, leading to a simultaneous shrinking and aging of the population, with the proportion of persons age 65 or older projected to more than double by mid-century. However, the aging problem is somewhat less severe than that of some of the other OECD countries, because of the relatively short life expectancy of the Hungarian population. Rising costs in the social security system-exacerbated by an increasing dependency ratio-pose the greatest threat to long-term fiscal stability. However, the demographic time-bomb will not fully hit for another two decades, allowing the government time to enact forward-looking reforms to limit the long-run fiscal impact. Indeed, the 1997 pension reform (a move to a two-pillar system, an increase in the retirement age, and a shift in the indexing system from one based on wages to one that uses a weighted average of wages and inflation) was designed to address this future contingent liability. But completion of the reform has stalled, with the contribution rate to the second pillar currently capped at 6 percent, 2 percentage points less than planned. Moreover, a higher-than-anticipated percentage of older workers opted for the new two-tier system. Both of these developments increase the probability that the government’s Pension Guarantee Fund’ will have to be tapped in the future, and the longer the delay in raising the contribution rate to 8 percent, the greater the risks of triggering the guarantee. Among the most seriousflscal strains will be those imposed by the health care system, if major structural reforms are not implemented. According to an OECD study, the deficit of the health care system could reach 5.7 percent of GDP by 2050, up from the current 0.8 percent of GDP. But the government is already struggling to contain health care expenditures, particularly those related to pharmaceuticals subsidies. In addition, hospitals are running up large debts, doctors survive on “gratuity’ payments, and low pay is leading to a nursing shortage. Thus, reform of the health care system is of immediate urgency, including limiting the range of core health services paid by the state, targeting pharmaceuticals subsidization to the most needy, promoting the use of private insurance for broader coverage, expanding the range of co-payments for health services, enhancing the gatekeeper function, and, more broadly, educating the population to take greater responsibility for their health. But the above reform measures are not enough to avoid futurejiscalpressures from social security shortfalls. Even assuming completion of the pension reform (and ignoring potential payouts from the Guarantee Fund), the OECD estimates that the pension-related revenue shortfall could reach 2% percent of GDP by mid-century. Addressing the low labor force participation rates, particularly with respect to older workers’ and the minority Roma population, would help to forestall the coming demographic crunch. In this connection, consideration should be given to increasing the statutory retirement age to 65 and to sharply limiting the use of disability payments to support early retirement. More fully integrating the Roma population into the labor force-through education and by reducing work disincentives inherent in the social security system-would also help to mitigate the impact of the sharp declines in the working age population over the next several decades. ’ The Pension Guarantee Fund is used to guarantee a minimum second pillar benefit and is financed through membership fees (equal to 0.3 to 0.5 percent of contributions), but is ultimately backed by the central budget. * According to the OECD, employment rates for those between 55 and 64 are 29.7 percent and 11.3 percent for men and- women, respectively, compared with OECD averages of 60.8 percent and 37.6 percent.

Staff urged the authorities to move ahead with the increase in the transfer rate so as to reduce the probability of having to tap into the Pension Guarantee Fund in the future (Box 4) and of undermining financial market sentiment. The authorities are considering an increase in the contribution rate, perhaps by 2003. 0 On local government financing, the authorities recognize that it is essential to put in place improved mechanisms and approaches to maintain fiscal control and to ensure the potential benefits of decentralization. As more fully described in the accompanying Selected Issues paper, the system of local governments in Hungary has a lower degree of fiscal autonomy and devolution than other systems in more advanced European economies. As Hungary moves in the direction of greater autonomy and devolution, there may be scope for the central government to rely less on intergovernmental transfers and more on the revenue-raising powers of local governments. More widespread cooperation among local governments and regional units could also help to reduce the cost of services and lock in economies of scale. a On public sector employment, the authorities noted that health, education, and general administration were overstaffed. Against the background of the targeted rise of nominal wages in the public sector in 2001 (and, indeed, if the government hopes to retain highly qualified staff, higher government wages would seem appropriate), the authorities recognized the need to step up efforts to rationalize public sector employment, but admitted it was difficult in the next two years to move forward with their goal of reducing the public payroll by about 2 percentage points per year over the medium term. 21. Hungary has advanced a long way towards more transparent and comprehensive fiscal accounts, but the renewed growth of off-budget or quasi-fiscal liabilities should be avoided if the trend toward increased transparency is not to be interrupted. The main risk is a build-up of off-budget liabilities in the implementation of the lo-year motorway construction plan. The authorities are committed to moving the fiscal accounts onto an ESA-95 basis, which should help facilitate policy decisions by providing a more accurate picture of the fiscal stance.” In this context, the authorities are reviewing the accounts of APV Rt., the state privatization agency, with a view to bringing its fiscal activities fully into the central government budget. Building on their fiscal transparency self-assessment completed in 2000, a fiscal ROSC module was prepared in March 2001. The overall assessment was positive, but the report highlighted the need for a more l5 Beginning in April 2001, the authorities will be submitting a six-monthly fiscal notification compiled on an ESA-95 basis to the EU institutions.

C. The Monetary Framework and the Exchange Rate Regime 22. There was broad agreement between the staff and the authorities that the narrow band exchange regime has been instrumental in supporting Hungary’s economic successes. It has provided an anchor for inflation expectations, avoided excessive exchange rate variability, and ensured firm discipline over macroeconomic policies. And the monetary authorities’ success in defending the forint at the peak of the Russia crisis only further enhanced the regime’s credibility. 23. With the limited room for maneuver for monetary policy, however, both the monetary authorities and the government share the goal of widening the exchange rate band-but so far there has not been a decision on the timing. During the second half of 2000-in a setting characterized by the absence of heavy inflows, the forint trading on the strong side of the band, and a healthy current account position-a widening of the band was under consideration, as the authorities recognized that a more flexible exchange regime would provide more scope for monetary policy to react to inflationary developments. The authorities also viewed an eventual widening of the band as a strategy for preparing for ERM-II participation. But a predominating concern was that an early widening- accompanied by a likely appreciation and before inflation reached a sufficiently low level (of about 4-5 percent)16+ould derail export-led growth by eroding Hungary’s competitiveness. A particular worry in this context was the potentially adverse impact on the domestic SME sector and the tensions that could arise against the background of a highly profitable multinational sector. As a result, a widening of the band has been postponed. 24. Staff indicated its strong support for a move to a more flexible exchange regime. Indeed, calm market conditions (described above), such as at the time of the discussions, provide a good opportunity, and staff argued for an early move. Staff suggested several advantages to increased exchange rate flexibility in Hungary’s current setting: it would raise the exchange risk premium, discourage unhedged borrowing by corporations, and allow the NBH more leeway to respond to demand pressures (particularly in view of the relatively loose monetary conditions). It would also help to reduce the probability of a resumption of strong interest-rate sensitive capital flows by eliminating “risk-free” arbitrage opportunities. As discussed more fully in 13 1, the required regulatory and prudential controls should also be in place at the same time. l6 This corresponds to the inflation rate estimated by the NBH at which the difference with average EU inflation would be about that implied by productivity differentials. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - 25. The authorities reviewed the options for anchoring monetary policy in the event of a move to a more flexible regime. One obvious possibility would be direct inflation targeting. While the authorities agreed that inflation objectives were central to monetary policy, they had serious concerns, at this stage, about adopting a full-fledged inflation targeting framework. In their view, direct inflation targeting would be difficult to effectively implement, as there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the inflation transmission mechanism-particularly through the interest rate channel. They were also apprehensive about how inflation targeting had worked in other countries in the region. While Hungary’s track record of central bank autonomy, practice of publishing inflation reports, and highly skilled staff provide good administrative structure for inflation targeting, they expressed a preference for a strong role for the exchange rate. 26. The authorities’ preferred strategy would be to retain a “soft” inner band- under normal market conditions-within a wider band. Operationally, using a soft inner band as an intermediate target has advantages in view of the uncertainties regarding the interest rate transmission mechanism-and the related concerns expressed by the NBH about unduly focusing on interest rates in a full-fledged inflation targeting framework. At the same time, the authorities’ strategy would allow for some interest rate flexibility while mitigating the risks associated with a hard narrow band. While departures of the rate from the soft band would generally be expected to elicit policy responses to move the rate back into the narrow band, a change in fundamentals would merit a shift in the inner band.17 In view of the success the authorities have had in the past with their approach, staff had sympathy for these views, agreeing that the exchange rate was important for determining inflation expectations and for meeting inflation objectives. But it would be critical that any inner band not be adhered to rigidly to avoid the “guarantee” of the current regime that had, at times, induced heavy speculative inflows. In this context, allowing the forint to breach the inner band under heavy market pressures would drive home the point, without loss of credibility, that the currency is not tightly constrained. Staff felt that a tightening of the monetary stance was needed, including through a moderate appreciation of the exchange rate, if inflation objectives were to be within reach.‘* l7 A wide band---of&l 5 percent as proposed by the authorities-could accommodate these kinds of shifts. ‘* “Wage-Price Dynamics in Hungary,” SM/99/28, empirically investigates the magnitude and timing of nominal exchange rate effects on inflation in Hungary. Roughly speaking, an appreciation on the order of 5-7 percent could be expected to lower the price level by about 3 ‘/z percent. Moreover, the analysis indicates a rapid passthrough of nominal exchange rate changes to both inflation and nominal wages, suggesting that an exchange rate-based disinflation may not pose a major risk of a sustained appreciation to the real effective exchange rate. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - 27. With a more flexible regime, the forint could be allowed to appreciate moderately, providing an initial impetus toward resuming disinflation. In the staffs view, shared by some officials, a moderate nominal appreciation would be unlikely to pose a threat to Hungary’s strong competitive position. Much of the export growth is attributable to the multinationals, which appear well placed to withstand some appreciation of the currency. Profitability of the multinationals has been quite high compared to international norms, implying that large profit margins could absorb some of the costs of an appreciation, and the import content of their exports is substantial, muting some of the impact on profits. In addition, the SME sector is now better positioned to deal with a modest appreciation, in light of its increasingly solid competitiveness both on the domestic market and in non-EU export markets. Box 5 provides further evidence of Hungary’s strong competitiveness. At all events, irrespective of the exchange rate regime, monetary policy cannot, by itself, tackle both inflation and a current account deterioration-support from fiscal policy is crucial. D. Financial System Stability and External Vulnerability 28. Staff welcomed Hungary’s participation in the pilot project of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). In view of the narrow band exchange regime, the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) of the financial system’s resilience was particularly important. Indeed, as discussed in Box 6, the FSSA was favorable, finding that, at the macro, banking, and corporate levels, the Hungarian financial system is stable and likely to withstand most potential systemic shocks. But there is still room for improvement, most notably, pertaining to the regulatory and supervisory framework (e.g., the need for full implementation of consolidated reporting and supervision and for further enhancement of supervisory autonomy) and the legal basis for finance (including the collateral and foreclosure proceedings). The authorities generally agreed with the FSSA. As stressed by the authorities, they are addressing most of the remaining weaknesses with pending legislation. Significantly, the NBH recently launched the publication of a semi-annual Report on Financial Stability, a major step forward in the continuous monitoring of macroprudential risks, and the FSSA benefited greatly from the report’s insights and analysis. 29. Overall, the FSSA finds that Hungary has the financial capacity to cope with foreseeable external shocks, and the risk of serious contagion from financial crises abroad appears limited-a relevant finding in the wake of the crisis in Turkey. The indicators in Table 8 suggest that the level of international reserve cover (in terms of imports, short-term debt, or reserve money) is broadly adequate, although a higher level of reserves may well be desirable with a pegged regime. The most recent upgrade of Hungarian debt to investment grade also separates Hungarian bonds from the broader asset class of emerging market debt and could help reduce the associated risk of contagion. Indeed, the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey in 2000 had only a minimal impact on financial markets in Hungary, although the more recent flare-up of tensions in Turkey mildly dampened foreign investor interest in Hungary’s fixed income market.

External Competitiveness in Hungary ’ Hungary’s export competitiveness is strong, as evidenced by real export growth rates in the double digits since 1997 and a rapidly increasing share of Hungarian exports in the total imports of its main trading partners. In 2000, Hungary’s real export growth rate reached 2 1 percent. The share of Hungarian exports in total EU imports has increased rapidly from 0.41 percent in 1993 to 0.89 percent in 1999 to equal the share of much bigger Poland (Figure 6).* Export growth has been particularly strong in the machinery and transport equipment sector. The share of this sector in total Hungarian exports increased from 36 percent in 1996 to 60 percent in 2000, and this sector alone accounted for 79 percent of the total increase in Hungarian exports between 1996 and 2000 in value terms. Favorable real exchange rate developments in recent years have contributed to Hungary’s strong external competitiveness. Since the introduction of the current exchange rate band at end-l 994, the Hungarian real effective exchange rate (REER) based on consumer prices appreciated by only 4 percent through the second quarter of 2000, despite a significant contribution of the Balassa-Samuelson effect to inflation in Hungary (estimated by the NBH at 1.9 percent per year over the period from 199 1 to 1998). This compares with appreciations of 32 percent in Poland and 15 percent in the Czech Republic, but a 3 percent depreciation in Slovenia (Figure 9). The Hungarian REER based on available data for wholesale prices in manufacttning also shows a rather moderate appreciation of 6 percent between 1995 and 1999. The strength of Hungary’s external competitiveness is even more evident from indicators related to unit labor costs (ULC). Labor productivity in industry increased by 130 percent in Hungary since 1993, as compared to 110 percent in Poland, and 65 percent in both Slovenia and the Czech Republic. These productivity gains have taken place largely without labor shedding, as unemployment in Hungary has fallen from more than 11 percent in 1993 to less than 6 percent, a level that would be regarded as enviable in much of the EU. At the same time, Hungary’s moderate real wage gains contributed to its having the lowest gross monthly U.S. dollar wages in industry of the four CEE countries compared above. Moreover, Hungary’s ULC-based REER depreciated by 26 percent between the first quarter of 1995 and the second quarter of 2000, while it depreciated by only 6 percent in Poland and 2 percent in Slovenia and appreciated by 9 percent in the Czech Republic. Large profit margins-in particular in sectors with significant foreign ownership-provide yet another indication for Hungary’s competitiveness. Hungary has attracted the highest stock of FDI per capita in the region (about 2,000 U.S. dollars), much in the form of greenfield investment, and firms with significant foreign ownership account for more than three quarters of all Hungarian exports. These investments have been highly profitable and there is ample room from large profit margins to absorb some appreciation of the exchange rate. In view of the high penetration of multinationals in the Hungarian economy, Hungary has, in this respect, more in common with Ireland than with other CEE countries. Flexible labor markets, that have supplied skilled labor at low costs for technologically advanced production, have been a main factor behind strong export performance in both countries. Broader-based assessments of competitiveness confirm the judgment about Hungary’s competitiveness. The 2000 World Competitiveness Report placed Hungary ahead of Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Poland as well as some EU members, in its overall competitiveness ranking. This ranking takes into account a broad range of indicators-such as, for example, the value-added produced, the cost of living, the degree of economic openness, the cost of capital, intellectual property, labor costs, labor force characteristics, and educational structures-grouped in eight different areas. Hungary’s business environment was ranked first in the region for the period 1996-2000 in a recent study on FDI by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and is expected to keep the leading position for the period 2001-05. According to the EIU, Hungary’s ranking is a reflection of the extensive supply-side reforms undertaken during the past ten years, which are reflected in most aspects of the business environment. ’ See also the accompanying Selected Issues paper on external competitiveness. ’ In 1999,75 percent of all Hungarian exports went to EU countries. Despite a slowdown in EU import demand growth from 9.3 percent in 1998 to 6.4 percent in 1999, Hungary’s exports proved resilient, posting a substantial growth of 13 percent in real terms, while real export growth was in the single digits or negative for most of the other regional economies.

Financial Sector Stability Assessment-Main Conclusions Hungaty has been at the forefront offinancial sector reform among the transition economies and has one of the most developedflnancial systems in Central and Eastern Europe. The financial system is characterized by high foreign ownership across subsectors, which serves as a stabilizing factor. Ownership by reputable foreign banks enhances the loss-absorption capacity of the system and reduces the risk of systemic distress and contagion in a cyclical downturn or in the event of an internal or external shock. At the same time, however, it exposes the sector to structural and institutional changes in global banking that are beyond Hungary’s control. Thefinancial sector now contains a broad set of institutions, markets, and instruments that have been successful in building resilience-as was demonstrated during the real-life stress test of the 1998 Russian financial crisis, from which the financial system emerged relatively unscathed. Nevertheless, vigilance remains important in the face of potential macroeconomic challenges, lingering vulnerabilities in the financial system, and remaining weaknesses in the regulatory and supervisory framework. The Hungarian financial system is well capitalized and managed, but some potential risks lie ahead. Capital adequacy ratios are well above 8 percent and classified loans are under 3 percent of total loans. However, sector profitability is low, owing in part to narrow spreads driven down by intense competition, particularly in lending to large creditworthy companies. As a result, financial institutions have been increasingly expanding into risky markets-SMEs, consumer loans-to reverse depressed earnings and to gain market share. Stress tests of credit, interest and exchange rate risks underpin the assessment of overall resilience of the financial system, but nevertheless point at vulnerabilities in certain banks, in particular in terms of credit risks, reflecting vastly different risk management capacities and systems among individual banks. This, in conjunction with the low profit margins, indicates that further consolidation of the sector would be desirable. The structure offinancial intermediation is changing rapidly with the growth of non-bankfinancial institutions-which have expanded at double the rate of banks in recent years-and the development of capital markets. These sectors do not pose a systemic threat to the financial system. However, the tendency towards the formation of large financial groups in Hungary highlights the importance of a rapid implementation of consolidated prudential supervision, to ensure that a complete picture of the risk exposure of the groups becomes available. In early 2000, the Hungarian authorities moved to a untfted supervisory agency (the Hungarian Financial Supervisory AuthoriFHFSA), combining the existing sectoral supervisory agencies. The integration was considered the best response to the evolution in the financial system toward large conglomerates. The unification, in conjunction with adoption of the principles of consolidated reporting and supervision in the recently amended banking act, puts the agency in an excellent position to gain complete insights to the risk exposure of these groups. Establishing the new supervisory structure has also led to a higher degree of autonomy, compared to the individual predecessors, but further progress should be made. A unified structure could help to overcome regulatory and supervisory gaps in the markets, and it provides a better forum to reach harmonization in rules, regulations and supervisory practices across sectors. Work is underway to reap these benefits of the unification. Hungary has made considerable progress in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial system, bringing the framework closer to international standards and practices. The current round of revisions is intended to harmonize regulations with the EU Directives. The assessment of the regulatory and supervisory framework for banking, securities markets and insurance sector indicated growing compliance with the standards set forth by the international rule-setting bodies (see annex). In this context, the following areas, affecting all sectors of the ftnancial system, deserve further strengthening: better regulatory backing for the supervisors to instill and enforce principles of corporate governance; a move away corn checklist-driven on-site inspections, to truly risk-based inspections, to fully stay in touch with market developments; providing the power to the supervisory agency to issue binding regulations to be able to respond quickly to market developments; better defined enforcement powers for supervisors; and, specifically for the banking industry, a clearer definition of large exposure limits and powers to force non-complying banks back into the limits.

Nevertheless, as a small, open economy exposed to large capital flows, Hungary remains vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment. For this reason, the authorities continue to maintain some controls on capital, with the goal of limiting “hot money” and speculation against the forint. Over the past year, some of the controls on outflows were loosened, including those related to medium- and long-term lending abroad in foreign exchange and the purchase by residents of foreign open-end funds. Staff welcomed these moves as this should help lessen, to some degree, pressures from capital inflows. 31. But the authorities clearly recognize that a careful sequencing of capital account liberalization must go hand-in-hand with a move to a more flexible exchange regime. Premature abolition of the remaining capital controls, prior to increased exchange rate flexibility, could increase Hungary’s exposure to destabilizing capital flows. When the band is widened, however-in order to foster the development of more liquid and deeper hedging markets needed in an environment of less exchange rate predictability-the authorities shared the staffs view that it would be necessary to dismantle the remaining controls on short-term flows and to ensure that the required regulatory and prudential controls, such as appropriate trading book regulations, are in place. lg The authorities plan to complete the liberalization of cross-border flows by end-2002, in line with OECD and EU directives on free movement of capital, with those controls which most affect monetary stability to be removed last.*’ Market participants have interpreted this as implying that the exchange rate band will have been widened by this time. 32. With respect to domestic risk factors, there has been a surge in credit growth and an associated increase in credit risk exposure of the banking sector and their affiliates in 2000. The authorities and staff agreed that this development is a natural part of the transition to a mature financial system and, as such, is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, while direct risk exposure follows from the growth in lending activity in general, the notable increase in lending to new, more risky sectors (such as small and medium-size enterprises and households)-+ven though from a low base-underscores the increased exposure to risk. Thus, from a financial sector stability point of view, it is welcome that the supervisory authorities recognize that these developments require close monitoring and that they must remain vigilant in enforcing the relevant prudential limits, classification and provisioning rules, and banks’ capital adequacy ratios (at 13.5 percent on an aggregate basis as of September 2000). 33. Credit risks have also grown because of increasing foreign exchange exposure of banks’ clients. While banks’ direct foreign exchange exposure remains within the allowable lg A government decree on trading book regulation was put into effect on April 1,200 1. *’ Among those measures seen as most affecting monetary stability would be the opening up of the short-term treasury bill market to foreigners and allowing them to take up forint loans.

The authorities admit there is no hard evidence as to the size of such unhedged borrowing, but anecdotal evidence suggests that much of the borrowing is naturally hedged. Nevertheless, staff encouraged the authorities to regularly monitor the nonfinancial sector’s external exposure to assess the potential for credit and systemic risk due to unhedged borrowing. Banks can also be affected by the foreign currency exposure of their own affiliates. As long as consolidated reporting is not mandatory, this represents a gray area of activity which requires close monitoring. E. EU Accession and Other Structural Reforms 34. The government is targeting completion of EU accession preparations by end-2002. The Nice conference provided a clear signal of the EU’s intentions regarding enlargement and established a clear road map to guide accession countries in their preparations, enhancing the prospects for early entrance. Hungary received a broadly positive assessment in the EC’s 2000 Regular Report and hopes to close most of the outstanding harmonization chapters with the EU this year, ahead of the mid-2002 deadline set by the EU. 35. At the beginning of 2001, Hungary took an important step towards full integration with the EU, with the lifting of tariff restrictions on trade in manufactured goods with the EU and CEFTA. Import quotas (on trade with WTO members) on some consumer products were abolished at the same time. In particular, the global quota, with the exception of an open quota for fish products, was abolished with the EU as of January 1, 2001. Significant steps were also taken, beginning in July 2000, in liberalizing agricultural trade with the EU. From January 1,2001, the tariff on industrial products from the EU, CEFTA, and other countries with which Hungary has a free trade agreement (i.e., Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) is zero. For industrial products coming from other countries, the average tariff is 6-8 percent in 200 1, down by l-2 percentage points from 2000. On agricultural products, the average tariff in 2001 is 30 percent, compared with 33 percent in 2000. 21 The current reporting/monitoring framework provides the NBH with daily reports from banks with a detailed breakdown of assets and liabilities in foreign exchange, typically with a l-2 day lag. The foreign exchange liabilities are broken down by maturity between those above and below one year. The reports show stock positions, but not flows or future drains on foreign exchange. Hence, these reports do not allow the NBH to observe a shortening of maturities within the under one-year category, nor do they allow it to know how much is falling due on a given day within the next week, for example, should circumstances warrant this kind of information. However, the NBH has the legal power to require banks to provide such information, should it wish to. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - 36. On labor market policies, the authorities felt that the near doubling of the minimum wage by 2002 would distribute the benefits of the strong economy and should have only a minimal effect on inflation and domestic demand. In their view, the higher minimum wage in many sectors would serve to raise tax revenues by reducing the extent to which incomes can be underdeclared as a tax avoidance measure. And lowering employers’ social security contributions should help offset the impact on enterprises. But, at more than 40 percent of the average wage, Hungary’s minimum wage is now among the highest in relative terms in the region. In this context, it makes sense to monitor its possible impact, in particular, on wage compression and associated pressures on wages at higher levels, and on structural unemployment among the less skilled or in fragile sectors, such as textiles and agriculture,22 and on the more depressed regions. Consideration should also be given to allowing exemptions from the minimum wage for youths, depressed regions, and industries. Meanwhile, the authorities are making an effort to increase the labor market’s flexibility through steps such as reducing the duration of unemployment benefits to encourage rapid resumption of work. 37. The authorities have increasingly resorted to market intervention, such as price caps, in their efforts to curb inflation and to protect low income families. In 2000, the authorities capped price increases in regulated sectors, such as for gas, electricity, and pharmaceuticals, sometimes below costs. In 200 1, the authorities again intend to limit retail price increases for electricity and gas to 6 percent, in line with the inflation target. This approach can send a negative signal to foreign investors, with financial market participants having increasingly expressed concerns about greater political intervention in the economy. A suppression of price adjustment can also lead to a build-up of latent price pressures, which will come to the fore at a later date. Applying sharply differentiated prices across the corporate and household sectors introduces unnecessary price distortions. Targeted subsidies could be a better way of protecting the neediest households, although the scope of the subsidies would need to be limited, which the authorities noted could be difficult. 38. Privatization is largely completed, but a number of significant assets remain in state ownership, including in the agricultural, banking, chemicals, communications, real estate, and transport sectors. OTP, the largest and a domestically-owned bank, was given the exclusive right to make an offer for purchasing the renationalized Postabank, the last fully-owned state bank. However, the offered price was deemed too low by the government, which is now reexamining its options, including the possibility of retaining the bank under state ownership. 22 Multinationals, on the other hand, are likely to only benefit from these changes, since they usually pay well above the minimum wage, but will see lowered costs due to the reduction in social security contributions.

A track record of far-reaching institutional and structural reforms and careful macroeconomic management has enabled Hungary to leave largely behind the challenges of transition and rightly concentrate on spreading the benefits of prosperity. Indeed, Hungary remains among the frontrunners for EU accession, and most of the challenges now facing Hungary are those confronted by many of the EU and other advanced economies. Moreover, economic performance has been among the strongest in the region, and the country has weathered the recent emerging market crises well. 40. But not all of the economic news has been positive of late. Inflation remains stalled above 10 percent, with core inflation continuing on an upward trend, and the data for the last several months, taken together, indicate a deterioration in the external accounts. Yet real interest rates hover near record lows, constrained by the narrow band exchange regime, and fiscal policy is set to provide a substantial boost to an already strong economy. This raises the specter of greater vulnerabilities at a time when government intervention in the economy has increased. 41. The challenge now is to pursue a policy mix that encourages sustainable growth by restarting the disinflation process and keeping the current account in check. Monetary policy cannot in isolation address the rise in inflation, nor can it be expected to simultaneously preserve the external position. Indeed, whatever the form of exchange regime chosen, a tighter fiscal policy needs to play a key role in addressing these challenges and ensuring the viability of the monetary framework, all the more so in the circumstances of a cyclical upswing. However, the expansionary fiscal stance implied by the budget and planned off-budget spending could jeopardize the economy’s successes to date. 42. The balance of risks would argue for ensuring a broadly neutral fiscal stance in 2001 and 2002, which would require significant fiscal tightening relative to the budget and current off-budget spending plans. Achieving a neutral stance could be accomplished by actions that include safeguarding revenue over-performance and scaling back current and off-budget expenditure (including cuts in public employment and means-testing of social benefits). This, along with a moderate exchange rate appreciation and a tightening of the monetary stance, would support the attainment of the authorities’ inflation objectives. Absent unanticipated adverse shocks, the envisaged fiscal tightening should also be consistent with the authorities’ external objectives-though fiscal policy would need to react if external current account developments were to become significantly less favorable. In addition, while the goals of the Szechenyi Plan are important, the economy would best be served by phasing it in carefully, paying due regard to macroeconomic vulnerabilities and constraints. 43. The narrow crawling exchange rate band has undoubtedly contributed to Hungary’s successes, but-to underpin financial stability and to provide support to the disinflation effort-there is considerable merit in moving soon to a more flexible regime. By discouraging speculation and unhedged borrowing, a more flexible regime Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - would underpin the stability of the financial system. It would also be instrumental in supporting the central bank’s efforts in pursuing its inflation objectives by providing greater leeway to tighten monetary conditions. A moderate appreciation in this context would provide an initial impetus toward resuming disinflation, avoiding the risk that inflation could settle in at 10 percent or more and raise the costs of disinflation, while complicating the approach to ERM-II. A moderate appreciation should not derail the fundamentally strong export performance, in light of Hungary’s solid external competitiveness. Nevertheless, because an appreciation would in all likelihood result in a widening of the current account deficit, the move to a wide band would underscore the urgency of fiscal adjustment. Fundamentally, there is no easy answer to the dilemma of the exchange regime choice in the face of a highly stimulative fiscal stance. But without a rebalancing of the policy mix, the current account deficit could move into unwelcome territory. 44. Fiscal policy over the medium term, supported by structural reform, should strive to contribute to smooth convergence and set the path for sustainable and strong growth. Fiscal consolidation, backed by structural reforms, would increase policy flexibility and improve the economy’s resilience. It would also help ensure external sustainability, so necessary for durable growth. Pressing ahead with the remaining structural reform agenda would set the stage for this virtuous circle. Cornerstones of this effort will be reforms to pensions, health care, local government financing, and public administration-and reforming these areas will be challenging. Completing pension reform and addressing reform of the health care system are paramount for staving off adverse effects of a forthcoming demographic shock. Reform of local government financing would ensure adequate fiscal discipline and efficient delivery of services. On public administration, higher government wages, as currently planned, should help to retain highly qualified staff, but, at the same time, strong efforts should be made to rationalize public sector employment. 45. The size of the minimum wage hike this year and next poses risks. It could jeopardize employment in struggling sectors. The government therefore needs to remain alert to such developments and may wish to consider allowing exemptions from the minimum wage for youths, depressed regions, and industries, as in some EU member countries. The sharp minimum wage increase could also generate higher wage demands across a broader spectrum due to wage scale compression, which could add to inflationary pressures and boost imports at a time when external demand is slowing down. Thus, next year’s planned minimum wage increase may need to be reconsidered. 46. Continuing with its impressive performance in transitioning to a market economy over the last decade, the government should press ahead with a few remaining steps. The economy would benefit from proceeding transparently with the remaining program of privatization as rapidly as possible. In their efforts to curb inflation, the authorities should avoid ad hoc caps on regulated prices. 47. Hungary’s participation this year in the pilot project of the FSAP has provided an excellent starting point for an ongoing assessment of financial stability and external Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 35 - vulnerabilities. Importantly, the authorities have followed up with the launching of the NBH’s Report on Financial Stability, to be issued semi-annually. This report, unique among the EU accession countries, is a welcome and transparent approach to addressing and monitoring issues on financial sector stability. 48. The FSSA found that the financial system was basically sound and resilient, but further reforms are still needed in several crucial areas. As Hungary has been at the forefront of financial sector reform among the accession countries and has one of the most developed financial systems in the region, the Hungarian authorities are to be commended for their achievements. To strengthen the financial system, in the context of Hungary’s integrating in the global financial markets at an accelerated pace, the main priority should be to have a regulatory and supervisory framework in place that stays abreast of the risks associated with new developments in products and markets. One of the most critical needs at this juncture is to fully implement consolidated reporting and supervision of financial groups. And the authorities should press forward with their plans to increase the autonomy of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Agency, which is essential to ensure a timely response to any nascent financial market risks. 49. Building on the past successes with respect to transparency and standards initiatives, Hungary has taken significant additional steps in these areas since the last Article IV consultation. Hungary’s participation in the pilot FSAP project and in the preparation of the financial sector, fiscal, and data dissemination ROSC modules provides further evidence of Hungary’s strong commitment to transparency and standards, and staff would welcome their decision to publish the ROSCs and the Staff Report. As discussed in the fiscal ROSC, there are some areas where transparency could be improved; these include the conduct of significant fiscal activities outside the purview of the Ministry of Finance and the practice of allowing the government, without Parliamentary approval, to spend higher-than-forecast revenues through government resolution. 50. Hungary’s statistics are adequate for surveillance. With respect to the SDDS, Hungary fully meets the specifications for data coverage, periodicity, and timeliness. The recent ROSC module concluded that the quality of Hungary’s data is generally sound. Areas for improvement include proceeding with plans to place the balance of payments data onto a full accrual basis and providing more complete coverage in the fiscal accounts, with a view to enabling a more accurate calibration of the fiscal stance. The authorities are to be commended for their commitment to this goal and their efforts to date. 51. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The HFSA thus now covers banking, securities, insurance and pension funds supervision. One common issue that emerged in all original assessments-and was reassessed after the establishment of the HFSA-was the degree of independence of the supervisory authorities. The legal framework establishing the HFSA enhanced some elements of the autonomy. The president is now appointed by Parliament for a fixed term. In addition, the agency issued a clear mission statement. However, further improvements in the degree of autonomy, as revealed throughout all assessments, would be desirable. They relate to (i) a clear definition of the accountability of the president of the HFSA; (ii) budgetary autonomy- lack thereof may give rise to the possibility of political intervention; and (iii) the lack of regulatory powers, which may limit the ability of the supervisor to address, through new rules and regulation, evolving risks in a timely manner. Other common issues identified in all assessments relate to the need for stronger enforcement powers for the supervisors and stronger regulations to instill corporate governance principles in the supervised institutions. Base1 Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision The assessment indicates that the regulatory framework for banking supervision is largely compliant with the Core Principles. The Banking Act of 1997 represented an important effort in adopting international best practices, and additional staffing and training improved the supervisory function. When the amended law-enacted in early 200 l-will be implemented, the legal framework will close the gap with international standards further. This is in particular the case with respect to the crucial powers to require reporting on a consolidated basis and to conduct consolidated supervision. Some other areas remain, even after the new amendments, less than fully compliant and need to be addressed as they may present risks to the soundness of the Hungarian financial system. These include (i) the need for more comprehensive requirements for risk management ; (ii) more rigorous rules on connected lending ; (iii) stronger focus and supporting rules addressing the nature and quality of board governance and oversight; and (iv) the need for effective remedial actions that can be used flexibly. In addition, the authorities should further strive to strengthen and deepend the supervisory practice. International Organization of Securities Commissions’ (IOSCO) Objectives and Principles Securities markets regulation conforms in most material respects with the above. The assessment identified the following outstanding issues: (i) the limited level of oversight autonomy given to the Self Regulatory Organizations; (ii) the inadequacy of enforcement regulations; and (iii) the absence of capital requirements for risk exposure. Planned legal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - ANNEX initiatives intend to address several of these issues. With respect to the supervisory function, there is a perception in the market that compliance with accounting and auditing standards is low, and that enforcement by the supervisors of these standards is not strong enough. More generally, the perception exists that the enforcement efforts of both the supervisory agency (more specifically the HFSA’s predecessor) and the SROs have proven to be inadequate and that the disciplinary program conducted by the supervisors is too lenient in imposing sanctions. International Association of Insurance Supervisors’ (IAIS) Standards The review of compliance indicates that Hungary is in full or material compliance with most of the principles, but improvements in some areas are recommended. A new law, currently under preparation, aims to complete the alignment to EU standards. Offsite surveillance and onsite inspections in the insurance sector are well developed, and supervisors have extensive intervention powers. The two main areas in need of improvement are the powers for supervisors to instill corporate governance principles in insurance companies and to require the establishment of internal controls of derivative positions. Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems The systemically important payment and settlement systems comply in most aspects with the above principles. In VIBER, the real time gross settlement system, the NBH is exposed to a credit risk due to the present weak legal provisions on pledges. The only issues surrounding the other payment system (the Interbank Giro System-a system for the clearing and settlement of third party credit transfers), as well as KELER (the Central Clearing House and Depository (Budapest) Ltd) are the uncertainty in the bankruptcy law and associated laws regarding multilateral settlement and collateral arrangements for risk management. These arrangements are not sound and are therefore in need of strengthening. Code on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies Observance of the IMF’s Code on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies by the National Bank of Hungary (NBH), the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (HFSA) and the National Deposit Insurance Fund (NDIF) is high. Areas for further improvement include (i) the openness of the formulation and reporting of monetary policy decisions. The NBH’s press releases are short and as a rule do not explain the reasons for policy changes. Also, meetings of the NBH’s council-its primary monetary policy decision-making body- are not announced in advance and there is no predetermined number of meetings per year; and (ii) more clarity with respect to the NBH’s oversight role in the payments system. The HFSA’s policies are also, and have been improving since its inception in April 2000, with the publication of a mission statement, the extension of its announcements on the website, and planned interactions with the press on recent policies. A shortcoming relates to the publication of its balance sheet, which is part of the government budget. The NDIF’s policies and operations are fully observant of the principles laid down in the Code.

Hungary has made significant progress in increasing the transparency and accountability of government in recent years and meets many of the requirements of the Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency. Some areas remain where fiscal transparency could be improved. The government should ensure that all government spending is authorized either in the budget or, if necessary, by passage of a supplementary budget by the parliament and end the current practice of authorizing some spending (either by government decree or spending ministeries) without a parliamentary vote. The central government should present (in the budget and in fiscal statistics) a consolidated picture that includes the activities of the State Holding and Privatization Company, the National Road Construction Company, and ‘nonprofit’ institutions that conduct essentially fiscal activities. Consideration should also be given to restructuring the arrangements between the budget and the State Holding and Privatization Company to bring its fiscal activities fully into the central government budget, with the same treasury and internal audit controls as all other budget institutions. The government should also prepare comprehensive reports on quasi-fiscal activities, on the financial assets of the government, and on tax expenditures. Consideration should be given to moving towards performance or output- oriented budgeting that would include specifying the government’s budget objectives in terms of outcome targets, reporting on selected indicators of budget outcomes, and developing the ability to conduct performance audits. Finally, the government should ensure that the current rules for public procurement are more strictly adhered to at all levels of government. (III) Data Dissemination and Quality ROSC Module The assessment finds that Hungary meets the SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of all data categories, and for the dissemination of advance release calendars. In most cases the Hungarian agencies have a legal and institutional framework that supports statistical quality, and they demonstrate an awareness of quality as the cornerstone of statistical work. All agencies demonstrate professionalism, are transparent in their practices and policies, and provide ethical guidelines to their staffs. Accuracy and reliability could be improved in a few data categories by strengthening of source data and statistical techniques. In general, the statistical data compiled in the five sectoral areas meet users’ needs although users may have some difficulty in reconciling some statistical aggregates that are common across datasets. Accessibility of data and metadata is high, and assistance to data users is of high quality. The methodological frameworks generally follow intemationally- endorsed standards. However, in the area of the fiscal accounts, the structure departs from standard presentations by including certain financing items above rather than below the line, and the coverage excludes several institutions from the definition of government which are normally included.

Until March 13, 1995, the value of the peg to the basket was adjusted periodically, mainly on the basis of the difference between domestic and foreign inflation rates; since then, the value of the peg is adjusted in accordance with a preannounced rate of crawl. Between March 13 and June 30, 1995, the rate of devaluation against the basket was 1.9 percent per month; it was reduced to 1.3 percent per month as of July 1, 1995; to 1.2 percent per month as of January 1, 1996; to 1.1 percent per month from April 1, 1997; to 1 .O percent per month as of August 15, 1997; to 0.9 percent per month from Jan 1, 1998, to 0.8 percent per month from June 15, 1998; to 0.7 percent per month from October 1, 1998; to 0.6 percent per month from January 1, 1999; to 0.5 percent per month from July 1, 1999; to 0.4 percent per month from October 1, 1999; to 0.3 percent as of April 1,200O; and to 0.2 percent as of April 1,200 1.

Significant progress has been made in improving the timeliness, coverage, periodicity, and quality of Hungarian statistics, but some shortcomings remain. For example, the detailed annual national accounts data are available only after a long lag (published at end-September after the reference year). 2. Hungary has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) on the Internet. Hungary fully meets the SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of advance release calendars. In 2000, Hungary’s national summary data page was hyperlinked to the DSBB, and the authorities complied with the strengthened reserves standard disseminating the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity. A. Real Sector Issues National accounts 3. The authorities began to publish quarterly figures for GDP and its components beginning with the first quarter of 1996. Beginning in 2000, the quarterly figures were integrated into the annual national accounts data, so that consistent time series are now available for the most important GDP aggregates (production and use) since 1995. The quarterly publication now covers both volume indices and value data. Other real sector issues 4. The authorities have improved the reliability of industrial sales data by broadening the sample of enterprises surveyed. In addition, a new methodology for seasonal adjustment was introduced in 1997. Retail sales data are increasingly incomplete in coverage because they do not adequately reflect the rapid growth of new enterprises and unincorporated businesses in this sector. B. Balance of Payments 5. The Statistics Department of the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) compiles the balance of payments and international investment position of Hungary using essentially methodology in accordance with the Balance ofPayments Manual, Fifth edition (BPA45). Hungary’s balance of payments (BOP) statistics are recorded on a settlement basis, compiled from transactions reported by (1) credit institutions; (2) enterprises that report on a monthly basis on their direct borrowing/lending activity from/to non-residents; (3) enterprises, that report on a monthly basis on their stock of overall assets and liabilities held outside of resident banking sector against non-residents, and on cumulated transactions and other changes affecting these positions; (4) exchange offices that report on a monthly basis on their cumulated turnover and cash holdings. As a supplementary source, quarterly reports by FDI Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5l- APPENDIX II companies, resident direct investors, security traders and Central Clearinghouse and Depository (Budapest) Ltd. (KELER) are also used for compilation purposes. 6. Processing and repairs of goods are recorded as services(value added) in the BOP, instead of recording the gross value of exports and imports under goods as recommended in the BMP.5. As a result, discrepancies exist between trade data recorded on a settlements basis and customs data, which records the physical movement of goods across borders. This gap between the two sets of series has recently widened. The reasons for this discrepancy are currently being reviewed by the National Bank of Hungary. Despite these differences, both the balance of payments and customs data point to a dramatic improvement in the external accounts since March 1995. The authorities have indicated their intention to use the customs data as a primary source for compiling goods in the BOP, but preparations in this regard have been delayed repeatedly. 7. While resident institutional units are in accord with the BPMs’s definition of center of economic interest, the exclusion of reinvested earnings and other transactions that have no payment counterpart or banking mediation, limits the scope of BOP statistics in their coverage of all resident-nonresident transactions. Transactions are recorded on a cash basis, rather than on the accrual-based accounting principles of BPMS. With respect to the treatment of reinvested earnings, the current account deficit is understated by, perhaps, as much as 2-3 percent of GDP. Since reinvested earnings are also excluded from the financial account, however, there is no net impact on the balance of payments-though the exclusion contributes to the statistical discrepancy in the savings-investment balance. C. Monetary Sector 8. The IFS country page for Hungary now provides in principle timely data for the monetary authorities, banking institutions, and the banking survey. IFS for March 2001 shows a reporting lag of three months (last data received on December 19,200O for September 2000). In addition, the coverage of the National Bank of Hungary’s analytical accounts has been extended, and Hungary now complies with the strengthened reserves standard. STA conducted a money and banking statistics mission in October 2000 to review progress in this area and to discuss recent methodological changes in the compilation of monetary statistics. The STA mission found that the framework for the compilation of monetary statistics in Hungary basically conforms to the Fund’s current methodology. But at present, the treatment of nonprofit institutions--currently shown as part of general government-deviates from the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) guidelines on sectorization, and there is a slight difference with respect to content of the household sector as well. With the gradual implementation of the 1995 ESA and the statistical framework of the European Monetary Union as from early 200 1, the definition, sectorization, and classification of monetary accounts will fully correspond to the guidelines of the MFSM.

The degree of decentralization of fiscal institutions hinders the full consolidation of government accounts, thereby leading to lags in availability of the data, possible overstatement of the size -of the government in the economy, and complicating the estimation of the national accounts. 10. Significant progress in addressing several of these issues has been made with the establishment and subsequent expansion of the centralized Treasury and improved compilation of statistics at the Ministry of Finance. In 1996, its first year of operation, the social security funds and central budgetary institutions were integrated into the Treasury accounts, thereby enabling full monitoring and control of all disbursements and commitments of these entities. Annual data on a functional basis was published in 1999. Plans to report monthly expenditures classified on an economic basis have not yet come to fruition. Following a GFS mission in 1998, the authorities provided annual data for 1991-97 that were published in the 1998 GFS Yearbook. These data, and the monthly data reported for IFS, contain inconsistencies between the measures of the deficit and financing. The GFS Yearbook data, therefore, contain significant adjustments to financing. 11. Financing data provided for IFS are not published because of the significant differences between financing and the deficit. The Ministry of Finance, in cooperation with the Treasury and the Debt Management Office, is working to identify and eliminate these inconsistencies.

Hungary joined the World Bank in 1982. Since then the Bank has committed about $4.0 billion for 40 projects and programs. During the 1980s Bank assistance focussed on liberalization of the economy and modernizing and expanding its productive capacity (particularly in industry and agriculture) and in&&ructure (transport, energy, and telecommunications). During the 1990s support for macroeconomic and structural adjustment during the transition became a key element of the assistance program, with four loans totaling close to $1 .O billion, including two Structural Adjustment Loans, accompanied by Japan Exim co-financing and an JMF EFF Program, in the early 199Os, and sector adjustment loans supporting financial sector and pension reform in the mid-1990s. This was accompanied by support for strengthening public institutions (e.g. in tax administration and public finance, health and social assistance). 2. The last Country Assistance Strategy (December 1997) had as main objectives to help Hungary to sustain economic growth and support its efforts to join the European Union. The focus of the assistance program was on helping Hungary finalize the public sector reforms initiated in the mid-90s (pension, health, municipal development), strengthen institutions and markets in key EU-related sectors, enhance social cohesion and protect the environment. Recent lending includes support for higher education and youth training, pension reform, and, most recently in 1999, for municipal waste water, in collaboration with the EU. Currently six projects are under implementation, including operations in higher education and vocational training, municipal services (transport and wastewater), and public finance management and energy sector reform, with remaining undisbursed loan amounts of $173 million as of March 15,200 1. With the steady improvement in the current account of the balance of payments and in Hungary’s access to private capital, Bank lending has been limited in recent years, and Hungary has cancelled part of undisbursed loans and pre-paid some outstanding obligations. Hungary’s outstanding obligations to the Bank amounted to $58 1 million as of February 28,200l. IFC and MlGA have not undertaken new investments and guarantees in Hungary in recent years, and IFC’s outstanding portfolio is now $33 million, while MIGA has no exposure at present. 3. The ongoing Bank assistance program focuses on implementation of ongoing projects and on advisory and analytical support in key selected areas, related to the EU accession process (e.g. sub-national development and energy) and to poverty reduction (with a poverty assessment and an assessment of Roma support programs recently completed). Possible new Bank financial support is expected to be limited to environment, in conjunction with the Global Environmental Fund (GEF), and possibly sub-national development on the basis of the technical and analytical work that is now underway in close collaboration with the Government of Hungary.

Real GDP grew by 5.2 percent in 2000. While exports were the engine for growth, domestic demand growth remained moderate, reflecting slow real wage growth. Robust economic growth has been accompanied by signs of bottlenecks for skilled labor. Employment rose by 1.3 percent in 2000. The unemployment rate fell by % percentage point to 6 percent (seasonally-adjusted) by end-2000 and was less than 3 percent in the Budapest area. Higher-than-expected inflation kept the gain in real net wages to 1.5 percent (year average) in 2000. Inflation has come down markedly since 1995, when the crawling band exchange regime was introduced, but recent progress with disinflation has been disappointing. Average inflation for 2000-at 9.8 percent-barely budged from the 10 percent recorded for 1999 and was well above the government’s target range of 5-7 percent. The reversal of the disinflation trend in mid-2000 initially reflected exogenous supply shocks-including higher world oil prices and the weaker euro. However, domestic factors have been increasingly at play more recently, as evidenced by the rise in core inflation. Over the past year, monetary policy has had to cope with the competing challenges of inflationary and capital inflow pressures. Early in 2000, heavy capital inflows kept the forint at the strong edge of its narrow band, forcing the central bank to cut interest rates. By mid-2000, l Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the May 4, 2001 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

This loosening of the monetary stance occurred against a background of a rekindling of inflation, a tight labor market, and strong economic growth. When capital market pressures subsequently cooled and in response to an unforeseen jump in inflation in September, the National Bank of Hungary hiked rates by one percentage point. But, in the first two months of 2001, amid signs of a pick up in capital inflows, some of the tightening was unwound, with two rate cuts totalling 50 basis points-despite the steady uptrend in core inflation since mid-2000. The general government deficit for 2000 came in at 3% percent of GDP, in line with the government’s deficit target. Through November, the outturn suggested that the deficit target would be substantially undershot, but, in December, the much higher-than-projected revenues were largely offset by higher expenditures, particularly on social security items and capital transfers to the state privatization agency and the Hungarian Development Bank. External competitiveness remained strong, with the external current account deficit narrowing in 2000. Industrial labor productivity-up by almost 17 percent in 2000-far outpaced real wage gains, leading to a depreciation in the real effective exchange rate (ULC-based) over the year. Rising export market shares and strong corporate profitability in the export sector also support the assessment of solid competitiveness. During most of the year, export growth exceeded that for imports, tourism revenues boosted the services account, and fiscal policy was tighter-than- budgeted, contributing to an improved external position. Thus, despite the worsening of the terms of trade, the external current account deficit narrowed to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2000, down from 4.4 percent a year earlier. However, the trade deficit in the latter part of the year was ‘unexpectedly high, as import growth accelerated on the back of a sharp pick-up in investment. With credit ratings approaching advanced economy levels, Hungary maintains ready access to external financing-but external debt levels remain high. Spreads on sovereign benchmark bonds are among the lowest in the region, and, attracted by Hungary’s strong economic fundamentals and convergence prospects, foreign investors’ share of holdings of forint-denominated government securities reached record highs in 2001. In contrast to 1999, strong net FDI inflows were more than offset by substantial portfolio equity outflows. While net external debt, as a percent of GDP, is now almost half that in 1995 and gross external debt has fallen over the same period, external debt, at about 60 percent of GDP on a gross basis, remains high.
