Discussions for the first review under the second annual arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and for the 2000 Article IV consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic were held in Bishkek from May 9-24 and July 24-August 2. The staff team’ met with the President, Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, the Chairman of the National Bank (NBKR), other senior officials, and representatives of the private sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 3, 1999. At that time, Directors commended the authorities for the strong policy actions adopted to bring the program under the PRGF back on track following the Russian crisis. They agreed that fiscal policy should play a larger role in further containing domestic demand, and expressed concern about the slowdown of the reform momentum in some structural areas, especially privatization and the modemization of the legal and regulatory framework. 2. The second annual arrangement under the PRGF in support of the authorities’ macroeconomic and structural adjustment program for 2000 was approved on February 9, 2000, and a disbursement of SDR 4.77 million was made.2 Discussions on the first review in May could not be concluded because the authorities needed more time to bring the program back on track (see below). 3. As reported in EBS/OO/l 1, the Kyrgyz Republic misreported reserves because they did not inform the Fund in a timely manner that some reserves were pledged as guarantees on external loans. At the Board meeting on February 9,200O it was agreed that sufficient remedial action had been taken. Since then international experts have completed two audits of the reserves which have confirmed the assessment. Furthermore, the authorities have ’ Consisting of Mr. Trines (head), Ms. Khazai (May), Ms. Kozack, Mr. York, Ms. Bernhardt (Assistant)(all EU2), Mr. Keller (July) and Mr. Konuki (both FAD). Mr. Zaidi, the Fund’s resident representative in Bishkek, assisted the mission. Mr. Odling-Smee visited Bishkek during May 17-18. Mr, Cippa, Executive Director, joined the mission from May 21-24, and Mr. Szczuka, Alternate Executive Director, from July 3 l-August 2. 2 EBS/OO/l 1,01/27/00 and Supplement 1,02/08/00. The three-year arrangement under the PRGF in an amount equivalent to SDR 64.5 million (72.6 percent of quota) was approved on June 26,1998 (EBS/98/95). The arrangement was augmented by an equivalent of SDR 8.88 million (10 percent of quota) at the time of the mid-term review on March 3, 1999. To date SDR 35.15 million (39.6 percent of quota) has been disbursed under the three-year arrangement.

In the attached letter (Attachment 1) the authorities request completion of the first and second (midterm) review under the arrangement and the second and third disbursements (SDR 4.77 million each (5.4 percent of quota)) related to these reviews. The authorities are requesting the necessary waivers. 5. As of end-June 2000, the Kyrgyz Republic’s outstanding use of resources amounted to SDR 139.82 million (157.5 percent of quota), consisting of SDR 122.35 million under the PRGF and SDR 17.47 million under the STF (Appendix I). Extensive technical assistance has been provided by the Fund (Appendix I) and by other multilateral agencies and bilateral donors. Operations of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the Kyrgyz Republic are described in Appendixes II and III. The authorities have been regularly providing the core minimum data to the Fund, while considerable efforts have been and are being made to further improve the quality, timeliness, and coverage of statistical information (Appendix IV). The Kyrgyz Republic has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, and maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. II. RECENTDEVELOPMENTSANDPERFORMANCEUNDERTHEPROGRAM" 6. Although economic growth improved somewhat, 1999 was a difficult year for the Kyrgyz Republic. Inflation increased sharply as a result of monetary slippages and other factors, revenues declined and the fiscal deficit grew, both exports and imports slumped- although the current account deficit improved-and structural reforms slowed in some areas. Despite the adoption of an adjustment program for 2000, problems continued in the first quarter of 2000 and several performance criteria under the program were not observed, which was one of the factors why the first program review could not be completed in May. Subsequently, the authorities renewed their efforts; nonetheless, three performance criteria for end-June were not observed (Table 1). 7. Real GDP growth in 1999 picked up to about 3% percent, despite the lingering effects of the 1998 Russian crisis and trade difficulties with neighboring countries, mainly on account of buoyant growth in agriculture (Table 2 and Figure 1). For the first half of 2000 growth is estimated at about 7.4 percent (compared to the same period the previous year), substantially higher than earlier projected., again mostly on account of agriculture but with positive signs in almost all sectors. 3 BUFF/00/48 states that items l-3 are required for program reviews after September 30, 2000. 4 Developments in 1999 and the first half of 2000 are described in more detail in the accompanying issues paper and in EBS/l l/O0 (01/27/00).

Inflation in 1999 jumped to 40 percent (end-of-period), mainly due to large increases in prices of grain and flour early in the year,5 liquidity injections in April and July, and a significant depreciation of the som during the year. However, tight monetary policy in the second half of the year and into 2000 helped reduce inflation subsequently. For the first 6 months of 2000 cumulative inflation was 7.1 percent, the lowest level for that period since 1990, and substantially lower than projected. 9. According to official figures, the unemployment rate declined slightly in 1999 to just under 3 percent. However, estimates of unemployment taking into account unregistered jobless ranged widely from about 7 to 20 percent and showed an increase. Average real wages fell by close to 10 percent compared to 1998. Preliminary data on poverty indicate that a large share of the population continues to live below the poverty level; 64 percent of the population could be considered poor in 1999, of which 23 percent are extremely poor.6 10. The general government deficit increased from about 9% percent of GDP on a cash basis in 1998 to about 12 percent in 1999, on account of a revenue decline (Table 3 and Figure 2), and a significant increase in the foreign-financed public investment program (PIP). At the same time, the primary balance (excluding the foreign financed PIP) improved from a deficit of just over 1 l/z to a surplus of about L/2 percent of GDP. Tax revenue collection weakened, especially in the first half of 1999, due to lower imports of taxable goods, weakness in the non-agricultural economy and recurrent tax administration problems.7 To keep the overall deficit under control, current expenditures were slashed by more than 2 percent of GDP, despite unexpected outlays related to security problems in the south of the country in mid-year. However, total expenditures increased by about 2 percent of GDP, due to an increase in externally financed capital expenditures, mostly on account of a few large projects, including the renovation of the Bishkek-Osh road and Manas airport. The domestic budgetary arrears which had accrued at the central level in 1998 and in the first half of 1999 were eliminated. At the same time, external debt service arrears accrued and reached about $26 million at the end of 1999.8 5 To settle gas arrears with Uzbekistan grain reserves were exhausted, which led to a panic in the grain market and a surge in grain prices (by 40-50 percent). 6 For more details see section VI in the issues paper. ’ While overall economic growth was higher than expected this was due to buoyant agriculture which is exempt from virtually all taxation. ’ Mostly owed to Russia ($21 million) and Pakistan ($3 million). In January 2000 an agreement was reached on the rescheduling of the 1999 arrears to Russia. The agreement was signed in June.

The fiscal situation remained difficult in the first quarter of 2000 and the end- March performance criteria on cash tax revenues and budgetary arrears were not observed. However, revenue performance improved substantially in May and June and the performance criterion on cash revenue for end-June 2000 was observed. Nevertheless, customs revenues remained weak throughout the period. Overall expenditures were contained and the budget deficit target for end-March (a performance criterion) was observed. In the second quarter this compression of current expenditures was not enough to compensate for higher expenditures related to the PIP and the budget deficit target for end- June was exceeded by about 0.2 percent of (estimated) annual GDP.’ Between January and June, new external debt service arrears, mostly owed to Russia and Pakistan ($19 million) accrued while negotiations on debt rescheduling were ongoing. Domestic arrears accumulated in the first quarter were eliminated by end-June. However, the Social Fund was not able to maintain zero pension arrears (a performance criterion) as programmed; arrears amounted to som 95 million at end-March and som 46 million at end-June. 12. Monetary policy in 1999 was greatly influenced by the crisis in the banking sector and by the government’s decision in mid-year to settle most budgetary arrears. As a result, base and broad money growth was uneven during the year; for the year as a whole, base and broad money grew by 23 percent and 34 percent, respectively (Tables 4 and 5 and Figure 3). Monetary policy was tightened substantially in the first few months of 2000 and base and broad money both grew by only 5 percent between end-December 1999 and end-June 2000. All monetary performance criteria for end-March and end-June were observed. Interest rates on bank credit and treasury bills similarly fluctuated during 1999, before starting to fall in the first quarter of 2000: by July interest rates on short-term borrowing by the government had dropped below 20 percent, with rates on bank credit similarly coming down, although more slowly. Real deposit rates were negative for most of 1999, but have been positive in 2000. 13. The banking sector experienced a severe crisis in 1999, brought on both by the after-effects of the Russian crisis and governance problems. Several banks, including some of the country’s largest, were closed in early 1999 and although some measures were implemented to improve the situation, overall progress was slow, contributing to a further dollarization of the economy.‘o On several occasions the NBKR injected liquidity, but the amounts were limited. In early 2000 a comprehensive bank restructuring plan, developed with assistance from MAR, was adopted and a number of measures were put in place, including closure of one additional large bank, and recapitalization (by its owners) of another. ’ Five projects accounted for about 75 percent of the capital expenditures. lo A detailed description of the problems in the banking system and the steps that have been and will be taken to resolve them is provided in section VIII of the accompanying issues paper.

These developments contributed to a depreciation of the som against the U.S. dollar of about 35 percent in dollar terms during 1999, despite intervention by the NBKR.” The pace of depreciation slowed significantly in the second half of the year and in early 2000. At end-June, the exchange rate was about som 47 per U.S. dollar, compared to som 46 per U.S. dollar at end-1999. At the same time, the real effective exchange rate remained more or less unchanged during 1999 and the first quarter of 2000, after a large depreciation following the Russian crisis, suggesting that the Kyrgyz Republic has not lost international competitiveness (Figure 4). Average monthly wages in dollar terms fell from a level of about $27 in 1998 to $25 in 1999, which is among the lowest of the Baltics, Russia, and other countries of the former Soviet Union (BRO). 15. The overall balance of payments position of the country improved and the current account deficit, although still large, declined from about 20 percent of GDP in 1998 to 16 percent in 1999 (Table 6 and Figure 5) and the NBKR increased its gross reserves by $53 million (1 month of import cover). Exports to traditional partner countries suffered a one third decline, due to trade tensions with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and the difficult economic situation in Russia, but this was compensated for by an even larger drop in imports from most partner countries. As a result, both the trade and current account balances showed a marked improvement over 1998. The capital account surplus declined due to a sharp fall in foreign direct investment. I2 Preliminary indications are that exports and imports in the first half of 2000 were below the levels in the same period in 1999, but that there was a small trade surplus. Within the context of the country’s WTO obligations, the average statutory import tariff was reduced to about 5 percent starting in January 2000. 16. With the depreciation of the som, the drop in exports, and new borrowing, external debt indicators worsened. The stock of public and publicly guaranteed debt increased to $1.4 billion13 at end-l 999 or 112 percent of GDP. In net present value (NPV) terms, the ratio increased from 51 to 65 percent. The ratio of debt to exports (in NPV terms) remained around 13 1 percent. More than 50 percent of the debt is owed to multilateral organizations, the largest creditors being the World Bank, the ADB, and the Fund. 17. Some structural reforms advanced in 1999 and early 2000, including pension reform, amendments to legislation to allow private ownership of land, and launching a tender for the privatization of Kyrgyz Telecom. A detailed plan for the restructuring of the ‘I Expectations of a large depreciation, following the introduction of a floating exchange rate in Kazakhstan, also played a role. I2 Inflows of direct investment exceeded $100 million in 1999, but for unknown reasons investment outflows increased. Thus foreign direct investment on a net basis was only $44 million.

Reforms of the health sector are ongoing. Two of the structural performance criteria for end-March and end-June 2000 were observed, as were most of the structural benchmarks, albeit some with delays (Table 9). The structural performance criterion on business licensing for end-June was not met; sublicensing has been eliminated, but some of the amendments to licensing procedures are awaiting approval of amendments to the law on licensing. Progress was slow in privatizing large state enterprises,15 enterprise restructuring, and application of the enhanced legal and regulatory framework, and in April 2000 two presidential decrees were issued that opened the way for increased state control in the agricultural sector, provided subsidized loans, and introduced tax deferrals.

In light of the underperformance at end-March, and because there was considerable uncertainty whether it would be possible to bring the program back on track by end-June (both because of weak revenue performance in April and external arrears), the first review could not be brought to the Board as scheduled. In the event, the authorities have made progress in bringing the program back on track, including rescheduling of external arrears. The improved macroeconomic situation also played a role. While expressing strong commitment to the continued implementation of the PRGF program and achievement of the program’s overall objectives, the authorities requested some modification in the fiscal area, as explained below. Against this background, the mission’s discussions focused on steps to keep the program on track, the general outlook for the remainder of the year, and medium- term prospects. The policy environment remains uncertain given that presidential elections will be held later this year. Although some important policy initiatives have recently been taken (e.g., in the energy sector), others are being delayed until after the election (e.g., further public administration reform). 19. Based on the experience thus far in 2000, output growth is expected to be better than programmed for the year. Agriculture remains buoyant and there are positive signs in other sectors, including industry. With a continued tight monetary policy and a relatively stable exchange rate, annual inflation should fall well below 20 percent, despite price increases for oil and gasoline. I4 An increase of 20 percent on January 1,200O and 35 percent on April 1, although the latter was subsequently rolled back by 15 percentage points in May. ” Despite the tender for the privatization of Kyrgyz Telecom, no progress was made in actually selling the company, probably partly due to the high minimum asking price.

The authorities shared the concerns of the mission about the weak revenue performance in the first 4 months of the year. However, they pointed to the strong recovery in May and June and were confident that, with the somewhat better economic performance and revenues generated by the taxation of sales from free economic zones to the domestic market, revenues for the year would be very close to the original targets. They did not believe the improved revenue performance was temporary, but to help assure this by September they will increase license fees for sales of alcohol and raise the patent (i.e. presumptive) tax on certain profitable activities such as casinos, restaurants, etc. They also noted that measures had been taken to expand coverage of the patent tax on small businesses. Furthermore, the share of offsets in revenues has been kept below 6 percent of total revenue this year which has enhanced flexibility in budgetary operations. 21. The mission welcomed the recent improvement in revenue collections, but expressed disappointment that the revisions to the tax code envisaged under the program (inclusion of excises, customs and other duties in the VAT base, and an increase in the retail sales tax rate) had been rejected by the new parliament and that the proposed increase in land tax rates had been withdrawn due to political pressure. Given the still fragile fiscal situation and the heavy debt service burden, the revenue base needs to be further expanded, including in the agricultural sector, which accounts for a large share of GDP but contributes little to revenues. The authorities noted that they would resubmit the proposed changes to the retail tax and the VAT for parliamentary consideration in September. They also noted that they would continue to work with parliament to adopt these changes and raise revenues in relation to GDP. Nevertheless, prospects remain uncertain. In any case, the mission noted that these or equivalent revenue raising measures, would need to be in place for any follow up program. 22. The mission underscored the need to continue the improvement of tax and customs administration and welcomed the additional steps the authorities are implementing, including the enforcement of repayments of budgetary loans and proposed changes to the system of penalties to discourage tax avoidance. In the customs area, an FAD advisor has prepared a work program and there will also be technical assistance from the World Bank, and strong efforts will be made to reduce smuggling. 23. The mission welcomed the steps to further improve expenditure control, in particular the recent introduction of a warrant system, to help avoid the accumulation of budgetary arrears. The authorities felt that they had been successful in containing expenditures and would continue to do so if revenues did not improve. All budgetary arrears accumulated in the first quarter at the central level had been eliminated and progress was also being made at the local level. 24. The authorities acknowledged that problems still existed with regard to the foreign- financed PIP, which had led to the non-observance of the end-June performance criterion on the overall fiscal deficit. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the year, several steps have been initiated to improve control over the PIP. A unit was established in the Ministry of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- Finance to monitor financial flows and a system of project selection criteria has been introduced. Existing projects have been prioritized and several have been delayed or suspended. Despite these efforts, however, program projections were exceeded, due to the bulkiness of some of the projects and insufficient information flows. With the arrival in July of a resident advisor, financed by the ADB, the work to improve control is expected to be accelerated and deepened. From August, project implementation units will report on a monthly basis to the unit in the Ministry of Finance. The authorities felt confident that with the better monitoring and steps to delay implementation of some projects, the target for the PIP for the year as a whole would be achievable. The better information flow would also allow them to take other offsetting measures if warranted. 25. While welcoming the improvements that have occurred, the mission expressed concern about the size of the PIP, which is large in view of both the lack of current domestic counterpart funds and the country’s capacity to repay the associated debt (Box 1). Furthermore, future maintenance and operation expenditures could be very large (e.g., Osh- Bishkek road), potentially crowding out other expenditures. The authorities shared these concerns, but noted that the large existing pipeline represents loans that have already been approved by creditors. Potential new commitments (i.e. projects in an advanced stage of preparation) could add even more. They indicated that they intended to contact creditors with a view to discussing this issue and possibly agreeing on a smaller, more focused PlP, with financing on even more concessional terms or on a grant basis. However, they noted this would take time to accomplish. 26. Understandings in principle have been reached with Russia and Turkey, and an agreement has been completed with Pakistan, on the rescheduling of outstanding external arrears and debt, which, based on the information provided to the staff, would provide significant debt service relief over the next few years and should allow some room for other expenditures. As a result of the agreements, international reserves will be higher than originally programmed at the end of the year (by close to $30 million), and corresponding adjustments have been made to the program targets on net international reserves and net domestic assets of the NBKR. 27. The authorities expressed concern that real public sector wages had been eroded significantly during the last 3 years, since no wage increases had been granted. They, therefore, decided to increase public sector wages by 20 percent. This increase, effective on August 1, adds about som 300 million to expenditures in 2000, but can be fully financed from the interest savings resulting from the debt rescheduling and, to a lesser extent, measures to reduce public sector employment. The original deficit target for 2000 under the program of som 4.1 million will be retained. While concurring with the increase, the mission noted that it would have been preferable if the authorities had been able to raise additional revenues to finance the increase in wages, especially because that could have helped offset the impact on next year’s budget. While welcoming the recent moves to consolidate agencies and reduce the staff in the Ministry of the Interior, the mission also underscored the need to widen the public administration reforms as soon as possible.

Public Investment Program Since 1994, the Kyrgyz Republic has been implementing a Public Investment Program (PIP) to improve the conditions for economic growth in the country. In recent years, however, the PIP has become a major policy issue because of its large size (9.5 percent of GDP and 65 percent of external budget financing in 1999), the quality and contribution of projects to achieving policy makers’ objectives, and the high external debt burden faced by the Kyrgyz Republic. Currently, some 50 foreign financed investment projects associated with PIP are underway in the Kyrgyz Republic, totaling about $675 million, $220 million of which had been disbursed as of mid-2000. The largest projects, based on committed amounts by donors, include construction of the Bishkek-Osh road ($174 million), rehabilitation of KyrgyzEnergo power and district heating (S 130 million), reconstruction of the Manas airport ($42 million), irrigation and rural development ($68 million), and agricultural sector development (various projects, $93 million) (see table below). Projects amounting to an additional $230 million are under discussion. Given the large number of projects associated with the PIP and the need to pursue fiscal consolidation, the authorities have embarked upon a program of ptiotitization and classification of projects, Based on advice from a PIP advisor recently put in place by the ADB and international experience, the following criteria will be used to classify both on-going and proposed future projects: . Compliance of project with strategic goals regarding economic development and growth, especially in the context of the PRSP. Impact of the project on economic, social, and ecological conditions. Appraisal of project implementation. Prospects for economic growth, given the structure of GDP. Social importance, which will be determined by the projects prospective impact on social security provision, unemployment, poverty alleviation, the delivery of social services such as education and health care, and the environment. Need for counterpart fimds and t%ture operating and maintenance expenditures. Project risk. Institutional capacity of implementing agency. Financial profitability (Le., net present value, internal rate of return, pay-back period). Projects in the social sector will be ranked according to their “social importance” in the sense that the wider the range of social problems that the project addresses the higher priority it will be given. In addition, proposed future projects will be ranked according to the above criteria and the terms of the loan, especially the level ,of concessionality. An inventory of investment projects financed by international financial institutions and donor countries has recently been completed. The inventory will allow the authorities to reassess project implementation and viability, and thus provide a guide for determining the benefits of future projects.

The authorities were not able to eliminate pension arrears at end- 1999 and maintain this in the first half of the year (as had originally been envisaged).16 Nevertheless, measures have been put in place to improve collections and, compared to the previous year, arrears were significantly smaller. In consultation with the World Bank (which has been involved in designing the pension reform), and taking into account seasonal@, the May mission agreed on a stock of arrears of som 75 million at end-June. This target was achieved with a significant margin. The authorities indicated that they intended to increase pensions in line with the increase in public sector wages. The mission expressed concern about an increase before all remaining arrears were cleared and stressed, in close collaboration with the World Bank, the importance of avoiding a deterioration of the financial position of the Social Fund in 2001 as a result of the increase. The authorities agreed that no increase would take place until the arrears were paid and that, if necessary in 200 1, a transfer from the budget would be made to ensure balance in the accounts of the Social Fund. 29. The mission held preliminary discussions on the 2001 budget. In addition to efforts to increase revenues, the mission also recommended that a serious attempt be made to further restructure expenditures, eliminate privileges and subsidies, and focus expenditures on the social sectors (Box 2). A further fiscal tightening, including through a reduction of the PIP, would also be necessary in view of the large debt service burden. The authorities broadly agreed, noting that legislation to streamline privileges and reduce the cost has already been submitted to parliament. They stressed, however, that they would need to carefully consider the size of the deficit and required cuts, taking into account, as noted above, the existing project pipeline and the outcome of the discussions with civil society on a poverty reduction strategy. B. Monetary Policy 30. The NBKR staff concurred with the mission’s advise that the NBKR should continue to pursue a tight monetary stance in the coming months to ensure that the favorable inflation outcome would be preserved and to help stabilize the currency. If money demand improved later in the year this could be reexamined. Given the very thin market for treasury bills, the introduction of National Bank bills in early June added a valuable additional monetary tool. Regarding exchange rate policy, there had been heavier than expected intervention (i.e., sales) in the foreign exchange market in the first part of the year, but the market had quieted since then and the NBKR staff intended to adhere to its current policy. The mission agreed that the current system of managed float in general bad served well, although at times, intervention had perhaps been heavier than warranted. However, it stressed that at this time, the NBKR’s main aim should be to preserve its international reserves and that intervention should be limited to smoothing out unwarranted fluctuations. I6 The original targets were overly ambitious but at the time the authorities insisted that they were feasible.

Military related expenditures have remained broadly constant at around 1.4-1.5 percent of GDP since 1995. In 1999 expenditures rose to an estimated 1.7 percent of GDP, due to the cost of containing an invasion by foreign rebels in the south of the country. Additional expenditures, mainly related to efforts to reinforce border controls are also expected in 2000. The Kyrgyz Republic does not have a professional army but relies on a cadre of border guards. The country received extensive assistance from other CIS countries in dealing with the rebels. 2. The Kyrgyz Republic faces a number of challenges in the environmental area, which due to budget constraints are difficult to tackle. First, there are significant problems related to the dumping and storage of uranium. There are 52 sites in the Kyrgyz Republic where runoff and other contamination poses serious dangers. Second, more than 70 percent of the water purification infrastructure needs improvement, especially in the rural areas, where 63 percent of the population resides. Third, there has been an extensive deterioration of land vegetation and quality due to both technological and natural causes. As a result, natural disasters such as land slides occur frequently. Fourth, air pollution in the large cities exceeds maximum a.Uowable standards by large margins. 3. Given the extent of poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic, social assistance could play an important role in augmenting the standard of living for many people. However, the weak fiscal position and lack of careful targeting, has undermined financial support for this assistance. At present, social assistance is provided through a number of programs (see Section IX of issues paper for more details), including: (i) the unified monthly benefit (UMB), a means-tested cash benefit given to the poorest families; (ii) state social benefits, cash benefits payable to orphans, certain groups of invalids, and retirees ineligible for pensions, specified as percentages of the maximum per capita income threshold for UMB; (iii) privileges in the form of pricing discounts of up to 100 percent for a wide array of goods and services for 11 broad categories of individuals; (iv) in the city of Bishkek, a means-tested program of housing subsidies, compensating eligible households for the difference between the household payment due for utilities consumed within certain standard norms and a given share of household income, and; (v) lifeline tariffs for electricity users, involving marginal prices for successive blocks of energy use. The government is augmenting these social protection measures under a World Bank program, including compensation for energy tariff increases for low-income households, and categorical assistance to five categories of currently privileged households. Concurrently, the government has submitted a draft law aimed at streamlining privileges and reducing the aggregate costs. 4. Reforms in the health and education sectors so far have focused on improving the services that are provided, but have not yet addressed the issue of efficiency of use of resources in these sectors. A comprehensive review of expenditures in health and education, conducted by the World Bank, is now available and its recommendations for reforms in the sectors are expected to be incorporated in the country’s poverty reduction strategy. In the meantime, the authorities have been making efforts to minimize the impact of across the board cuts on expenditures on health and education (other than wages). Indicative targets under the PRGF uromam were observed. 31. The restructuring of the banking system was relatively slow in 1999. In January 2000, an MAE mission found that 5 of the country’s 22 banks (accounting for 30 percent of total assets and 39 percent of deposits) were insolvent and an additional 6 banks (20 percent of assets and 15 percent of deposits) were classified as “Problem/Potential Problem.” Since that time, however, steps were taken to close one of the large insolvent banks and a general restructuring program was approved. This restructuring plan involves, among other things, a shifting of bank resolution and restructuring functions to a separate agency (DEBRA), Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - identification and improvement of supporting legal and institutional arrangements, strengthening of banking supervision, and the development of clear criteria for liquidating banks. The mission stressed that restoration of confidence in the banking system and the currency would require determined action on all fronts, including by addressing governance issues which are at the core of the problems. This will require actions to address problems arising from conflicts of interests and weaknesses in the judiciary system. 32. An important element in the restructuring strategy will be the recapitalization and restructuring of Kairat Bank, the country’s largest bank. Thus far the government has been reluctant to take a role in providing resources to restructure the banking system and the burden has been borne solely by the National Bank. The mission stressed that the government has to share in this burden and that resources for this will need to be made available in the 2001 budget. The size of the required assistance will be clearer after the completion of the audit of Kairat Bank that is currently ongoing. ” Further details of the restructuring of the bank will be worked out in consultation with MAE staff. 33. The mission noted that recently there had been calls for reducing the independence of the National Bank. Maintaining a strong independent central bank would be imperative, especially in an environment with banking problems. The authorities assured the staff that they had no desire to see the NBKR’s independence changed. C. Structural Reform 34. The mission expressed disappointment that the structural performance criterion on licensing had not been fully implemented. The authorities indicated that much had been done, but acknowledged that some procedures to streamline licensing procedures were not yet fully in place. New procedures had been worked out but implementation was awaiting a parliamentary decision on the precise activities that would remain subject to licensing. Approval is expected in September. Discussions on other structural reforms focused on the outlook for the next few years. The Kyrgyz Republic in recent years has adopted an impressive array of structural reforms, but actual implementation has frequently lagged and opportunities for graft and corruption abound. As a result, the business climate remains relatively unfriendly. The staff stressed that further efforts should be made to reduce licensing and inspection requirements and to implement existing legislation and regulations, which should reduce the opportunities for graft. A major public administration reform, focusing on the role, structure, and size of the government is urgently needed, both to reduce the role of government in the country and to improve governance. This reform should also address problems in the judiciary and law enforcement areas, which are a key factor in many of the governance problems. ” There are no precise estimates of the costs of the restructuring. In the past, the NBKR had indicated amounts on the order of l-l .5 percent of GDP. However, the latest estimate was considerably lower. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-21- 35. The mission welcomed the reforms in the energy sector. Significant further steps are expected in the future, supported by a credit from the World Bank, including tariff increases and reforms of the electricity company through separation of distribution and generation and preparation for eventual privatization. The mission expressed concern about an earlier reversal in the agricultural area, which provided an adverse signal about the commitment to reforms in this area. The authorities assured the staff that the first decree had been cancelled and that most of the provisions in the second decree would not be enforced. Nevertheless, some provisions had come into effect, although the financial impact would be limited. The mission also expressed concern about the slow pace of privatizing large enterprises. The authorities noted the general lack of interest by investors, but expressed confidence that Kyrgyz Telecom would be privatized shortly and that other privatization objectives for 2000 would also be achieved. The staff cautioned that care should be taken to ensure transparency in the privatization process to show that the Kyrgyz Republic is serious about attracting foreign direct investment. D. Medium-Term Outlook 36. During the recent missions, the staff learned that the medium-term external outlook for the Kyrgyz Republic has deteriorated Corn the projections presented to the Executive Board in February. The Kumtor mining company, which accounts for about one third of exports and 10 percent of GDP, earlier this year informed the authorities that it intends to accelerate production in the next few years and will start winding down its operations faster than earlier expected.18 While partly offset by the coming on stream of (prospective) new gold projects, the country’s balance of payments will be adversely affected. The mission had earlier projected a gradual improvement in the country’s current account, but even with rapid increases in exports of other goods and services, it is now expected that the current account will actually worsen starting in 2004, with the deficit rising to about 7 percent of GDP until 2006 before resuming a gradual decline thereafter. 37. Similarly, it is now expected that debt service ratios (both in nominal and in NPV terms) will worsen somewhat in 2005-2008, but improve thereafter. Nevertheless, the ratio of external debt-to-GDP is expected to continue declining. Debt service indicators remain relatively high in 2001 and 2002, although the agreed reschedulings reduce the ratios considerably compared to the original program.‘g The projections in Table 6 are sensitive to I8 Production would decline starting in 2004 before stopping mining operations altogether in 2008. ” Debt owed to Pakistan will be rescheduled over a period of 6 years, with a graduated payment schedule and interest at Libor plus one. The precise terms of the agreement with Russia have not yet been finalized. Based on the information provided by the authorities, the projections reflect a rescheduling of all debt outstanding over a 15 year period (except rescheduled arrears) with 3 years grace period. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - assumptions about the growth of exports. A rapid growth of exports of non-gold, as projected, is feasible with continued adjustment programs, a resumption of good relations with neighboring countries, and export oriented direct investment. A halving of export growth would increase the current account deficit by close to 5 percentage points at its peak in 2007 and debt service ratios would similarly increase substantially. However, it is unlikely that financing for such high deficits would be available and, therefore, further adjustment would be unavoidable (Box 3). Box 3. The Kumtor Gold Mining Project In May 1997, the Kumtor Operating Company, which is two-thirds owned by the Kyrgyz Republic and one- third by Cameco, a Canadian company, began gold mining operations in a remote and mountainous area of the Kyrgyz Republic. The construction of the mine cost $450 million, there was an initial estimate of 16.5 million troy ounces of gold resources (based on a gold price of $350/ounce), and gold production was expected to exceed 500,000 ounces a year over the life of the project. In the event, probable reserves were scaled back to around 9 million ounces as production began.’ Kumtor employs over 1,150 employees, of which 90 percent are Kyrgyz nationals. Cumulative gold production during the first three years of operation was 1.755 million troy ounces with an average cost of around S 175/ounce. In December 1999, the company revised its business plan to account for a number of factors: changes in the price of gold; experience it has gained in operating the mine; and changes to its geological model of the resource base. This plan assumes a gold price of $3 lo/ounce, with the effect of substantially lowering the remaining reserVe base to around 4.27 million troy ounces of gold. The following production schedule is envisioned: 649,000 ounces in 2000; 665,000 in 2001; 680,000 in 2002; 716,000 in 2003; 350,000 in 2004, 400,000 in 2005,250,OOO in 2006; 136,000 in 2007; and the mine being decommissioned in 2008. The revised, and accelerated production schedule, not only reflects the lower price of gold, relative to the initial plan, but also the desire to retire debt quickly. According to Company officials, Kumtor’s debt should be retired in 2003. The contract with Cameco specifies that profits from gold production will accrue to the budget after the debt has been retired. The authorities were informed of the revised business plan in early 2000. ’ A great deal of confusion has existed about the extent of the reserve base. The authorities had, until recently, been under the impression that the reserve base was close to the initial estimate provided in the mine feasibility study (16.5 million ounces). According to the company, however, this figure related to the resource, rather than the reserve base. 38. The authorities are justifiably concerned about the revised external outlook and had extensive discussions with the mission about this and the high debt. The mission stressed that even with the current account deficits of the magnitude projected, the situation was not sustainable, as both the debt and debt service ratios are projected to remain high. Furthermore, even with the relief from the present reschedulings, debt service payments will continue to require a large share of fiscal revenues which, unless additional revenues are found, will continue to limit room for other expenditures. The mission, therefore, stressed the need for further fiscal adjustment over the medium term. The authorities agreed, but noted that adjustment by itself will not be enough. They stressed that further ways to reduce the debt service burden needed to be explored, particularly because more than half of the debt is owed to multilateral institutions (see EBY99100, Debt sustainability analysis). They Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - indicated that they would continue to work with the Fund and others to fmd a so1ution.2o They felt that in 2001 and 2002 they could manage because of expected new foreign financing and the build-up of deposits during this year. In the meantime, with technical assistance from the Fund, efforts are continuing to improve the debt management capacity of the Ministry of Finance. 39. The impact of the revised medium-term outlook on the capacity to repay the Fund is shown in Table 7. While some of the ratios of debt service to the Fund rise a bit compared to the original program, in the view of the staff this in not unduly worrisome, in particular because the level of gross reserves of the NBKR now is higher than originally expected; scheduled debt service payments to the Fund will not exceed 14 percent of gross reserves in any year. Furthermore, the good payments record of the authorities provides some assurance that payments to the Fund will continue to be made on time. 40. To help improve the external outlook, the mission underscored that structural reforms must be pursued with vigor to create an environment conducive to attracting direct foreign investment and for export-led growth. The liberal trade regime-the country rates a 1 on the scale of the Fund’s restrictiveness indicators-should be maintained and efforts should be made to improve relations with neighboring countries. Kazakhstan has removed import duties on goods from the Kyrgyz Republic, but trade flows are still hampered by “ecological fees” imposed by individual oblasts in Kazakhstan on all transit, and licensing fees for some key products. Relations with Uzbekistan remain more difficult with frequent border closures and the imposition of high excise taxes on goods from the Kyrgyz Republic. The authorities indicated to the mission that they are engaged in discussions with their neighbors to attempt to improve the situation, but to a large extent this was a political issue and they did not know when the situation would improve. They also expressed hope that, in the context of the WTO, trade with other countries would increase. 41. The staff discussed the importance of continued improvements in the statistical base. Much has been done in recent years, but some deficiencies still exist, although these in general do not impede the analysis of economic developments or the monitoring of program performance. Weaknesses persist in a number of areas including in the national accounts, trade, and debt statistics (described in Appendix IV). The authorities stressed that they continue to work on improvements and that they appreciate all the Fund technical assistance that has been provided. A number of measures are being pursued to improve the quality of statistics in line with the GDDS. 42. The authorities attach great importance to designing a poverty alleviation strategy. In the context of the World Bank’s Comprehensive Development Strategy (CDF) a secretariat ” Staff of the Fund and the Bank are preparing a paper on debt in low income countries of the CIS, including the Kyrgyz Republic, which will lay out some of the issues involved for the consideration of the Executive Board. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - has been set up and procedures for consultations and the preparation of inputs are being put in place. Several workshops have been organized with participation by civil society (in particular NGOs), academics, donors, and multilateral and bilateral agencies. Consultations have also started at the local level. The authorities indicated that they expect a full-fledged Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper to be finalized early next year. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 43. The Kyrgyz economy faced a difficult year in 1999 and most macroeconomic indicators worsened significantly. Nevertheless, in the second half of the year and in the fnst part of 2000 the authorities took a number of measures aimed at stabilizing the economy and reinvigorating the structural adjustment program. While the staff is disappointed that the PRGF program went off-track in the first few months of the year, it is encouraged that steps were subsequently taken to bring it back on track although this wasTartly the result of the better-than-expected economic performance. It urges the authorities to continue implementing the program vigorously to achieve the objectives for the year, and to establish a sound basis for economic growth over the medium term. 44. After some difficulties in the first half of 1999, the stance of monetary policy has been appropriately tight, which has contributed to the relative stability of the exchange rate. The NBKR’s challenge will be to maintain this policy stance to further reduce inflation and restore confidence in the domestic currency. While regretting the slow initial response to the problems in the banking sector, the staff welcomes recent actions in this area, including the adoption of a comprehensive restructuring program. Full implementation of this program will be important to restore confidence and to attract savings that are necessary for the development of the economy. Addressing problems in individual banks, including those related to governance, and improving the legal and judiciary system will be important elements. The staff urges the authorities to proceed in this area without delay. 45. While the fiscal situation in 1999 was difficult and the overall budget deficit rose, some progress was made, including in the elimination of budgetary arrears. The authorities have embarked on an ambitious fiscal adjustment in 2000. Despite a notable reduction in the overall fiscal deficit, difficulties continued in the first quarter of 2000, however, as revenues fell short of expectations, but with better collection this was reversed in the second quarter. Arrears at the central level were also eliminated. The staff welcomes the authorities stated commitment to achieving the original program deficit target for 2000, but notes that this will require continued efforts to increase revenues, especially to ensure that the improvements in tax collection in May and June were not temporary. In this regard, the staff regrets that most of the revenue measures that were included in the program were not adopted which will lead to lower than expected revenues in relation to GDP. This is especially worrisome because raising the level of revenue collection, including through an expansion of the revenue base, is necessary to be able to deal with the heavy debt service burden. The staff strongly urges the authorities to make every effort to adopt the earlier agreed tax changes for inclusion in next year’s budget if not earlier. Further improvements in tax administration should be pursued. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25- 46. On the expenditure side, the staff welcomes the fact that current expenditures were contained in the first half of 2000. The staff understands the reasons for the recent wage increase and welcomes the efforts to reduce the number of government employees, but regrets that it was not possible to take further compensating revenue measures. As further fiscal consolidation will need to include a rationalization of expenditures, the staff recommends that the authorities carefully consider the composition of expenditures in 2001 and beyond. The introduction of the expenditure warrant system is a welcome step to improve expenditure control. The staff encourages the authorities to continue to implement the measures included under the program in this area. 47. The staff is concerned about the size of the PIP and the fact that overruns led to the nonobservance of the performance criterion under the program on the budget deficit for end- June. The staff welcomes the progress that has been made to date to improve control over the PIP, but much remains to be done. The PIP is very large and will entail significant cost for operations and maintenance in the future as well as debt service. The staff strongly urges the authorities to continue working to improve control and to engage creditors in a discussion of the appropriate size of the PIP. The terms of future project borrowing will also need to be carefully considered. 48. The medium-term outlook remains difficult and the external debt situation is worrisome. The debt service burden remains high, especially in the next few years, despite rescheduling of part of the non-concessional debt. To help address this problem, as noted above, further fiscal consolidation with significant efforts to improve revenues will be necessary. Structural reforms aimed at improving the investment climate and increasing the export base should also be strengthened. As adjustment alone may not be enough, the staff encourages the authorities, in cooperation with the Fund and other creditors, to further explore ways to deal with this debt. The contracting of new debt, including for the PIP, should be strictly limited. Furthermore, improvements in debt management procedures and practices should continue to be pursued. 49. There was some slowdown in structural reforms in 1999 and the interventions in the agricultural sector in early 2000 were disappointing. Nevertheless, the staff is encouraged by recent progress in public sector and energy sector reform. However, redoubled efforts are necessary to show the commitment of the Kyrgyz Republic to structural reforms and improve the business environment, including through continued privatization and further simplification of licensing requirements. Public administration reform, including a reduction in the size of the government, will need to be part and parcel of the adjustment program, combined with steps to fumly apply the rule of law and reduce governance problems. 50. The staff acknowledges the progress that has been made in improving statistics and encourages the authorities to continue on this path, particularly in the areas of national accounts and trade statistics. Strong efforts should also be made to improve debt statistics. 51. While the staff believes that the authorities are committed to the implementation of the program for the remainder of this year, there are risks. Presidential elections are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - scheduled for October 29, that could lead to additional spending pressures in the coming months. Furthermore, problems could emerge if the authorities are not able to maintain the relatively good revenue performance of the last few months and this will need to be closely monitored. At the same time, despite initial difficulties, the authorities have brought the PRGF program back and track, and steps have been and are being taken to address some of the weaknesses, including to improve control over the PIP. Furthermore, external debt service arrears have been dealt with and pension arrears were reduced below the level agreed with the staff. 52. In view of the above, and taking account of the risks, the staff supports the authorities request for completion of the first and second (midterm) review under the PRGF arrangement and the request for a waiver for the nonobservance of the performance criteria on pension arrears and the cumulative budget deficit at end-June 2000, for the non-observance of the performance criteria on external arrears, and for non-observance of the structural performance criterion on licensing for end-June. 53. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The strategy confirmed the principal objectives of the Interim Operational Strategy that had guided ADB’s operations in the Kyrgyz Republic since 1994. These objectives are: (i) support for the government’s reform through encouraging institutional changes and strengthening institutional capacity, and improving the provision of public services; (ii) encouraging private sector development; and (iii) improving long-term growth potential through investment in both physical infrastructure and human development and preserving the environment. In achieving these objectives, the COS has deliberately adopted a sharp focus on a small number of strategic areas, including (i) improvement in the provision of public services, particularly social services provided by local governments and the management of reform by the central government; (ii) agriculture, including rural finance; (iii) human development, especially education; and (iv) infrastructure rehabilitation. In 1999, in response to the negative effects of the Russian crisis, the ADB’s reach was broadened to include assistance to the financial sector. This selective approach has enabled the ADB to maintain a strong sector presence and a well focused policy dialogue. To date, ADB has approved 16 loans, all on concessional terms, totaling $422.2 million, of which about $245 million had been disbursed by July 3 1,200O. Lending for fast disbursing, policy based projects has accounted for about 4 1 percent of total lending. Besides loan operations, ADB has extended technical assistance (TA) grants totaling about $24 million since 1994. The TA operations follow the sharp sectoral focus of the COS and complement the ADB’s loan operations. A high proportion of the TA assistance is for supporting the government’s efforts for institution strengthening and capacity building, with a view to supporting sustainable economic development. In 1997 the ADB initiated support for enhanced subregional economic cooperation among the Central Asian republics and the western-most province of the People’s Republic of China. In 1998, the ADB approved a Private Sector Strategy for Central Asia. The thrust of the strategy is to complement the ADB’s public sector operations with various instruments including nonguaranteed equity participation and loans to privately sponsored projects. With the adoption in 1999 of poverty reduction as the ADB’s overarching objective, deliberate shifts are being made in the operational program to ensure more explicit support for projects which include beneficiaries living below the poverty line and for projects which will assist others to remain out of poverty.

A comprehensive program to increase the accuracy and reliability of data from the National Statistical Committee (NSC) has been developed with the assistance of a long-term multitopic statistical advisor from the IMF. One of the aims of this program is the adoption of international standards for the collection, processing, classification, and dissemination of data. The NSC maintains a comprehensive and regularly updated data web site largely incorporating Fund dissemination standards metadata structure and format, with good coverage and timeliness (http//stat-gvc.bishkek.su). The recent decision by the authorities to participate in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) should provide an impetus to statistical development. National Accounts 2. Technical assistance has been received from the IMF, EUROSTAT, OECD, World Bank, and bilateral donors. While significant progress has been achieved in properly estimating GDP, the estimates still suffer from absence of accurate primary data. Difficulties also remain in properly estimating the degree of underreporting, especially in the private sector, and in valuation. To improve the coverage and reliability of primary data, work has been undertaken to introduce scientific sampling procedures. According to the most recent STA TA mission, improved sampling procedures have been adopted for household surveys and new report forms are being introduced in the enterprise sector. With the creation of a new division in the NSC, it is expected that the adoption of sampling procedures will spread to other surveys. However, subannual national accounts statistics are still collected on a cumulative basis rather than by discrete time periods. In general, data dissemination of national accounts statistics is prompt and the authorities are in the process of switching to the NACE system of classification, Prices, wages, and employment 3. The new CPI has been published since January 1995, and the new PPI has been published since October 1996. They are both calculated according to international standards although their coverage needs to be improved. The CPI needs to be extended to include sub- indices for imports and goods and services covered by administered prices. The coverage of the PPI, which was already broadened in May 1997, is to be expanded further in the coming years. 4. Although progress has been made in computing unit value indices for imports and exports, data are computed on a cumulative basis. Work continues with regard to computation of these indices using a standard index presentation and the development of an export price index.

Problems exist in the compilation of the average wage, especially with respect to the valuation of payments in kind and the coverage of the private sector. Also, the monthly statistics are not comparable with the annual data due to different coverage and classifications. 6. The coverage of unemployment includes an estimate of unregistered unemployed. However, data are very weak and there are many inconsistencies between labor force, employment, and unemployment data. With the assistance of the World Bank, work continues to compile data based on surveys, according to internationally agreed definitions. Fiscal accounts 7. The coverage of the budget has been improved significantly since 1995 with the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank. While expenditure data is set up according to GFS standards, some specific expenditure items are misclassified in the budget and treasury accounts. Data for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook were provided for the first time in 1999. However, at present only revenue and grant data, and expenditure data by function, are of publishable standard. 8. Data on public and publicly guaranteed debt have improved, but weaknesses remain. Occasionally there are differences in data provided by the Ministry of Finance and the NBKR. With the assistance of a resident advisor, the Ministry of Finance is in the process of computerizing the debt information that is available. Monetary sector 9. The authorities introduced new charts of accounts for the NBKR and the commercial banks during 1997, with the assistance of a resident MAE advisor and the USAID. A money and banking statistics mission in March 1999 reviewed the compilation of the monetary data and found that the classification of accounts is generally in accordance with the Fund’s methodology. However, the mission identified areas where the charts of accounts and accompanying instructions need to be improved. Monetary data for IFS publication have been reported on a regular monthly basis with a lag of about one month. External sector 10. The compilation of balance of payment statistics has improved with the assistance from STA. Data on imports and exports are now based on customs records. However, the shuttle trade with the countries of the customs union-Russian Federation, Belarus and Kazakhstan-is not accurately estimated. Dissemination of international trade statistics started in June 1998. The NBKR compiles balance of payments statistics in cooperation with the NSC. Coordination with the NSC has been intensified, but coverage deficiencies remain with respect to trade and services and direct investment.

In 1996-97, with the development of the Kumtor gold mine and favorable weather that helped boost agricultural production, the decline in output which characterized the transition to a market economy was quickly reversed. Growth in those years was 7 and 10 percent, respectively, and efforts at stabilization and structural reform were beginning to pay off. Inflation was being brought down and the current-account deficit fell to single digits for the first time since independence in 1991. The Russian crisis in 1998, however, changed this picture, particularly because the authorities were initially slow to adopt an appropriate policy response. 2. The som experienced a sharp depreciation of about 30 percent in dollar terms between end-August and end-December 1998 and inflation jumped. Domestic problems were further exacerbated by deteriorating trade relations between the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, the country’s most important CIS trading partners outside of Russia. The economic situation remained very difficult in the first part of 1999, even though inflation appeared to slow and the exchange rate began to stabilize. These developments reflected, in part, the difficult steps that the authorities adopted, albeit somewhat late, toward the end of 1998 to deal with the situation. Nonetheless, a crisis emerged in the banking system, leading to a decline in confidence, a further slide in the som (partially related to the introduction of a floating exchange rate in Kazakhstan), and a pickup in inflation. Over the course of 1999, the som depreciated from som 29.4 per dollar to 45.3 and inflation (cumulatively) amounted to nearly 40 percent. Real GDP growth in that year registered 3.6 percent, being driven almost entirely by buoyant agricultural production. Over the first half of 2000, economic activity rebounded, with GDP growth estimated at around 7.4 percent, compared with a year earlier, and inflation was reduced to its lowest level for this period since independence. Imports contracted sharply in 1999 which led to an improvement in the current-account deficit of about 4 percentage points, although at more than 16 percent of GDP it is still high. 3. On the fiscal side, the budget deficit deteriorated, rising more than 2.5 percentage points to 12 percent of GDP in 1999. Additional budgetary arrears were also incurred. The fiscal situation remained difficult in the first part of 2000 and revenues fell short of expectations. Nevertheless, by end-June the revenue picture had improved. With a decline in tax revenues as a share of GDP, the deficit has been primarily financed by borrowing from bilateral creditors and multilateral financial institutions. As a result of the high level of past borrowing and the rapid depreciation of the exchange rate more recently, the stock of external public debt is now more than 110 percent as a share of GDP, and interest payments alone on that debt account for more than 2.5 percent of GDP. The authorities have recently made progress with creditors in rescheduling some debt, however, the situation remains problematic, since the medium-term outlook for the balance of payments has deteriorated . As result of a revised production schedule at the Kumtor gold mine, exports are expected to slow down starting in 2004.(Kumtor accounts for around one-third of exports and 10 percent of GDP.)

Some progress has been made over the past year or so in the area of structural reform, although the pace of reform has slowed compared with the pre-Russia-crisis period. The key measures pursued included: a comprehensive reform of the pension system; an amendment to the constitution to allow full private ownership of land; changes in the health sector; the issuance of a tender for the privatization of Kyrgyz Telecom; and the adoption of a plan for the restructuring of the financially troubled energy monopoly, KyrgyzEnergo. However, reforms have lagged in the area of public administration reform, privatization of large enterprises, and the application of a rules based legal framework.

This letter supplements our letter and attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) of the Government and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) for 2000, transmitted to Mr. Camdessus on January 22,2000, requesting a second annual arrangement under the successor three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). 2. Developments in the first quarter of 2000 under the program were less favorable than we had expected when the program was approved and as a result, several of the program’s performance criteria for end-March were not observed. Since then, however, we have made a determined effort to bring the program back on track and most of the quantitative performance criteria and all indicative targets for end-June were observed (Table 1). At the same time, the performance criteria on the cumulative fiscal deficit, and on external and pension arrears were not observed, as explained below. The structural performance criterion for end-March and one of the two criteria for end-June were fully observed, as were most of the structural benchmarks (albeit some with a slight delay). The second structural performance criterion for end-June on licensing was partly observed, as some improvements to procedures can only be implemented after approval of amendments to the law on licensing. We expect this law to be discussed and approved in September. 3. The economic situation has improved considerably in recent months. Real GDP growth at 7.4 percent and inflation at 7.1 percent for the first six months of the year were more favorable than we had earlier expected. Monetary policy has been kept tight and the exchange rate has remained stable. After a very weak first quarter, fiscal revenues recovered significantly in May and June and current expenditures were contained, although this was not sufficient to offset unexpectedly higher capital expenditures, for the reasons outlined below. At the same time, we incurred debt service arrears to some of our creditors while we were engaged in discussions to achieve a reduction in our heavy debt service burden. 4. We believe that we have made substantial gains on the stabilization front and have brought the program back on track. The government and the NBKR remain committed to achieving the program objectives for the rest of the year, although we recognize that in some areas our program commitments will need to be modified somewhat. Below we describe Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - ATTACHMENT I these modifications, for which we request the Fund’s approval, and the steps we are taking to ensure that the program’s general objectives are achieved. Table 1 attached to this letter specifies quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for the second half of the program year. Table 2 lists structural performance criteria and benchmarks for that period. 5. In light of the developments in the first half of the year we have revised our 2000 growth projection upward to around 5 percent and inflation downward to around 15 percent, despite significant upward adjustments in prices of imported oil and gasoline, and an increase in government wages (see below). Monetary policy will continue to be tight in order to achieve the inflation projection, in line with the targets shown in Table 1. The savings on debt service related to restructuring of our external debt will be added to international reserves; we now expect to achieve a gross international reserves level at end-2000 on the order of $200 million (3.5 months of imports), about $30 million more than originally envisaged. National Bank bills were introduced in June, which should provide us with an additional monetary instrument. 6. Since the beginning of the year we have also made progress in addressing the problems in the banking sector. Specifically, a comprehensive strategy for restructuring of the financial and banking system was adopted, Bishkek Bank was closed, Kurulush Bank was partially recapitalized, another small bank was put under temporary supervision, and capital requirements were increased as of August 1. On site inspections have been accelerated and by end-July 11 institutions were examined. By end-September we intend to complete inspections of 13 institutions, and the remaining banks by the end of the year. By end- November, in close cooperation with Fund staff, we will adopt a restructuring plan for Kairat Bank. By end-2000 a tender will be issued for the privatization of the Savings and Settlement Corporation. To reestablish confidence in the banking sector and to bring the bank restructuring program to a successful conclusion, a strong independent National Bank will be important. The government will not initiate any proposals that would undermine this independence. 7. As noted above, revenue performance improved significantly in recent months, and despite the fact that parliament did not approve the increases in the retail and land tax envisaged under the program, the performance criterion on cash tax revenues for end-June was observed. Parliament also did not approve an extension of the VAT base to include excises and customs and other duties. Nevertheless, with the better growth performance, some increase in revenues on account of amendments to the taxation of products produced in free economic zones and sold domestically, and continued efforts to improve tax and customs administration (in line with our understandings with IMF staff), we expect to achieve our original revenue targets. In addition, we have already increased the patent tax for certain highly profitable activities and as of September will increase the license fee for the right to sell alcohol. The new tax regime for vehicles, approved on July 19, will be strictly enforced. We realize the importance of increasing tax revenues to deal with our heavy debt service burden and in September will also resubmit to parliament draft legislation to increase the retail tax rate and to expand the VAT base, together with proposed amendments to legislation to improve the use of cash registers and reduce incentives for tax avoidance. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - ATTACHMENT I 8. As noted above, current expenditures have been kept in line with program commitments, however, higher-then-expected capital expenditures, associated with the foreign financed investment program (PIP) led to the non-observance of the performance criterion on the fiscal deficit for end-June. The outcome was about sorn 120 million (0.2 percent of annual GDP) higher than allowed under the program. The expenditures were to a large extent related to the implementation of a few large projects (including the Osh- Bishkek road, the restructuring of KyrgyzEnergo, and the Manas airport) which accounted for almost 75 percent of all capital expenditures. Since the beginning of the year we have made significant efforts to improve both control and projections of PIP-related expenditures, although this has proven insufficient, partly in view of the lumpiness of several of the project disbursements. Specifically, we have established a dedicated PIP unit in the Ministry of Finance and established criteria for the selection and prioritization of expenditures. Despite a delay in technical assistance to the unit, we have completed an inventory of existing investment projects and delayed or suspended a number of projects. Unfortunately there still are delays in reporting financial flows for the projects and thus it is difficult to react to deviations from the program in a timely fashion. 9. Despite these problems we aim contain the PIP to the level established in the program. To improve control, as of August 1, project implementation units will present on a monthly basis progress reports to the PIP Department of the Ministry of Finance for efficient monitoring of the usage of PIP funds. Furthermore, with the assistance of the technical assistance adviser, we aim to strengthen the technical skills of the PIP Department of the Ministry of Finance as well as the State Committee on Foreign Investments and Economic Development, with special emphasis on enhancing the economic and financial analysis of investment projects and, using the developed evaluation system of scores, on prioritizing projects, taking into account the economic and social impact. Because of the large size of the PIP and the heavy involvement of multilateral and bilateral creditors, we intend to approach creditors later in the year with a view to discuss a further rationalization and reduction of the investment program. 10. One expenditure area where we are deviating from the original program is budgetary wage policy as we decided to increase wages by 20 percent on average as of August 1. This increase, in our view is warranted on several grounds: (i) wages for civil servants have not been raised since 1997 and have been cut in half in real terms between the beginning of 1997 and June 2000; (ii) such increase will help improve the poverty situation, since current wage income for public sector employees is below the poverty line, and; (iii) improving income levels for public sector employees should help to reduce corruption. The increase in the wage bill will be offset by savings on interest payments to Russia (som 300 million), resulting from our agreement to restructure the debt owed. We have also reached agreement on a rescheduling with Pakistan and are expecting to conclude discussions with Turkey in the near future. Other debt service arrears have been paid. Furthermore, in late June and early July, we initiated steps to reinvigorate civil service reform, including, amongst others, a merger of government audit agencies, elimination of some ministerial departments, and a downsizing of the Ministry of the Interior, which should result in a reduction of the number of government employees. However, savings from these changes are not expected to be significant this year Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 64 - ATTACHMENT I because of required separation payments. The programmed budget deficit will be maintained at som 4.1 billion for the year, which in terms of GDP (at 6.8 percent) signifies a moderate tightening compared with the original program target. 11. In tandem with the increase in wages, we have also increased pensions by 20 percent. Pension arrears were reduced to som 45.5 million at end-June. While this was higher than originally programmed, it was lower than the level of som 75 million agreed with Fund staff, in consultation with Bank staff, earlier this year. Eliminating all arrears by the end of last year had proven impossible. The last remaining pension arrears were eliminated before the pension increase was announced, and we are confident that we can finance the additional cost from our improved receipts, which will be partly generated by higher than earlier expected wages (including in the private sector). 12. Besides the steps in civil service and banking reform mentioned above, we have made progress in most other areas of structural reform included in the program, including: amending taxation of free economic zones; reducing licensing requirements (although some steps still remain to be taken); simplifying and clarifying inspection requirements; and, removing conflict of interest situations. We are confident that the procedures to simplify licensing procedures will be in place by the end of September. We will also take strong steps to remove regulatory authority from all market participants. Due to lack of consultants or funds, some measures may be delayed somewhat from the original target dates (e.g. conclusion of audit of Kyrgyzgas) but nevertheless these measures are being implemented. We would like to stress that we have made significant progress with reforms in the energy sector, including a 40 percent increase in electricity tariffs and unification of gas tariffs. These reforms will continue with financial support from the World Bank, which is expected to be approved shortly. We also assure you that we will continue our reforms in the agriculture sector, which we see as key to the future development of this country. In the context we will seek the elimination of the moratorium on land sales by the end of this year. 13. We are in the process of further working out a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, in consultation with civil society and donors. Significant preparatory work has been done and procedures have been put in place to involve all layers of the population. During the next few months we expect to consolidate the inputs that have been provided and to complete the remaining analytical work, which will allow us to complete the design of our strategy later this year or early 2001. 14. In view of the steps we have already taken to bring the program back on track and the measures we intend to implement during the rest of the year, as well as the elimination of the external and pension arrears, we request waivers for the non-observance of the performance criteria on pension arrears and the cumulative fiscal deficit at end-June, 2000, and on the non observance of the performance criteria or external debt service arrears. We also request a waiver for the non-observance of the structural performance criterion on licensing for end- June. On that basis we request the completion of the first and mid-term reviews under the PRGF program, with the concurrent approval of the disbursements of SDR 4.77 million each, relating to these reviews.
