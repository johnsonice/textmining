INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. Recent economic developments in Samoa have been largely favorable. Since a number of mainly weather related shocks in the early 199Os, which reduced domestic output and income, a consistent policy aimed at a combination of macroeconomic stability and structural reforms has resulted in a remarkable pick-up in growth in recent years. In concluding the last consultation on February 17,1999, Directors commended the authorities on their sound macroeconomic policies that have reduced inflation to low levels, increased foreign reserves, and lowered external debt. They considered that the main challenge facing the authorities was to lay the basis for sustained growth while diversifying the economic structure and reducing its vulnerability to external shocks. Since then, the authorities have further strengthened the economy by continuing to implement a wide range of structural reforms, including financial sector reform and reform of the public sector, especially in the areas of corporatization of government departments and privatization of state enterprises. 2. The discussions focused on the need to implement macroeconomic policies that would avoid overheating of the economy. The staff advised the authorities to reduce government expenditure and save excess tax revenue from higher-than-expected GDP growth to keep the deficit at the lower end of the government’s medium-term target of 3-3s percent of GDP, and to stand ready to tighten monetary policy if signs of inflation or tensions in the balance of payments were to emerge. The authorities indicated their intention to take measures to prevent the fiscal deficit from exceeding 3% percent of GDP, and agreed with the staff on the need for an early monetary response if inflationary or balance of payments pressures were to emerge. 3. The staff also emphasized that fiscal consolidation is needed over the medium term to reduce dependency on official transfers, keep public debt on a sustainable path, and ensure sufficient room for private sector development. The authorities aim to achieve current budgetary surpluses over the medium term, while allowing limited overall deficits for externally financed development projects. 4. The staff welcomed recent initiatives to improve the supervision and regulation of Samoa’s financial sector, including its Offshore Financial Center. II. ECONOMIC SETTING A. Background 5. Samoa is a small island economy in the South Pacific with a population of about 177,000 and a per capita income of US$1,350. Emigration has kept the population relatively stable in recent years, while economic growth has been supported by prudent macroeconomic policies and a wide-ranging program of structural reforms. Social indicators compare favorably with most other lower middle-income countries in the region. The political situation in Samoa has been stable and the ruling Human Rights Protection Party won reelection in March 200 1.

With a production and export base concentrated on agriculture and fishing, the economy remains highly vulnerable to commodity price swings, weather conditions, and other external shocks. Cyclones and a tat-o leaf blight severely damaged the economy in the early 199Os, and a drought affected agricultural production adversely in 1998. The economy remains heavily dependent on transfers from abroad. Private remittances, mostly from Samoan emigrants, are equivalent to about 15 percent of GDP, while official transfers, mainly from Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, were on average about 10 percent of GDP in recent years. Since the second half of the 199Os, tourism has become an increasingly important source of foreign income and is estimated to account for about 15 percent of GDP, although part of the recent increase in tourism may be temporary. B. Recent Developments 7. The pace of economic activity picked up in recent years, while inflation has remained low (Table 1 and Figure 1). Real GDP growth is estimated to have risen from 3% percent in 1998 to 5% percent in 1999 and 6% percent in 2000. The strong growth performance in 1999 was fueled by a pick up in construction activity and a strong performance of the tourist sector, which benefited from celebrations of the new millennium and a number of large international meetings. The recovery in the agricultural sector and a continued sharp pick up in private and public construction activity contributed to the further acceleration of GDP growth in 2000. In spite of the strong growth in demand, consumer price inflation remained low in 1999 (% percent) and 2000 (1 percent). Lower prices of local agricultural produce offset higher import prices for fuel and building materials (Box 1). 8. The external current account surplus (including transfers) declined from 7 percent of GDP in 1999 to 3% percent of GDP in 2000, largely on account of higher imports and lower private remittances, but the level of gross international reserves has remained fairly comfortable at 5% months of imports (Table 2 and Figure 2). The worsening of the current account was partly offset by larger official loan disbursements than in 1999. External debt at end-2000 is estimated to have declined further to 62 percent of GDP, which is still high compared to other islands in the region. The debt-service ratio, which has been low given the concessionary nature of most of the debt, remained at 12% percent of exports of goods and services in 2000. 9. Samoa has maintained its international competitiveness, as reflected by a real effective exchange rate that has been broadly stable over the past two years (Figure 3). After the small devaluation of the tala against the currency basket in the wake of the Asian crisis, the real value of the tala in terms of the U.S. dollar has moved broadly in line with other currencies in the region. The decline in export volumes in 1999 and 2000 was due to a slowdown, and finally a halt, in coconut oil and copra exports following the closure of Samoa’s coconut oil mill.

Samoa: Recent price Developments CPI inflation has declined steadily since 1997 reaching an annual average rate of 0.3 percent in 1999, its lowest level in four years. This disinflationary trend compares favorably with other small island economies in the region (Table 1). The main factors behind the recent disinflation were a fall in food prices primarily due to a Table 1. CPI Inflation (period average) strong and sustained increase in agricultural 1997 1998 1999 output and the favorable impact of the import Samoa 6.8 2.2 0.3 tariff reforms enacted in mid-1998. Samoa’s rate of inflation is primarily determined by the Fiji 3.4 5.7 2.0 prices of local agricultural produce and imported Solomon 8.1 12.4 8.3 goods. The local component of the CPI (with a Islands weight of 53.5 percent in the CPI index) rose Tonga 2.1 3.4 4.5 marginally by half a percent in 1998 and fell by Vanuatu 2.8 3.3 2.0 1.5 percent in 1999 largely due to the impact of lower domestically produced food prices. The Source: IFS imported component of the CPI (with a weight of 46.5 percent in the CPI index) increased by 4.4 percent and 2.5 percent in 1998 and 1999 respectively. These increases resulted from higher imported food and consumer goods prices due to the nominal depreciation of the tala relative to the currencies of major trading partners-and 1 ;her oil prices in 1999. Inflation remained low in 2000. The annual average rate of CPI inflation was one percent in 2000. The local component of the CPI increased by 0.7 percent with lower prices for major local food crops including taro, largely offsetting higher prices for fish and other local food items. The imported component of the CPI increased by 1.3 percent primarily reflecting higher prices for fuel and imported building materials. The oil price increases in 1999 Consumer Price Inflation l6 - (12~month moving average; year-on-year percent change) and 2000 contributed to a rise in measured inflation of about 1 percentage point. Using only the CPI weight for automotive fuel (2.3 percent), a simple analysis implies that the 37.5 and 56.5 percent petroleum spot price increases contributed to a 0.9 and 1.3 percentage point increase in inflation in 1999 and 2000 respectively. Future oil price developments may have a greater impact on measured inflation as the authorities intend to review the CPI basket with the objective of better reflecting :urrent consumption patterns including a higher weight for fuel.

After four consecutive years of surpluses, the overall fiscal balance (including grants) moved into deficit in 1999/00 (Table 3). The main factor explaining the turnaround was the sizeable decline in external grants. Nevertheless, the actual deficit in 1999/00 (3/4 percent of GDP) was smaller than projected in the budget (3 percent of GDP), due to the temporary delay of some development expenditure and a slight reduction in current expenditure. The 2000/01 budget envisages a further widening of the fiscal deficit to 3% percent of GDP, reflecting the carry-forward of the development expenditures (including large copayments on external infrastructure loans), short-run costs related to the privatization program, and conservative revenue estimates. 11. Monetary policy has been accommodative. Money supply increased sharply in both 1999 and 2000, while key interest rates were lowered in April 2000 (Table 4 and Figure 4). The major contributor to broad money growth was domestic credit, which has risen sharply in recent years. Annual growth in credit to the private sector was close to 20 percent in 1999 and 2000, with the trade and construction sectors accounting for most of the new lending. The loan-deposit ratio of commercial banks increased from 87 percent in early 1998 to 100 percent at end-2000, and banks reduced their reserves with the central bank to expand their loan portfolios. The government also contributed to the process of monetary expansion, as it drew down its deposits with the banking system for the first time since 1994. 12. Public sector reform has continued in 1999 and 2000, most notably with the sale of government majority shareholdings and the corporatization of the Post and Telecommunications Department. However, civil service reform-which includes the transfer of responsibilities for financial and human resource management to line departments, implementation of performance-based management, and the reduction in the number of civil servants-is progressing slower than anticipated (Box 2). III. thJTLOOK AND RE.!JKS 13. Samoa’s near-term economic outlook is favorable, with robust GDP growth and low inflation (Annex I). Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 5 percent in 2001 after the construction-led expansion of 2000. The construction sector is, nevertheless, expected to remain a driving force for some time as a large number of public investment projects are still in the pipeline. In addition, the further recovery of tar-o production and the expansion of the fishing fleet are expected to lend additional momentum to near-term growth. Inflation is projected to pick up somewhat to 1% percent in 2001, as the decline in agricultural prices appears to have bottomed out and import prices continue to edge up. 14. The current account is expected to improve slightly in 2001, mainly on account of higher official transfers. Official development grants are projected to increase by US$l% million to provide financing for the government’s development projects. The decline in exports is projected to reverse, as fish exports are expected to increase with the expansion Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- Box 2. Samoa: Public Sector Reform Samoa has adopted a wide-ranging public sector reform program to create a more efficient and more accountable government that focuses on core activities. In recent years, the reform program has made good progress on many fronts with the introduction of output budgeting, greater emphasis on strategic planning, increased autonomy of line departments, and the implementation of the privatization and corporatization program. Privatization has been the most successful area in the public sector reform program. Privatization of SOEs has been high on the government’s policy agenda since the mid-1980s and between 1987 and 1996 21 SOEs were liquidated or privatized.’ Despite slowing progress, much has been achieved in recent years; most notably: 0 The divestment of the government’s 17 percent holding in Samoa Industrial Gases; 0 The corporatization of the Post and Telecommunications Department; 0 The reduction of the government’s holding in Samoa Breweries from 66 percent to 15.5 percent. Budget reforms have been successful and have contributed to greater fiscal discipline. The treasury department has set sustainable budget constraints and expenditure controls have been effective in limiting total expenditure. In addition, the budget process has become more transparent, and accountability has been improved. Core public sector reform has advanced at a slower pace. While the number of civil servants has remained broadly stable in recent years, some progress has been made with the devolution of responsibilities to line departments, in particular for personnel and fmancial management. Department heads and their deputies have been placed on performance-based contracts and are assessed in relation to budget outputs and other performance criteria. Decentralization of fmancial responsibilities has included greater autonomy for line departments to shift funds between expenditure categories, and a test with revenue retention arrangements. While achievements to date have made the public sector more effective and accountable, the authorities are determined to make further headway with public sector reforms. High on the government’s agenda are plans to forcefully continue with the privatization and corporatization program, to further reduce non-core government activities, and to accelerate progress with devolving a wider range of personnel and financial responsibilities to line departments. As part of the Public Service Commission’s Institutional Strengthening Program each department is currently being reviewed to determine the government’s core functions, the right structure of public service, and the proper allocation of human resources. The review is well underway and is expected to be completed by 2002. On the basis of the outcomes of the review, the government will determine the appropriate number of government departments and civil servants. ’ Asian Development Bank, 2000, Samoa 2000: Building on Recent Reforms, (Manila: AsDB).

Import growth will decline somewhat following the deceleration of domestic demand growth, but the trade deficit will nevertheless widen. The capital account is expected to improve as a result of lower repayments of government- guaranteed debt2 The overall balance is projected to be in surplus in 2001, yielding a comfortable reserve position of about 6 months of imports of goods and services at year end. 15. Barring any weather-related shocks, the main risks to the near-term outlook seem manageable. Although the economic outlook for partner countries has become more uncertain, a modest further slowdown in external demand growth relative to the staff’s baseline scenario is not likely to have a major impact on GDP growth, because of Samoa’s small export base. To the extent that a global slowdown would be combined with a reduction in private transfers, however, the impact on the economy could be more severe. On the domestic side, the near-term outlook assumes favorable weather conditions and macroeconomic policies that contain domestic demand growth at a sustainable level. However, a looser macroeconomic policy stance could trigger a stronger pick up in inflation and a weaker current account. To the extent that this would lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate, the government’s external debt obligations would increase in local currency terms, putting further pressure on the budget. In the absence of surges in domestic demand, though, Samoa’s external vulnerability seems manageable with a favorable current account position (including transfers), a moderate debt service ratio, and a comfortable level of gross international reserves (Table 5). 16. Over the medium term, real GDP growth is projected to ease to 4 percent per year, as the stimulatory impact of the government’s developments projects winds down, and private and official transfers gradually decline as a percentage of GDP. Private transfers are projected to increase in absolute terms over the medium term, but at a slower rate than nominal GDP. Official transfers are likely to begin to decline over the medium term as Samoa reaches higher stages of economic development. The reduction in official transfers is reflected in the staff’s medium-term fiscal projection, in which the lower grant receipts are largely offset by higher tax revenue, yielding a gradual consolidation of the fiscal balance (excluding grants). 2 The government has almost fully repaid the debt of SAT80 million it assumed after the sharp deterioration in the financial position of Polynesian Airlines in 1993/94.

The discussions focused on how best to maintain macroeconomic stability while ensuring sustained long-term growth. In light of economic conditions, the staff team urged the authorities to tighten the macroeconomic policy stance and to move ahead forcefully with the structnral reform program. A. Macroeconomic Policies Near-Term Fiscal Policy 18. The staff team raised concerns about the widening of the fiscal deficit in 2000/01. The original 2000/01 budget targeted a widening of the fiscal deficit (including grants) to 3% percent of GDP, largely on account of higher development spending and conservative growth and revenue projections. The further widening of the deficit to 3% percent of GDP in the revised 2000/01 budget, which reflects additional expenditure in part related to the elections earlier this year, would give rise to a significant domestic financing requirement. The staff team cautioned that such a fiscal easing at the time of an economic upswing runs the risk of overheating the economy, thereby endangering price stability and the level of foreign reserves. 19. The staff team recommended reducing expenditure and saving any excess revenue to keep the deficit at or below the lower end of the government’s medium-term target of 3-3% percent of GDP. With actual GDP growth significantly higher than originally anticipated, staff estimates suggest that excess tax revenue is likely to be substantial enough to bring the deficit down to the government’s medium-term target (Table 3, last column). However, to the extent that there was a possibility that excess revenue might not sufficiently offset the increase in the fiscal deficit caused by higher spending in the run-up to the elections, the staff team urged the authorities to identify areas for expenditure cuts. Expenditure could be contained by a stricter prioritization of development projects and by limiting current expenditure, in particular wage and salary payments, which appear to have increased by more than the 5 percent general wage increase announced in the original 2000/01 budget3 The authorities replied that they were willing to take the necessary steps to prevent the deficit from exceeding 3% percent of GDP, subject to approval by the new government. Medium-Term Fiscal Policy 20. The authorities’ medium-term fiscal objective is to maintain surpluses on the current balance and to allow overall deficits of up to 3-3% percent of GDP for externally financed development projects. The staff team noted that for the near-term, an externally-financed fiscal deficit at the lower end of the medium-term target of 3-3s percent 3 It seems that considerable wage drift is contributing to an increase in wage and salary payments in excess of the 5 percent general pay rise. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- could be justified given the scope for development projects in Samoa, and that such a deficit would not immediately threaten macroeconomic stability. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to bring the fiscal balance down gradually over the medium-term to closer to zero to ensure that the ratio of public debt to GDP continues to be reduced from its present level. In addition, by avoiding recourse to domestic financing of the deficit the government would leave sufficient room for private sector credit growth without the risk of generating inflationary pressures. To the extent the deficit is financed with concessional external loans for development projects, the risk of inflation is generally moderate as these projects tend to have a high import content, but the authorities should nevertheless aim to continue reducing Samoa’s already sizeable public debt relative to GDP to keep debt repayments at manageable levels. The staff team provided the authorities with a medium-term scenario that showed a broadly balanced overall budget, and a decline in the level of public debt from currently 62 percent of GDP to 40 percent of GDP, a level that is broadly similar to that of other small island economies in the region. The authorities indicated that they were in broad agreement with the thrust of the staff’s medium-term scenario and acknowledged the need for replenishing the government’s net position with the banking system. 21. Fiscal consolidation is also needed to reduce dependency on offkial transfers. As Samoa reaches higher stages of economic development, it is likely that access to foreign aid will be reduced. This prospect underlines the need for moving ahead more forcefully with the structural reform program (see below), increasing revenue through a broadening of the tax base-to include a larger part of subsistence agriculture and fishing-and a higher value- added goods and services tax (VAGST) rate, and achieving a stricter prioritization of development projects that are not financed with external grants. The authorities agreed that there is a need for fiscal consolidation over the medium term. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 22. The authorities stated that they stood ready to tighten monetary policy if signs of inflation or balance of payments pressures were to appear. The staff team noted that it was somewhat puzzling that despite strong money and credit growth in recent years, inflation has remained low, and expressed concern that this situation might not persist. The authorities pointed to financial deepening due to the liberalization of the financial sector as a possible explanation, but they agreed with the staff team that lags in the relationship between money and prices could not be excluded, which would suggest a build-up of risks, both to price stability and the balance of payments. 23. Given uncertainties about the monetary transmission channels, the staff team recommended an early monetary policy response in case inflationary or balance of payments pressures emerge. Since the adoption of indirect monetary management in 1998 in the context of financial sector reform, monetary transmission channels have changed, but Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-ll- they have not been fully tested yet (Box 3). It is, therefore, possible that to stem inflation larger interest rate adjustments may be needed than before the liberalization of interest rates. The authorities indicated that they might not be able to fully exclude the use direct instruments as a measure of last resort, should indirect monetary management fail to deliver the required results. The staff team noted that such a step could be avoided by early action when needed. 24. The staff team and the authorities agreed that the current exchange rate policy has served the economy well. The tala is pegged to a basket of currencies of Samoa’s main trading partners. The CBS buys and sells tala in the market at predetermined rates around the basket peg, which it can change within a margin of up to 2 percent; the last adjustment took place in 1998. In recent years, the real effective exchange rate has been broadly stable, and the authorities agreed with the staff team that the current exchange rate policy had provided an appropriate degree of competitiveness. B. Structural Reforms Public Sector Reform 25. Notwithstanding considerable progress in recent years, the staff team emphasized that public sector reform should remain a policy priority in Samoa. The authorities agreed with the staff team, but noted that the pace of reform in Samoa had to recognize the limited absorptive capacity of a small island economy. While social policies could help cushion the impact of reforms, the private sector will have to absorb most of the personnel and activities that are shed by the government. It is, therefore, important that reforms progress in line with the private sector’s capacity to expand its role in the economy. 26. The staff team urged the authorities to move ahead vigorously with the privatization program. The efficiency of the stat-wned enterprise (SOE) sector has improved, but many individual SOEs remain dependent on substantial capital injections from the budget. Large loss-making enterprises, such as the Electric Power Company and the Samoa Water Authority, continue to receive sizeable capital injections, totaling about 4 percent of GDP. The staff team urged the authorities to move ahead forcefully with dissolving or privatizing SOEs, while introducing more commercial and performance based management for the remaining enterprises. In addition, the authorities need to receive more comprehensive financial and other relevant information from SOEs and, as shareholders, should be involved in key decisions, both for economic and governance reasons. The staff team expressed particular concern about the state-owned airline’s decision for a sizeable fleet expansion and the apparent lack of transparency with regard to the airline’s investments, issues that had created major budgetary problems in the early 1990s. The authorities recognized the risks and said they intended to monitor the airline very closely. 27. The authorities acknowledged limited progress in implementing civil service reforms. Capacity constraints in line departments had contributed to delays in the implementation of reforms, the impact of which did not materialize until 1999.

Samoa: Financial Sector Reform For a long time, monetary policy in Samoa had been conducted with direct controls, in particular credit ceilings and interest rate controls. The rigid and non market-oriented character of such policy instruments hampered competition in the banking sector and risk-based pricing. On January 1,1998 a major reform of monetary operations took place: direct controls were abolished and replaced by market-based policy instruments. In particular, the main monetary policy instrument became the auction of newly introduced central bank bills (the Samoan banking system is in a positive net position vis-a-vis the central bank). In addition, the liquid asset requirement was lowered from 25 to 20 percent in January 1998, and gradually lowered further until it was fully abolished in September 1999. The Asian Development Bank provided a loan to assist the authorities in absorbing the cost of this operation. A statutory reserve requirement - set at 5 percent of deposits - remained in place. From mid-1998, commercial banks were allowed to make forward exchange contracts, and the levy of 1 percent on foreign exchange sales was removed at the beginning of 1999. These changes in the policy and structural environment within which banks operate had major implications for the functioning of the institutions and markets. As a result of these developments and the growth of the economy, credit to the private sector has grown rapidly in recent years and banks have generally done well. The elimination of direct controls has enabled them to increase their credit market share vis-a-vis nonbank financial institutions. The two largest banks, which are majority-owned by major financial institutions in Australia and New Zealand, are clearly profitable and well capitalized. The third, domestically owned bank is also profitable and complies with Samoa’s relatively stringent 15 percent capital adequacy requirement. The banks are currently making sizeable investments in new technology (ATMs, EFTPOS, etc.). Financial liberalization seems to have had a stronger impact on volumes 16.0 - 16.0 Interest rate structure (credit and money growth) than on (In percent) prices (interest rate structure). Prior to Lending rate the financial sector reforms, there were 12.0 - J -- 12.0 maximum lending and minimum deposit rates. The abolition of these controls was thought to lead to higher lending rates and 8.0 _ -- 8.0 lower deposit rates. The weighted- average lending rate jumped up right after Deposit rate he deregulation from 12 to 13 percent, ..---- .I.. I----.. . . ..-.- - -- . . . . . 3ut since then it has gradually declined to 4.0 4.0 iust above 12 percent. The average se 19 ,@ deposit rate showed little impact from the 8 :limination of controls. Since mid-1999, the rate has been coming down somewhat. All in ah, while :redit has grown rapidly since the liberalization, its impact on interest rates has been modest, and ;preads continue to be relatively high at levels around 7.5 percent. This can at least in part be mributed to the small size of the Samoan financial market and limited number of players in that narket; no new banking licenses have been issued since the establishment of the National Bank of Samoa in 1995. At the same time, the liberalization of interest rates has enabled the banking sector to nore adequately reflect elements of risk in the price of their credits. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13- team stressed that a leaner civil service should be a key priority as it would help reduce costs and create more room for expenditure on high priority areas, such as health, education, and infrastructure development, especially in light of the potential decline in official transfers over the medium-term. The authorities said they expected the Public Service Commission’s Institutional Strengthening Program, aimed at determining the core functions of the government and the appropriate allocation of human resources, to contribute to slimming down the civil service to an efficient size. Financial Sector Issues 28. The staff team emphasized there is a need for a further strengthening of prudential supervision. The CBS is responsible for prudential supervision of the three licensed banks that are currently operating in Samoa. The two largest banks are majority- owned by large financial institutions in Australia and New Zealand and have a joint market share of over 90 percent. The banks are unlikely to constitute a systemic risk as they are well capitalized and profitable. The third, domestically-owned, bank is also profitable and in compliance with Samoa’s rather stringent 15 percent capital adequacy requirement. However, the staff team expressed concern that an economic slowdown could have major implications for the domestically-owned bank and the nonbank financial institutions, particularly in light of recent rapid credit growth. The CBS emphasized that it had taken steps to strengthen its supervisory capabilities, including the introduction of on-site inspections of banks and efforts to comply with the Base1 Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. 29. The staff team welcomed the recent adoption of an amendment to the Financial Institutions Act placing nonbank financial institutions under the supervision of the CBS. These institutions-especially the National Provident Fund and the Development Bank of Samoa-play a major role in Samoa’s financial markets and compete directly with the banks, in particular in the credit markets. Problems in these financial institutions would have major implications for confidence in and stability of the financial system at large. The staff team urged the CBS to rapidly develop and introduce a system to supervise these institutions, and to request technical assistance in this area as needed. 30. The authorities have taken steps to improve tbe quality of oversight and regulation of Samoa’s Offshore Financial Center (OFC) (Box 4). In April 2000, the Financial Stability Forum included Samoa in Group III of its classification system of OFCs, implying a low quality of supervision, a lack of cooperation with onshore supervisors, and little or no attempt being made to adhere to international standards. The authorities expressed their discontent with this classification. They have recently undertaken a review of Samoa’s offshore legislation, and concrete proposals to amend the 1987 Offshore Banking Act in order to bring the regulatory and supervisory framework more into line with international standards have been sent to Parliament. In June 2000, the Samoan Parliament adopted a law aimed at restricting money laundering activities. In accordance with the new law, an anti- money laundering authority has been established within the CBS, and Samoa joined the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). In addition, Samoa has applied to become Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- an observer to the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors (OGBS), and in this context Samoa was evaluated jointly by the OGBS and the APG in February 2001. The staff team welcomed these steps and noted their advantages for the country’s image in this area. Box 4. Samoa: Offshore Financial Center Samoa is a relatively small offshore jurisdiction. It has a handful of offshore banks and insurance companies. Its most significant offshore activity is the incorporation of about ~ 4,500 international business companies. About 80 percent of the offshore business conducted through Samoa comes from the Asia-Pacific region, due in part to the convenience of the time zone and the option of incorporating companies in Chinese characters. During the past two years, Samoa has been upgrading its regulatory and supervisory practices. One indication of change is that the number of offshore banks has declined from 25 to 9. The importance of the OFC for the Samoan economy is roughly estimated to be about 1 percent of GDP. The authorities have undertaken a review of the offshore legislation and concrete proposals to amend the 1987 Offshore Banking Act in order to bring the regulatory and supervisory framework more in line with international standards have been sent to Parliament. In addition, Samoa recently became a member of the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering, applied to become an observer to the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors, and adopted anti-money laundering legislation. C. Trade and Investment Policies 31. Since the tariff reforms in 1998 and 1999, the maximum tariff rate has remained at 20 percent, which is high in light of the commitment of Samoa’s APEC trading partners to achieve free trade by 2010 and Samoa’s intention to accede to the WTO. While acknowledging that the average tariff rate is only about 12 percent, the staff team encouraged the authorities to move ahead with further tariff reductions and noted that the fall in revenue could be offset by a broadening of the tax base and a higher VAGST rate. The authorities agreed with the staff team on the need for a further reduction in tariff rates over the medium term, but stressed that offsetting revenues would first have to be ensured before tariff rates would be lowered further. The staff team supported Samoa’s decision to apply for accession to the WTO. 32. Constraints to private sector growth and investment need to be addressed. Although tax and tariff reforms have contributed to a more favorable business environment in Samoa, the limited availability of free-hold land has continued to be an impediment to investment and growth, in particular to the development of the tourism industry (Box 5). The staff team urged the authorities to take further measures to increase the supply of land available for economic activity. Samoa’s system of price controls was changed in 1999 with a maximum percentage markup replacing fixed price setting, and a more than 50 percent reduction in the number of items subject to price ceilings. The staff team recommended the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - Box 5. Samoa: Land Issues Samoa consists of nine islands in the South Pacific. The two largest islands are Upolu and Savai’i, and Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located in Upolu. The total land area of Samoa is approximately 700,000 acres. The customary land tenure system in Samoa refers to the communal use of land with title vested in the matai or chief of a village. Communal land covers 81 percent of the total land area and though its sale is prohibited, long-term leasing of customary land is permitted. Public land comprises of 15 percent of total land and the remaining 4 percent is freehold land. The customary land tenure arrangement is a major constraint to private sector investment and growth in Samoa. It impedes the development of commercial agriculture and hinders access to credit as the communal nature of property precludes its use as collateral for bank financing. The arrangement is also an obstacle to the expansion of the tourist industry, particularly since approximately 98 percent of coastal land is customary land resulting in a scarcity of prime sites for hotel construction. The Samoa Land Corporation (SLC) has led efforts to address the issue of access to land for commercial activity. The SLC was established in 1990 and is managed by a board chaired by the Minister of Lands. The main objective of the SLC is to provide public land for sale or lease in order to support private sector investment and growth. The SLC administers 24,000 acres of public land. This land was previously held by the Samoa Trust Estates Corporation (STEC) in trust for the people of Samoa and transferred to the government, to be managed by the SLC, under the Western Samoa Trust Estates Reconstruction Act of 1990. The SLC provides 49+49 year land leases for agricultural purposes and 15 year leases for industrial uses. In recent years, the corporation has offered around 865 acres of land in Apia for sale for residential development. However, the disposition of land has been slow, primarily due to problems with the auction as the minimum bid price set by the government proved to be too high. Furthermore, there have been boundary disputes with villagers and difficulties with squatters. In addition, the Trade, Commerce and Industry Amendment Act of 1994 authorizes the Department of Trade, Commerce and Industry to negotiate leases on customary land. Under this legislation, the Department of Trade, Commerce and Industry can act on behalf of a beneficial owner of customary land, negotiate leases (typically up to 30 years), take ahead- lease on the land and sub-lease land for hotel or industrial purposes.

Moreover, as many of the price ceilings do not seem to be binding at the moment, this would be the appropriate time to abandon the system.4 The authorities agreed with the staff team’s assessment, but provided no timeframe for the elimination of the remaining price restrictions. Other impediments to investment include the supply of both water and electricity, and the quality of telecommunication services. D. Economic Statistics and Other Issues 33. Substantial progress has been made in improving the quality of economic statistics, but several deficiencies continue to hamper effective surveillance. The CPI has recently been rebased and new weights have been assigned according to the 1997 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The Business Activity Survey conducted in 2000 will be utilized to revise and improve the quality of national accounts, and the staff team endorsed the authorities’ intention to compile expenditure-based national accounts within the next two years. In the compilation of government finance statistics the classification of current and development expenditures is not in accordance with the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) format. The authorities indicated that they intend to request technical assistance to resolve this problem. Furthermore, the authorities are working towards meeting the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) standards. Currently, most data series are available, but timely submission of the data cannot be guaranteed yet. 34. The staff team recommended improved coordination between the CBS and the Treasury and Customs Departments in the compilation of BOP statistics. Timely and reliable BOP data is of vital importance for an economy dependent on the external sector. The staff team, therefore, strongly suggested improved coordination among the relevant departments as well as compilation of more disaggregated BOP statistics, such as a detailed breakdown of imports and separate reporting of private capital flows. The staff team recommended the CBS adopt the fifth edition of the BOP manual. V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 35. Recent economic developments in Samoa have been largely favorable. High growth rates have been combined with low inflation, a broadly stable real effective exchange rate, and a current account surplus. Favorable weather conditions and the benefits from years of continued structural reforms have supported the robust economic performance. 36. However, the recent economic expansion has been combined with-and to some extent supported by-an accommodative stance of monetary policy and increasing fiscal deficits. As a result, public sector debt is quite high by regional standards and credit and money have been growing at high rates. This has, so far, not resulted in inflationary 4 The removal of more than half of the goods from the price control list in 1999 did not give rise to monopolistic behavior, shortages, or inflation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- pressures, but there has been an increasing demand for imports which together with the current abundant liquidity in the economy poses a risk to macroeconomic stability. 37. Measures aimed at economic development and growth will need to be combined with effective macroeconomic stabilization policies. This will require an integrated approach, focusing at the same time on a forceful continuation of structural reforms, corrective fiscal policies aimed at curbing the recent rise of the deficit, and a preparedness to tighten monetary policy if signs of inflation or balance of payments pressures emerge. Such a combined strategy will also be key to reducing the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks. 38. The authorities are urged to find offsetting measures to keep tbe 2000/01 fiscal deficit at or below the lower end of the official medium-term target of 3-3% percent of GDP. This could be achieved through a combination of a stricter prioritization of development projects, limiting current expenditure, and saving any excess revenue. For the medium term, the staff recommends a broadly balanced budget to ensure that public debt remains on a declining path relative to GDP and to leave sufficient room for private sector development. The staff also advises the authorities to consider a moderate increase in the VAGST rate and a broadening of the tax base, which would contribute to both limiting the government’s borrowing requirement and reducing the dependency of the budget on foreign aid. 39. The staff recommends an early monetary policy response in case inflationary or balance of payments pressures emerge. As monetary transmission channels have not been fully tested since the 1998 financial sector reforms, an early response would be warranted to avoid having to return to direct monetary instruments as a measure of last resort in case indirect monetary management does not immediately produce the desired results. 40. The staff considers that the current exchange rate regime has served the economy well. The real effective exchange rate has been broadly stable in recent years, and has provided an appropriate degree of competitiveness. 41. Structural reforms remain key to further growth. The staff urges the authorities to move ahead forcefully with the reform program, while acknowledging that the pace of reform in Samoa should be seen in light of the absorptive capacity of domestic institutions in a small island economy. Priority should be given to privatizing SOEs and introducing more performance-based management for the remaining SOEs. In addition, the authorities need to receive comprehensive and timely information from SOEs in order to be able to assess key developments and management decisions, both for economic and governance reasons. Another key area is civil service reform, as a leaner civil service would help reduce costs and create more room for expenditure on health, education, and infrastructure development, especially with a view to reducing dependency on official transfers. 42. The staff urges the authorities to work towards removing the remaining price restrictions and to increase access to land for economic activity. price controls do not Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- seem to be binding at the moment, but could introduce distortions in the future. The limited availability of free-hold land as well as the narrow scope for the utilization of customary land as collateral for bank loans are impediments to investment and growth, in particular to the development of the tourist sector. 43. Oversight of the financial sector needs to be strengthened to be able to keep up with major structural changes in this sector in recent years. The majority of the banking system is foreign-owned, highly profitable and well capitalized. However, an economic slowdown would have major implications for the system, particularly in light of the recent credit growth. Further improvements in supervision and compliance with international standards in this area are highly recommended. In addition, there is an urgent need for the CBS to rigorously implement its new authority to supervise and regulate the activities of the nonbank financial institutions, as problems in these institutions would have major implications for confidence in and stability of the financial system at large. Regional cooperation and technical assistance could help in building the necessary capacity in this area. 44. The staff welcomes the significant steps the authorities recently took, in line with international recommendations, to improve the oversight of the OFC to bring the regulatory and supervisory system more into line with international standards. In light of the limited size of the OFC activities, the economic implications of a tightening of the rules and regulations will be minimal, while there will be important benefits attached to an improvement of the country’s image in this area. 45. The authorities have made substantial progress in improving the quality of economic statistics, but several deficiencies continue to hamper effective surveillance. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to compile expenditure based national accounts within the next two years and to work towards submitting data according to the GDDS. The authorities urgently need to establish a system for the appropriate classification of current and development expenditures in the budget according to the GFS format. In addition, the staff recommends improved coordination between the CBS and the Treasury and Customs Departments in the compilation of BOP statistics, as well as compilation of more disaggregated BOP statistics, and the adoption of the fifth edition of the BOP manual. 46. It is proposed that Samoa continue on the 24-month cycle for the next Article IV consultation.

In addition, the projections assume absence of adverse weather conditions. For fiscal policy, it is assumed that the current budget deficit will be reined in and that the government’s deposits with the banking system will be replenished. On the basis of information obtained in discussions with representatives of the donor community, official grants are projected to increase slightly in the near term. However, for the outer years official transfers are projected to gradually edge down as Samoa reaches higher stages of economic development. To consolidate the fiscal deficit the government will need to gradually reduce current expenditure by about 1 percent of GDP, and increase revenue by 2% percent of GDP over the medium term. The decline in expenditure may be realized through efficiency gains from civil service reform. The increase in revenue can be achieved through a broadening of the tax base and/or a modest increase in the VAGST rate. The proposed fiscal policy will allow the government to broadly maintain development expenditure at its current high level and at the same time to rebuild its deposits with the banking system, leaving enough room for private sector credit growth. For monetary policy, it is assumed that gross foreign reserves will be maintained at a level of about 6 months import cover, and that inflation will be kept below the official target rate of 3 percent. Growth in money aggregates can slow down to 6-7 percent per year as nominal economic activity eases and the pace financial deepening is assumed to decline somewhat as the economy matures. The projected money supply should be sufficient to finance private sector development, especially in light of the government’s declining domestic borrowing requirement. On the external side, it is assumed that Samoa’s economy will grow faster than the economies of its main trading partners and that private transfers will increase by enough to offset the decline in official transfers in the outer years. As a result, the trade deficit will widen as imports grow faster than exports, while the invisibles balances will increase somewhat. Net official foreign borrowing will be slightly negative, reflecting the net repayment of foreign debt. The overall balance will show a small surplus, enough to keep gross foreign reserves at the targeted level of 6 months import cover. This scenario supports a gradual easing of GDP growth with the return to normal levels of economic activity over the medium term as construction activity levels off from a high in 2000. Inflation will be slightly higher than in recent years as the decline in agricultural prices appears to have bottomed out, while import prices are projected to edge up.

Up to 1999, 26 loans totaling US$97.4 million for 23 projects and technical assistance totaling US$16.0 million for 65 projects have been provided. The AsDB has been the largest source of loans to the country and almost half of Samoa’s outstanding public external debt is accounted for by AsDB loans. AsDB’s strategy of assistance to Samoa is to support the Government’s reform measures, which are aimed at making the economy more private enterprise based and competitively structured. The AsDB will continue to support public sector reform, liberalization of the financial sector, promotion of private sector-led growth, corporatizing and privatizing state- owned enterprises, improving the management of power and infrastructure facilities, and addressing inefficiencies in education, including skills development. One loan was approved in 1998 for the financial sector program amounting to US$7.5 million and three TA grants were approved in the same year for a total of US$2 million. No loan was approved in 1999. However, five TA grants were approved in 1999 in the energy, education, and finance sectors for a total of US$1.3 million.

Deficiencies, however, continue to hamper effective surveillance and more needs to be done to improve the quality and coverage of statistics, especially in the areas of the balance of payments and government finance. Upgrading the quality of the data would require sustained and well-coordinated technical assistance over a period of time and, more importantly, commitment from the authorities to allocate adequate resources. Real sector The only up to date real sector data reported for publication in IFS are the consumer price index (CPI) and the values of exports and imports. In addition, IFS publishes the index of manufacturing production and GDP volume at 1995 prices. Official national accounts from 1994 to mid-1998 became available in late 1998, following technical assistance under an Asian Development Bank program. Quarterly and annual GDP estimates have since then been developed on a production basis (broken down by the standard industrial classification (SIC)) and are compiled in both nominal and real terms. Estimates are available within two to three months after the end of each quarter. During the last few years a number of initiatives have contributed to an improvement in the quality and reliability of national accounts statistics. The 1997 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) and the 1998 Agriculture Census were utilized to revise estimates of agriculture and fishing. A multiple approach to measuring construction activity was adopted for 2000, and the Business Activity Survey conducted in 2000 will be used to revise 1998,1999 and 2000 national accounts. The authorities have also expressed their intention to report expenditure-side national accounts within the next two years. Ongoing efforts, however, are needed to further improve the quality and coverage of the accounts. In particular, data available on the activities of the automotive parts plant are of poor quality and more comprehensive information should be obtained. The CPI was rebased on the results of the 1997 H.IES. In addition to revised weights, some expenditure items were deleted and new items added in order to better reflect current consumption patterns. The Alcohol and Tobacco component index was separated from the Miscellaneous index to enable better tracking. Furthermore, the CPI is now released monthly rather than quarterly. Monthly employment statistics from 1994 onwards were first compiled in 1998 utilizing data collected by the National Provident Fund (the compulsory pension fund, which collects contributions from employees and all employers on behalf of workers in the formal sector). The data includes wages and the number of persons employed by industry and gender.

Government finance Weaknesses in the compilation and reporting of government finance statistics (GFS) have posed serious problems for macroeconomic policy analysis and monitoring in the past. Recently, the Treasury Department has made efforts to present the data in accordance with the GFS format, but data quality is hampered by difficulties in identifying intragovernment transfers and misclassification of accounts, particularly net lending and external grants, and current and development expenditure. GFS data have not been reported since 1985, but the authorities plan to resume reporting in the near future. While fiscal data provided to the staff team reflected notable improvements, technical assistance in GFS compilation is needed to ensure both that transaction classification and data compilation procedures are consistent with international standards. Monetary statistics Comprehensive data on the monetary sector are published in the quarterly Central Bank of Samoa Bulletin. Data for the accounts of the Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) and the deposit money banks and interest rates are reported to the Fund for publication in ZI;s on a regular and timely basis. In view of the significant role of other banking institutions in extending loans to the private sector, the compilation of a banking survey would improve the analytical usefulness of the monetary statistics. The CBS has started compiling the relevant data on a monthly basis for large institutions and on a quarterly basis for all other institutions. The staff encourages the CBS to start reporting the banking survey data to the Fund as soon as technically possible. The monetary survey has showed a significant increase in other items net, in part because of misclassification of foreign currency deposits held by residents. The CBS is urged to address this problem and to revise the monetary data accordingly. Balance of payments Annual and quarterly balance of payments data are regularly published in the quarterly CBS Bulletin and annual data are reported for publication by the Fund in the IFS and Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. While data reported for the current account are fairly comprehensive, the data published for the financial account are limited to elements of Other Investment (loan liabilities of the government and monetary authorities), and incomplete data on bank transactions and repayments on long-term loans received by the private sector. No data are published on Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, and other private sector financial transactions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - ANNEXV The CBS is also urged to change the classification of official grants from the capital account to the current account, and to work towards resolving the mismatch between grant-financed imports and official grants. In recent years, PFTAC has been providing technical assistance in order to improve the quality of statistics; the latest mission was in September 1998. The staff has recommended closer coordination between the CBS and the Treasury Department (the agency responsible for compiling external debt statistics, grant aid, and other international transactions of the government) to improve the quality and accuracy of financial account data. The staff has also recommended changes in existing BOP compilation practices so that more reliable data can be generated, including requiring banks to report more accurate data. Of special concern is the exclusion from Samoa’s current BOP statistics of significant overseas investments of nonbank financial institutions. In addition, improvements are needed for foreign direct investments and the commercial banks’ reporting on their customers’ transactions. The tourism survey, which travel receipt estimates are based on, was last conducted in 1996 and needs to be updated in the near future.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Samoa On May, 9,2001, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Samoa.’ Background Recent economic developments in Samoa have been largely favorable. Since a number of mainly weather related shocks in the early 199Os, which reduced domestic output and income, a consistent policy aimed at a combination of macroeconomic stability and structural reforms has resulted in a remarkable pick-up in growth in recent years, while inflation has remained low. Real GDP growth is estimated to have risen from 3% percent in 1998 to 5% percent in 1999 and 6% percent in 2000. The strong growth performance in 1999 was fueled by a pick up in construction activity and a strong performance of the tourist sector, which benefited from celebrations of the new millennium and a number of large international meetings. The recovery in the agricultural sector and a continued sharp pick up in private and public construction activity contributed to the further acceleration of GDP growth in 2000. In spite of the strong growth in demand, consumer price inflation remained low in 1999 (% percent) and 2000 (1 percent). Lower prices of local agricultural produce offset higher import prices for fuel and building materials. The external current account surplus (including transfers) declined from 7 percent of GDP in 1999 to 3% percent of GDP in 2000, largely on account of higher imports and lower private remittances, but the level of gross international reserves has remained l Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the May, 9,200l Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

The worsening of the current account was partly offset by larger official loan disbursements than in 1999. External debt at end-2000 is estimated to have declined further to 62 percent of GDP, which is still high compared to other islands in the region. The debt-service ratio, which has been low given the concessionary nature of most of the debt, remained at 12% percent of exports of goods and services in 2000. Samoa has maintained its international competitiveness, as reflected by a real effective exchange rate that has been broadly stable over the past two years. After the small devaluation of the tala against the currency basket in the wake of the Asian crisis, the real value of the tala in terms of the U.S. dollar has moved broadly in line with other currencies in the region. The decline in export volumes in 1999 and 2000 was due to a slowdown, and finally a halt, in coconut oil and copra exports following the closure of Samoa’s coconut oil mill. After four consecutive years of surpluses, the overall fiscal balance (including grants) moved into deficit in 1999100. The main factor explaining the turnaround was the sizeable decline in external grants. Nevertheless, the actual deficit in 1999/00 (% percent of GDP) was smaller than projected in the budget (3 percent of GDP), due to the temporary delay of some development expenditure and a slight reduction in current expenditure. The 2000/01 budget envisages a further widening of the fiscal deficit to 3% percent of GDP, reflecting the carry- forward of the development expenditures (including large co-payments on external infrastructure loans), short-run costs related to the privatization program, and conservative revenue estimates. Monetary policy has been accommodative. Money supply increased sharply in both 1999 and 2000, while key interest rates were lowered in April 2000. The major contributor to broad money growth was domestic credit, which has risen sharply since the financial reforms of 1998. Annual growth in credit to the private sector was close to 20 percent in 1999 and 2000, with the trade and construction sectors accounting for most of the new lending. The government also contributed to the process of monetary expansion, as it drew down its deposits with the banking system for the first time since 1994. Public sector reform has continued in 1999 and 2000, most notably with the sale of government majority shareholdings and the corporatization of the Post and Telecommunications Department. However, civil service reform-which includes the transfer of responsibilities for financial and human resource management to line departments, implementation of performance-based management, and the reduction in the number of civil servants-is progressing slower than anticipated.
