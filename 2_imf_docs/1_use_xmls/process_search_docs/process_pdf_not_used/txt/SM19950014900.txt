Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Paraguay were held in Asuncion during May 3-13, 1995. I/ In the last consultation, concluded on April 15, 1994 (EBM/94/35), Directors generally commended the authorities for their prudent financial policies and continued progress in implementing structural reforms, but expressed concern about rising inflation and urged the authorities to observe wage restraint in the public sector, curb the growth of current expenditure, and control the pace of monetary expansion. They also stressed the need to strengthen banking supervision. The quality of data in Paraguay is poor for surveillance purposes. The national accounts are weak; the accounts of the central government are reasonably timely and accurate, but the accounts of the Social Security Institute (IPS) and state enterprises are deficient; banking data are improperly sectorized and incomplete (reportedly banks maintain a large volume of transactions "off the books"); and, except for data on public debt and reserves, the external sector accounts are unreliable owing to the large nonregistered trade with neighboring countries (see Appendix III). Paraguay's relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendix I and II. II. Recent Developments 1. Macroeconomic performance a. Developments through 1994 Since the overthrow of the Stroessner dictatorship in 1989, Paraguay has implemented wide-ranging political and economic reforms. On the political side, the reforms culminated in the first democratically elected government and civilian President in over 40 years, in May 1993. On the economic side, they included unification of the exchange rate; financial sector liberalization; reform of the tax system and tax administration; integration into MERCOSUR; and normalization of relations with external creditors, involving debt-reduction in some cases. The pace of structural adjustment has slowed somewhat recently, owing to a lack of political consensus. The quality of basic public sector services is poor, with Paraguay lagging far behind its neighbors in access to safe water and sanitation, education, telecommunications, paved roads, and electricity connections. Since 1990 real GDP growth has averaged 3 percent a year, barely keeping pace with population growth (Table 1). Real GDP grew by 3.5 percent 1/ The mission comprised Messrs. Hardy (head), Dunn, Jaramillo and Ramlogan (all WHD), and Mrs. Ali (Assistant-WHD). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- :! - in 1994, compared with 4..L percent in 1993, reflecting poor agricultural production related to bad weather and pest infestation. The rate of infla- tion, which had risen from 12 percent in 1991 to over 20 percent in 1993 mainly as a result of a loosening in credit policy, declined to 18.3 percent in 1994, but was still above the authorities' target of 15 percent. Except in 1992, when there was a small. deficit associated with the clearing of external arrears, the nonfinanc:ial public sector has recorded substantial overall surpluses since 1959 (Table 2). The surplus rose to 1.8 percent of GDP in 199/+, from 1.3 percent in 1993, reflecting stronger outturns in the Central Government and IPS. Public sector savings averaged about 5 percent of GDP per year. Currant expenditures rose from 9 percent of GDP'in 1990 to 12.5 percent of GDP in 1994, as the government wage bill doubled to 6.2 .percent of GDP, with pensions accounting for another 1.7 per- cent of GDP in 1994. The increase in (current outlays in recent years was largely covered by a rise in tax and nontax revenues, from 14.2 percent of GDP in 1990 to 16.2 percent of GDP.in 1994, and by an improvement in the operating surplus of the public enterprises following major tariff adjust- ments in 1990. Public investment, including the state enterprises, averaged just over 3 percent of GDP a year during 1990-94, as investment budgets were consistently under-executed. This occurred despite ample availability of external financing and tariff increases in 1994 to help generate domestic counterpart funding. l/ Paraguay has a backlog of some US$700 million in approved but undisbursed loans from the World Bank and IDB. Taxation and tax rates are relatiTrely low. Tax revenues as a share of GDP have averaged about 11 percent in Paraguay in recent years as compared to about 20 percent in neighboring countries. There is no personal income tax, and the VAT rate is 10 percent. Social security and other taxes on labor amount to 25 percent, but are widely evaded. The corporate income tax rate is 30 percent, but is reduced to 1~0 percent if profits are reinvested 1/ As of end-1994, outstanding arrears on public external debt, by the national water company (CORPOSANA) and the Ministry of Defense, totaled just under US$15 million. Presently, CORPOSANA is in the process of clearing its arrears through a cash settlement, while the latter arises from a contract dispute over the construction of an arms factory during the Stroessner dictatorship. Iti November 1994, the notional electricity company (ANDE), reached an agreement with the Brazilian government to clear its outstanding obligations to the Itaipti binational entity for purchases of electricity in 1993-94, amounting to US$74 million. Under the agreement, ANDE was allowed to settle its debt the following year by purchasing Brazilian government paper at a discount. The arrangement >.pecifies that Brazil and ANDE would share in the savings from this operation. 'These arrears do not constitute exchange restrictions subject to Article VIII, since they do not arise from direct governmental interference with the availability of foreign exchange to make payments for current internatic,nal transactions or with the timely transfer of the proceeds of such transsctions.

The'low tax rates, narrow tax base, and weak tax administration have resulted in low tax collections relative to GDP. Collections rose to 10.7 percent of GDP in 1994,.from 9.3 percent of GDP in 1993, due to a strengthening of tax administration (especially in the customs office, which was reorganized during the year). Central government current expenditure rose to 11.4 percent of GDP in 1994, reflecting payments associated with the bankruptcy and privatization of the national airline, and increases in government wage rates and employment. Paraguay's external position has strengthened significantly in recent years: external public debt declined from USS2.01 billion at end-1988 to USS1.24 billion at end-1994 (15.8 percent of GDP), while official inter- national reserves rose from US$300 million to USS1.04 billion over the same period, including an increase of almost US$350 million in 1994 (Table 3). While it is difficult to analyze external sector developments because of the large volume of unrecorded trade and general unreliability of the data, the staff estimates that the external current account deficit remained at 3.9 percent of GDP, which was more than covered by private capital flows and a receipt of some US$70 million from the Itaipu binational entity in payment of its arrears to Paraguay. Export receipts rose by 13 percent in 1994, with nontraditional exports rising by about 45 percent. Direct foreign investment is estimated to have risen to some US$180 million or 2.3 percent of GDP in 1994. The debt service ratio fell to 15.4 percent in 1994. The strong inflow of foreign currency in 1994 presented the BCP with the task of preventing an excessive expansion of the money supply while avoiding an appreciation of the currency in real terms. The authorities attempted to moderate the growth of monetary aggregates through a higher than planned fiscal surplus and limited open-market operations. Neverthe- less, broad money (M3) increased by 24 percent and private sector-credit by 28 percent in 1994 (Table 4). Foreign currency deposits represented about two fifths of total bank deposits of 9 3,701 billion (25 percent of GDP) at end 1994. Prior to 1993, the surpluses of the IPS were kept in zero- interest deposits in the Central Bank, but since then, these deposits have been placed in the commercial banking system, mainly in financially weak local banks. By ,end 1994, these had grown to about 9 420 billion (2.8 per- cent of GDP). The BCP operates a managed float of the guarani, aimed broadly at main- taining the country's external competitiveness. During 1994 the guarani depreciated in nominal terms by only 5.3 percent against the U.S. dollar. In real effective terms the guarani depreciated by 5.5 percent, mainly as a result of the sharp real appreciation of the Brazilian currency in the second half of the year. Since 1991, the guarani has tended to depreciate in real effective terms, and remains relatively depreciated vis-a-vis its long-term average (Chart, Figure 11).

Developments during 1995 Economic growth is expected to pick up somewhat (to 4 percent) in 1995, largely because of improved agricultural production, which also will boost exports. By end-April 1995 the 12-month inflation rate had fallen to 14 percent, but following increases of 18-23 percent in water and electri-. city tariffs and of 15 percent in the minimum wage, effective May 1, further progress in reducing inflation will be.difficult. Tax collections continued to perf‘orm strongly in the first quarter of 1995, rising by over 50 percent compared with the same period of 1994. The public sector wage bill is set to rise by 27 percent in 1995, reflecting across-the-board increases of 10 percent in January and 5 percent in July, and.a special salary increase for the military. The Government also has agreed to set up a special commission to advise on the.feasibility of granting an additional nonprogrammed 5. per'cent across-the-board wage hike for government employees in July. As a result, the overall surplus of the NFPS is expected to decline to about 1 percent of GDP in 1995. During the first quarter of 1995, official reserves remained roughly unchanged, except for valuation gains. The guarani depreciated by 2 percent in nomin.al terms against the U.S. dollar, while domestic prices rose by 4.4 percent. A further increase in official reserves is projected for the year as a whole because of higher cotton and soybean crops, favorable external prices, heavy Brazilian demand for nontraditional exports and conttnued (though somewhat lower) capital inflows. 2. Structural reform A broad range of structural issues is being addressed by the current ' government, including tax reform, tax administration, privatization, pension and financial sector reforms. Hqwever , the pace of adjustment has been slow recently, as the government has had difficulty in mustering political support for reforms. This is particula.rly true for efforts to reform the banking laws and privatize state enterprises. 'The Central Bank Charter was finally passed in mid-May 1995, with some limits on the independence of the Central Bank, but Congress has not yet acted on a proposed general banking law. Paraguay has a large number, of banks and financial institutions (34 banks and 65 finance houses), many of which are undercapitalized and weakly managed, and are far from complying with internationally accepted prudential standards. Loans to insiders are also a problem, as there are no explicit limitations on this practice. Minimum capital requirements were raised in the past two years, but have not been aggressively enforced, and in November 1994 the BCP agreed to certain changes that weakened the capital requirement and allowed a five-year grace period for noncomplying banks to undertake provisioning resulting from the new system of loan classification.

The released resources were to be invested in central bank certificates. The authorities plan to lower the LRR to a uniform 10 percent over a period of several years. The national airline was privatized in 1994, but only after it had suffered severe losses and ceased operating. Progress has been made in preparing the steel, railway, alcohol, and shipping companies, for privatization: their sale was authorized in the December 1991 privatization bill. The Government has stated its intention to privatize, at least partially, the major enterprises--electricity, telephone, water and cement --but there is no authorization as yet from Congress to do so. An Industrial Development Fund, established in 1994 and administered by the Central Bank, channels resources from the World Bank, IDB, and bilateral sources through the commercial banking system to certain types of develop- ment projects. Studies have been made with IDB support to transfer health care responsibilities from the IPS to the Ministry of Health, and to make the IPS responsible for all pensions, including those of veterans and government workers. The setting up of private capitalized pension funds also is under study. Under the MERCOSUR agreement, tariffs on the 399 items on the list of exemptions from the common external tariff (CET), mainly capital goods and items destined for the re-export market (such as electronic goods), are to be raised gradually to the CET by January 2006, and tariffs on the 272 items exempted from intra-MERCOSUR free trade are to be gradually eliminated by 2001. This provides a fairly long transition period for Paraguay to adapt its economy. III. Summary of Discussions On present trends, the authorities believe that over the next few years Paraguay is likely to face inadequate per capita income growth, the emergence of a fiscal deficit, and an acceleration of inflation. The discussions centered on policies to step-up the GDP growth rate over the medium term and reduce inflation gradually to international levels, through eliminating backward wage indexation and better coordination of financial policies, structural reforms (especially privatization), and stepped up infrastructure investment. 1. Indexation mechanisms By law the minimum wage, which at some US$200 a month is relatively high by regional standards, must be reviewed whenever the accumulated increase in the CPI since the last adjustment reaches 10 percent. In Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - practice, this provision has been interpreted in a way that (as a.minimum) is tantamount to full backward indexation. The mission noted that,progress in reducing inflation would require tha,t future adjustments in the minimum wage, and in public sector wages in general, be made on the basis of programmed rather than past inflation. In this context the mission advised against any general increases in public sector wages 'beyond thk'budgeted level, as this would raise inflationary expectations. Public sector tariffs also should be,adjusted in the future according to programmed,inflation, while improving the efficiency of public enterprises to ensure that, their financial viability is not compromised.and their operating surpluses are maintained at an adequate level. 2. Fiscal policy The authorities agreed with the mission that tax administration should be strengthened further and current outlays restrained. The mission urged a temporary freeze on public sector hiring, and. a ,reduction in the public sector work force, to back up wage restraint. Over the medium term, current expenditure and employment needs to be reoriented to improve health, education, and infrastructure, and to attract be.tter qualified personnel. Spending on social and economic 'infrastructure is among the lowest in the Western Hemisphere relative to GDP, and deficiencies plainly exis,t. Over the medium term, the authorities agreed that Paraguay will need to increase tax revenues. To this effect, the mission encouraged the ' .' authorities to pursue a two-pronged approach: First, to strengthen tax administration by extending coverage of the newly created. large taxpayer unit and the automated information system for customs administration to the entire country, continuing training of tax administration personal, .and updating the cadastral,survey, among other FAD recommendations; and second, to broaden the tax base through implementatjon of the tax on presumptive agricultural income, the extension of VAT to agriculture and; possibly, the introduction of a personal income tax at a later stage. In order to encourage corporate saving and investment and to bolster Paraguay's competitiveness in MERCOSUR, the authorities are considering lowering the rate of the corporate income tax (which is currently the second largest source of tax revenue, yielding about 2 percent of GDP) from 30 per- cent to 25 percent next year, and gradually to 10 percent with,an additional 15 percent tax on distributed profits. At that stage, the existing special tax incentive schemes would be abolished. They expected'that these steps would help reduce evasion, but any revenue loss.would be covered by the reimposition of stamp taxes on financial and other transactions that were eliminated in mid-1994. The mission noted that low taxes give Paraguay a competitive advantage in MERCOSUR, but suggested that the stamp taxes should not be reintroduced because they were disiortionary and difficult to administer. If some room .' can be generated for tax reductions, the cuts should first be directed at the more distortionary taxes such as the stamp tax on financial Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - transactions, which contributes to the large spread between commercial bank borrowing and lending rates. A tax policy mission from FAD is to advise on these issues around mid-year. The staff urged the authorities to accelerate the pace of privatization or to break up the monopoly position granted to state enterprises in key sectors, as a way of improving e-fficiency and increasing investment. The authorities agreed with this view, pointing out that important technical work had been done during the past year to prepare.for the privatization of the remaining designated enterprises and such major enterprises as CORPOSANA (water) and ANTELCO (the telephone company). The mission also urged them to implement a reform of the social security and health systems, with the aim of eventually creating a system of private capitalized pension funds, but the authorities noted that there was as yet no political consensus on these reforms. 3. Monetarv, policv and financial sector reform The authorities' monetary program for 1995 foresees the demand for broad money growing by about 6 percentage points higher than nominal GDP, in line with the average experience of the past several years, L/ and a modest accumulation of international reserves. The authorities plan to use limited open market operations to keep the growth of monetary aggregates roughly in line with the projected demand. Given the need to restrain inflation and the expected overall balance of payments surplus, the mission cautioned against further reductions in reserve requirements at this time, and recommended that the central bank reserve requirement certificates be rolled over next October, and remunerated. The mission also urged the authorities to move forcefully in enforcing strict capitalization and provisioning requirements on the financial sector, and to strengthen the banking superintendency, which lacks trained staff. Pressure to comply with regulations could induce welcome mergers. The authorities also should seek to restrict credits to related enterprises or individuals, and expedite the setting up of a central risk bureau. The mission observed that passage of the general Banking Law was also crucial, without any watering down of the ability of the BCP to impose and enforce prudential regulations. The mission suggested that the authorities establish a rating system for financial institutions based on their capitalization, assets, management, earnings and liquidity, and allow the IPS from henceforward to place new deposits only in the highest rated institutions. In the meantime, the IPS could be required to place new deposits in proportion to the capital of the banks, with a view to reducing its exposure to risk. The mission 1/ The remonetization of recent years may reflect a reduction in the scope of informal financial markets, which had expanded strongly during the 1980s. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - also suggested that the IPS be allowed to invest a portion of its surpluses abroad. In late May, after the mission's departure, the BCP intervened two large local banks (representing some 11 percent of the total assets of the system) and forced three others to increase capitalization immediately. Management was replaced in the intervened banks, and the BCP provided over 9 200 billion (15 percent of the monetary base) in financial assistance to face deposit withdrawals. The deposits appear to have shifted mainly to other local intermediaries, as there was no significant pressure on international reserves or on the exchange rate following the intervention. The authorities are considering placing central bank notes or increasing the legal reserve requirement to mop up tt:e liquidity injected as a result of this operation. 4. External sector policies Under the managed float exchange rate policy, over the past few years, Paraguay has tended to improve its international competitiveness, as measured by the real effective exchange rate (REER). The staff commented that this policy may have contributed to'maintaining high inflationary expectations in spite of relatively moderate demand pressures. The author- ities placed great importance on safeguarding international competitiveness, particularly of Paraguay's agricultural exports (cotton and soybeans), and noted that the real appreciation of the currencies of its major trading partners in MERCOSLJR may (distort the interpretation of the REER data. Nevertheless, the staff noted that small real appreciation of the guarani over the next 12-18 month,s could make a contribution to lowering inflation to international levels, provided it was combined with consistent fiscal and monetary policies, and wage restraint. In the trade and payments area, the authorities noted that, under MERCOSUR Paraguay -has eliminated all quantitative restrictions on imports or exports. The staff encouraged the authorities to avoid protective measures in retaliation to actions by other partners. 5. Medium-term projectio= The staff prepared a medium-term <economic policy scenario (Table 5), that aims at a lowering of inflation to industrial country levels in two to three years, and an acceleration of growth under the assumption of continued prudent financial policies, stepped up public investment, and structural reforms. The latter would include strengthening the financial sector (passage of banking legislation, impro.red bank supervision, and compliance with capital and provisioning rules), improved tax administration, privatization of the enterprises approTred for privatization under the 1991 law and others. These policies would be reflected in increased investment and art acceleration of exports. Public investment would increase faster than private investment reflecting expenditures in needed infrastructure and in the health and education sectors. Xt was noted that private savings and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - investment could be increased even more rapidly through reforms to the social security system (including setting up capitalized private pension funds), and by privatizing the important state enterprises, such as CORPCJSANA, ANTELCO and the cement plant. Stepped up investment financed by direct capital inflows and increased public sector foreign borrowing would be reflected in a widening of the external current account deficit to around 5 percent of GDP over the next three years. Outstanding public debt would rise only moderately to around 16 percent of GDP by the turn of the century, and interest payments would rise from 6 l/2 to 8 l/2 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services over the period, which can be considered prudent levels. In the fiscal area, the medium term projections foresee an increase in tax burden as a result of improvements in the administration of taxes and the IPS. On the expenditure side, if the growth of the wage bill can be kept in line with the projected rate of inflation, room could be generated for increases in other current outlays associated with higher investment in education and health, as well as for tax reductions. Public investment is projected to increase to around 6 percent of GDP on the basis of a greater use of the large pipeline of undisbursed foreign loans, mainly from IDB and IBRD (net inflows of around 1 l/2 percent of GDP a year) and an enhanced capacity to execute projects. I/ The public sector would continue to accumulate domestic surpluses, corresponding mainly to the surpluses of the IPS, which should facilitate the growth of private investment. 6. Statistical issues The staff discussed with the authorities the deficiencies in the statistical information as well as the need for technical assistance in this area (see Appendix III). Officials expressed interest in Fund support to strengthen economic data collection and analysis. The timing and scope of Fund technical assistance in the statistical area is currently under discussion. IV. Staff Appraisal Since 1989 the Paraguayan authorities have embarked on a process of modernization, structural adjustment and integration into world markets. To advance this process the present administration, which assumed office in August 1993, has initiated the privatization process for several public enterprises, improved tax administration, widened the tax base, and promoted financial sector reform. As a result of these efforts, Paraguay re- established its international creditworthiness; the fiscal accounts were brought under control; the balance of payments was strengthened; external I/ For simplicity, no adjustment to the breakdown between public and private investment was made to reflect privatization. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - debt was reduced; and official reserves rose significantly. Per capita income, however, has stagnated and inflation, although below the peak of about 40 percent recorded in 1990, has remained high at around 20 percent a year since 1992. Policies should therefore concentrate on reducing inflation and accelerating GDP growth through structural reform. A reduction in inElation to international levels will require a change in indexation practices, backed by tight fiscal and monetary policies. Future adjustments in the minimum wage and public sector wages should be made according to programmed inflation. Public sector tariff adjustments could follow a similar rule while ensuring that the financial viability of the enterprises is not compromised. Nonbudgeted public sector wage adjust- ments should not be given in 1995, because of the adverse effect on expectations. The Central Government and the public enterprises should continue to avoid use of domestic financing and the surpluses of the IPS should continue to be channeled to finance private sector investment, with some portion invested abroad. A much-needed increase in public investment could be financed in part through a prudent use of foreign borrowing. Efforts should be made to reduce the public sector work force and current expenditure should be reoriented to reducing employment and outlays in nonproductive areas, and to raising and improving the quality of expenditures on health and education, which are still very low by regional standards. Although the tax to GDP ratio has increased over the past few years, tax collections in Paraguay are still among the lowest in Latin America. Low direct taxes give Paraguay an important advantage within MERCOSUR,.and should be preserved. There is still much room to reduce evasion, and the staff supports the authorities efforts to improve tax and social security administration and broaden the tax base by extending the VAT to the agricultural sector and introducing the tax on imputed income in the agricultural sector. A gradual reduction in the rate of the corporate income tax should take place only after the elimination of distortionary taxes such as the stamp tax on financial transactions, and shou.ld be accompanied by new measures to prevent any weakening of public sector savings. The inefficiency of ttle state enterprises and the low level of invest- ment in the areas that they monopolize is a major obstacle to growth. The staff would therefore urge the authorities to move rapidly to privatize not only the remaining enterprises included in the 1991 privatization law, but also key enterprises such as the telephone company, the water and sewage compan:y, the cement plant, and others. Privatization, or permitting the private sector to deliver such services, could be expected to be followed by a rapid increase in private investment in these sectors. The revenue from privatization could be used to supplement the resources of the Industrial Development Fund. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - A reform of the health and pension system is necessary and should be pursued. Administrative capacities of the IPS need to be reinforced, coverage of the system should be improved and a system of capitalized pension funds implemented. The IPS should also be transformed into a capitalized system, competing with other pension funds. The recent intervention of two Paraguayan banks is evidence of serious problems in the financial sector. An excessively large number of small and often undercapitalized institutions have been permitted to operate in Paraguay, and there also is a large informal financial sector. The legisla- tion aimed at improving the legal framework for the banking system should be passed rapidly, and the authorities are urged to insist that financial institutions be brought into full compliance with capital and provisioning requirements within six months to a year and their lending to related companies should be sharply curtailed. Major efforts should continue to strengthen banking supervision, enforce standard.accounting procedures and improve transparency. Mergers should be promoted to achieve economies of scale. In view of Paraguay's relatively strong international competitive position and that the overall balance of payments is strong, exchange rate policy could make a contribution to break domestic inflation over the next 12-18 months in coordination with wage and financial policies--for example, by making adjustments to the nominal rate that were slightly below targeted inflation, less projected international inflation. Basic economic and financial data in Paraguay are seriously deficient and the staff would urge the authorities to take steps, along the lines suggested in Appendix III, to improve their quality, timeliness and coverage, particularly regarding the external sector and the monetary survey. In this regard possible Fund assistance to Paraguay is presently being discussed with the authorities. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultations with Paraguay be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Institutional capacity building, through components in individual operations, as well as stand-alone Institutional Development Fund grants, will be an important aspect of World Bank assistance. The lending program is small, with about two operations per year totaling about US$210 million over the FY 1996-98 period. Loans for secondary education, natural resource management and health are in advanced stages of preparation. If warranted, this program could be increased in response to Paraguay's needs, implementation capacity, and availability of other external financing. A relatively large program of economic and sector work was carried out in the recent past to rebuild the World Bank's knowledge base of the country and identify operations fo:Llowing an eight year hiatus in Bank lending. For the FY 1996-98 period, at least one formal and one informal task is planned, to support new lending (transport, urban development, financial sector, education) and monitor the macroeconomic framework. Six World Bank-financed project presently are under execution in Paraguay with USS249.5 million undisbursed as of March 31, 1995. These projects include: Land Use Rationalization, Rural Water Supply, Highways, Natural Resource Management, Private Sector Development, and Asuncibn Sewerage. World Bank net disbursements to Paraguay have been negative since 1987 reflecting the absence of new loan commitments from 1984 to 1992.

Putstanding statistical issues The compilation of Paraguay's macroeconomic statistics is complicated by the high proportion of unrecorded and entrepot trade and the large informal financial sector. As a result, the national accounts, balance of payments, and financial statistics are characterized by significant margins of error. There are also deficiencies in the coverage of the public finance and the labor market data. a. Real sector The currentness and coverage of real sector statistics need improve- ment. The Central Bank is in the process of improving the quality of its national accounts with technical assistance from the United Nations. Statistics on agricultural production need to be reconciled between the Central Bank and Ministry of Agriculture. Employment and earnings statistics only cover the metropolitan Asuncion area and are not reported to the Fund's Statistics Department. The weights employed in the calculation of the wholesale price index are based upon 1969 data and exclude major agricultural products such as soybeans. A new household expenditure survey has been completed and will be used to update-the base and coverage of the consumer price index. b. Public finances Coverage of fiscal diata needs to be extended to the municipalities and incorporated public enterprises. Greater coordination is needed among the Ministry of Finance, the Technical Planning Secretariat, and the public enterprises to produce a consistent set of data on the operations of the general government (with a complete coverage of decentralized agencies) and enterprises, particularly with respect to capital spending. Public enter- prise reporting should be on an accrual as well as cash flow basis, and the reporting lag (up to two months) needs to be reduced. Domestic financing operations need to be reconciled with financial sector data. C. Financial sectoL Central Bank monitoring of financial sector developments is limited to the banking system. The accounts of the major nonbank institutions are collected, but they need to be combined with those of the banking system to produce a more complete financial survey. There is a large network of informal financial institutions outside the regular reporting system. Banking system data on public sector operations are inconsistent with fiscal data, although progress towards better consistency was made since early 1995, and certain public sector entities are misclassified as financial institutions. Reporting lags by financial institutions (up to eight weeks long) need to be reduced. A more accurate and complete system of reporting of interest rates is needed.

The external sector Trade statistics are unreliable because of the large volume of unrecorded and entrepet trade, including unrecorded entrepot trade. There are large differences between customs (recorded) data on exports and imports and direction of trade (DOT) data reported to the Statistics Department by Paraguay's trading partner countries. DOT data capture some of the unrecorded trade, but are subject to frequent and sometimes substantial revisions because of reporting lags by trading partner countries. Data on private capital inflows are also not firm, and there are large errors and omissions in the balance of payments. Coordination is needed among the Central Bank, Ministry of Finance, and public enterprises to produce a consistent set of public sector external debt statistics. There are no data on private sector external debt.
