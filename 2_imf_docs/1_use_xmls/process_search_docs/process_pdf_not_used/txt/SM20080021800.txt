Panama was one of the fastest growing economies in the world in 2007 with real growth accelerating to 11.2 percent, following an average growth rate of nearly 8 percent in 2004–06. At the same time, employment expanded significantly, leading to a decline in unemployment to an unprecedented level, and public finance have strengthened significantly. However, inflation increased, mainly because of the global increase in food and fuel prices, and the current account deficit widened reflecting both higher consumption and investment, the latter in part due to a surge in FDI.

Economic Growth and Regional Trade2.      Economic activity in Panama remains robust. Activity remains strong in the services sector, including the canal, ports, and the Colon Free Zone (CFZ), which benefited from the rebound in global and regional trade in the past few years. Construction activity continues to soar (growing 90 percent (y/y) at end-March 2008) as a result of strong domestic and external demand for housing and infrastructure investment. In addition, the well-developed financial center (the largest in Central America) continues to grow robustly after quickly responding to regional growth and stability and attracting significant new investment. Finally, consumer and investor confidence is high resulting in buoyant consumption and investment.                                                   1 The team that visited Panama City during May 5–16 comprised of Mmes. Gold (head) and Kaltani, and Messrs. Keller and Mehrez (all WHD). The team met with the Minister of Economy and Finance, Mr. Alexander, the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Salazar, the Deputy Head of the Comptroller General’s Office, Mr. Amado, and the Superintendent of Banks, Mr. Barrelier. Mr. Macia (Advisor to the ED) participated in all the meetings.

A slowdown in the United States would affect Panama directly by reducing demand for exports and tourism—the U.S. is Panama’s main trading partner, representing 30 percent of goods exports and imports—and indirectly, through its effects on the region. Panama’s business cycle has been highly correlated with that of the Latin America region (correlation of 0.67 during 1992–2007) and a slowdown in the region would impact demand for services from the CFZ, ports, and the financial sector.  02468101219921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008U.SCosta RicaPanamaLatin America (excl. the Caribbean and Dominican Republic)Real GDP growthSource: World Economic Outlook; and Fund staff estimates.Figure 2.  Economic Growth in the Region4.      Furthermore, capacity constraints may be emerging. The open unemployment rate fell to an unprecedented 4.6 percent in March 2008, and there is some anecdotal evidence of labor shortages in specific sectors (e.g., architects and engineers in the construction sector). This would be consistent with estimates of the output gap, which suggest that GDP exceeded its potential by 1–4 percentage points in 2007 (Box 1).2                                                    Table 2.
