The team comprised Messrs. Teo (Head), Hori, Straub, and Zulverdi (all APD). In addition, Messrs. Ganguly (AsDB), Matin, Schoenberger, and Ms. Sherburne-Benz (all World Bank) also participated.  • Counterparts: Prime Minister General Soe Win, Minister of Finance and Revenue Major-General Hla Tun, Governor Kyaw Kyaw Maung of the Central Bank of Myanmar, Minister of National Planning and Economic Development U Soe Tha, Minister of Agriculture Major-General Htay Oo, other senior government officials, and representatives of the private sector, diplomatic missions, and international organizations. • Context of surveillance: There has been little progress on the seven-step “Road Map to Democracy,” which was unveiled in 2003. A number of countries continue to maintain a range of sanctions and restrictions on trade and investment. In recent years, the authorities and the Fund have generally agreed on policy priorities in a number of areas. However, in many of these areas the authorities have either favored more gradual and measured steps reflecting their concerns about the risks that strong action might entail, or have cited the lack of international support and technical capacity as reasons for not taking recommended steps. Nevertheless, there has been some progress in the areas of fiscal consolidation, exchange rate unification, and agricultural reform which were highlighted as key reforms by Directors in the 2004 Article IV consultation.  • This was a streamlined consultation. • Exchange rate system: Myanmar continues to avail itself of transitional arrangements under Article XIV, although it has eliminated all Article XIV restrictions. Myanmar maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. These include (i) limits on the availability of foreign exchange for foreign travel by residents, (ii) limits on remittances of wage income by nonresidents, and (iii) limits on payments and transfers for certain other invisible transactions, and a multiple currency practice resulting from the divergence between the official exchange rate and the parallel market-determined FEC rate. • Data: Quality, coverage, and timeliness remain weak, hampering surveillance.

Growth has picked up and the balance of payments has benefited from gas exports. However, living standards are low and inflation is increasing.  • The medium-term economic outlook is unfavorable especially when compared to the country’s potential. While near-term growth prospects have improved, prospects for sustained growth in real income are constrained by inflation, structural rigidities, weak economic policies, and low investment. • The reforms needed in Myanmar are extensive, and constraints are formidable. Discussions focused on selected policy issues that are crucial for restoring macroeconomic stability and invigorating growth. These are to: (i) reduce the fiscal deficit, (ii) unify exchange rate, (iii) reform the banking sector, and (iv) further liberalize the agricultural sector.  • The authorities are in general agreement with these policy priorities although there was little discussion of concrete measures for reform. Decision-making is centralized and staff did not meet with the highest levels of government. • Several measures consistent with past Fund advice have been taken. These are to improve revenue collection and the financial performance of state economic enterprises (SEEs), and to relax controls on agriculture.  • However, there has been no or limited progress in formally reforming the exchange rate system and improving banking supervision and regulation. Further, the recent increase in wages and capital expenditure will lead to budget deficits that are inflationary. • The authorities cite the need for gradual changes, especially given the lack of international support, as well as capacity constraints to explain the lack of progress. • The authorities requested further Fund and Bank advice in key reform areas. For the Fund these include: exchange rate unification, banking sector reforms, AML/CFT, and statistics.  • Given its selective focus, the team did not cover the following areas in depth: (i) trade restrictions; (ii) Myanmar’s relations with international creditors; (iii) debt sustainability; (iv) the effectiveness of Myanmar’s AML/CFT laws.

Myanmar, despite its rich resources and vast potential, suffers from decades of weak economic policies and poor economic performance. Per capita GDP is now significantly below those of other low-income countries in the region. Poverty appears widespread and social development indicators lag those in the region (Figure 1). 2.      Myanmar faces macroeconomic instability and pervasive structural weaknesses:  • Fiscal deficits in excess of 5 percent of GDP have been routinely financed through money creation, resulting in periodic high inflation and currency depreciation. • Revenues are low reflecting limited tax coverage, weak tax administration, and widespread discretionary tax exemptions.  • SEEs do not operate on a commercial basis and are a drain on the government budget. • A multiple exchange rate regime discourages normal international transactions and distorts economic activities. • While the banking crisis of 2003 has receded, the banking sector is still weak and cannot adequately support private sector activities. • Agriculture, which accounts for about 40 percent of GDP, is constrained by administrative controls that reduce farmers’ production incentives. 3.      Economic data are inconsistent, late, and unreliable, making it difficult to assess economic developments. The central bank reports a number of core statistics to the Fund on a monthly basis and provides more comprehensive data to Article IV consultation missions. However, data shortcomings and long time lags continue to hamper surveillance. Major reasons for these problems include capacity constraints, including the lack of technical skills (exacerbated by low external assistance), as well as the more general nontransparent governing environment.1 II.   RECENT DEVELOPMENTS—GROWTH DESPITE CHALLENGES 4.      Recent economic developments have been mixed.  Economic growth has picked up • There has been a pickup in growth on the back of stronger export growth, especially in natural gas, agricultural expansion, booming construction, and some normalization of the banking sector.                                                  1 See Annex I.

The fiscal deficit has declined but remains high • The deficit declined to below 4 percent of GDP in 2005/06 with revenue collection relative to GDP reaching 6 percent, from around 5 percent in previous years (Figure 2).  • This is mainly due to several recent tax measures that are consistent with the Fund’s past advice. These include steps to improve tax administration, reduce tax evasion, raise the exchange rate used to value imports for tariff purposes,3 and, more recently, contributions from SEEs. Increasing earnings from gas exports have little impact on the budget as they are converted at the official exchange rate.                                                     2 Similar to other economies with central planning features, the growth targeting system introduced in 1999/2000 has likely generated incentives for officials at various levels to over-report growth rates. Staff and authorities estimates of growth have diverged since that period. See Tables 5 and 6 for staff estimates of growth. In this report, official GDP, which is available up to 2005/06, is used in calculating all ratios. 3 For example, the authorities increased the custom valuation rate from K 100 per U.S. dollar to K 450 per U.S. dollar in mid-2004. More recently, the rate on border trade was increased to K 850 per U.S. dollar.

The deficit continued to be financed entirely by the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM).  Box 1. A Salary Hike for Government Employees In late March 2006, the authorities announced a 5–12 time increase in the salaries of government employees, that is, union government, SEE employees, and military personnel, effective April 1. At the lowest salary scale, this was an increase from K 3,000 (about US$2.2 dollars at the market exchange rate) per month to K 15,000. At the highest scale, salaries rose to about K 200,000 from K 16,000 per month. At the same time, wages for day laborers were increased to K 500 from K 100.  The increase was long overdue as salaries had failed to keep up with inflation. The last major adjustment occurred in FY2000/01 but since then the CPI has increased by more than 200 percent. Low wages forced government employees to hold additional jobs and created incentives for corruption.  The salary hike will result in a larger wage bill although the effect is smaller than the headline increase of 5–12 times. This is because (i) the bulk of employees received hikes at the lower end of the scale and (ii) the increase only applied to basic salaries and not fixed allowances which have not been changed. Consequently, expenditure on salaries is expected to only triple from K 170 to K 540 million (an expansion of about 2 percent of GDP) in 2006/07.  The overall impact on the budget deficit for 2006/07 is expected to be smaller as the wage increase will be offset by higher contributions from SEEs which were allowed to increase prices to levels closer to the market.                                                    4 A reason for this is expenditure associated with the move to the new capital. The government began moving from Yangon to Nay Pyi Taw, located about 320 kilometers north of Yangon, on November 6, 2005. About     1–2 percent of GDP has been spent in the last few years by the government on the move. This level of spending is expected to continue in 2006/07 before declining.

Inflation has been volatile reflecting changes in monetary growth and food prices. After falling sharply in 2003/04, monetary aggregates expanded rapidly because of deficit financing and the receding effects of the banking crisis. In addition, the authorities increased fuel prices by more than 800 percent in October 2005, triggering general price increases. The public sector salary hike has also led to expectations of higher inflation. The authorities increased administratively set interest rates5 in an attempt to mitigate the inflationary consequences of the wage increase. -50050100150200Jan-01Jan-02Jan-03Jan-04Jan-05Jan-06Rice PricesCPICPI without rice pricesA ban of rice exports (Jan. 2004)Inflation and Rice Price Change (Year-on-year percent change)Sources: Myanmar authorities; and Fund staff calculations.-50050100150200Jan-01Jan-02Jan-03Jan-04Jan-05Jan-06Broad Money InflationFEC (kyat/US$) RateInflation, FEC Depreciation and Money Growth(Year-on-year percent change)Banking crisis begins (Early 2003) The market exchange rate has depreciated • Not surprisingly, the market-determined exchange rate6 has continued to depreciate. With a premium of about 20,000 percent, the official rate is clearly over-valued and its use in transactions is limited.                                                   5 Interest rates on a wide range of instruments—the CBM’s rediscount facility, T-bills, and T-bonds—were increased by 2–2.75 percent in April. 6 The official exchange rate is pegged to the SDR at K 8.5 per SDR (K 5.7 per U.S. dollar as of September 12, 2006). Formally, this rate only applies to transactions undertaken by the central government and SEEs. In practice, the government and SEEs continue to use the official rate for accounting purposes but its use in transactions is rationed.

Although the current account surplus has grown recently, it is difficult to judge the appropriateness of the exchange rate given restrictions on current and capital account transactions.  02004006008001000120014001600Jan-00Jan-01Jan-02Jan-03Jan-04Jan-05Jan-060246810121416FEC Market Rate (left scale)Official Rate (right scale)Exchange Rate (Kyat per U.S. Dollar)Sources: Myanmar authorities; and Fund staff calculations.020406080100120140Jan-00Jan-01Jan-02Jan-03Jan-04Jan-05Jan-06Real Exchange RateNominal Exchange RateReal and Nominal FEC Exchange Rate(US$/kyat, January 2000=100) The balance of payments has improved • The current account surplus has increased rapidly reflecting the surge in gas exports7 and difficulties in importing goods. Gas exports, which comprise 50 percent of total exports, have followed increases in world gas price which has doubled over the last year (Figure 3).  • The surplus was sufficient to more than offset a deterioration in the financial account because of lower foreign direct investment. As a result, gross official reserves increased                                                                                                                                                        (e.g., trade, tourism, foreign investment); this exchange rate is market-determined and currently stands at about K 1,345 per U.S. dollar. There is also an “illegal,” but tolerated parallel market that exchanges dollars with kyats at a small premium over the FEC market-determined rate. This informal market-determined rate is widely used in transactions. In 2001–02, about 30–40 percent of transactions were estimated to be carried out at the official rate; this estimate has not been updated but the market rate is now more widely used. The central bank monitors rates in the informal and FEC markets.  7 In recent years, natural gas has become Myanmar’s largest single source of export revenue. Following the commencement of production at two major foreign-funded offshore gas projects—the Yetagun and Yadana projects with total estimated reserves of 10 trillion cu.ft. (0.16 percent of world total)—annual natural gas output has reached 370 billion cu.ft. per year. Recent gas discoveries could further increase gas production and exports over the medium term: a South Korean and Indian consortium developing the Shwe offshore gas field confirmed last year that the site held reserves of around 2.9–3.6 trillion cu.ft. (roughly 0.07 percent of total world proven reserves). The consortium plans to sell the gas to China or India.

The banking sector remains weak • Despite progress, the banking system has not fully recovered from the 2003 crisis, both in terms of the level of intermediation as well as performance and soundness (Box 2). Box 2. Is the Banking Crisis Over? Bank intermediation is still below the pre-crisis levels. There is also no significant long-term lending and some restrictions on banking activities introduced during the crisis remain in place. Low public confidence and rising inflation have led the public to prefer cash, foreign currencies, or short-term deposits.   Banks’ soundness have improved, particularly among private banks, but signs of weaknesses remain, notably among state banks.  State banks face high NPLs1 (although levels have declined somewhat in the last couple of years), inadequate capital, and low profitability. Further, an accurate assessment of state banks’ soundness is obscured by accounting problems.  Private banks have recorded significant improvements in asset quality and have high levels of liquidity and CAR. However, restrictions imposed during the 2003/04 crisis have made it difficult for them to carry out banking activities.

The medium-term economic outlook is unfavorable especially when compared to the country’s potential. While near-term growth prospects have improved, prospects for sustained growth in real income are constrained by inflation, structural rigidities, weak economic policies, and low investment. In staff’s view, under current policies:  • Growth rate will slow down to less than 5 percent, as structural rigidities and poor policies continue to discourage investment and production, outside of gas and hydroelectricity. • The fiscal deficit of around 4–5 percent of GDP will continue to fuel inflation. With the deficit financed through money creation, inflation is projected to climb from 13 percent this year to 30–40 percent in the medium term. The market-determined exchange rate—which reflects confidence in the currency—is expected to further depreciate. 01020304050607000/0101/0202/0303/0404/0505/0606/0707/0808/0909/10CPI InflationBroad Money GrowthMoney Growth and Inflation(Year-on-year percent change)0246810121400/0101/0202/0303/0404/0505/0606/0707/0808/0909/1008162432404856Public Sector Deficit (left scale)Broad Money Growth (right scale)Source: Fund staff projections.Higher Deficits Leading to Faster Money Growth • The current account would return to balance as gas price increases moderate and slowly decline, while production stabilizes. Myanmar remains in debt distress.9 • The economy would remain vulnerable to adverse shocks. A harvest failure, political turmoil, or a new banking crisis, could cause severe economic disruption. A decline in gas prices or lower than expected production will also adversely affect the economy. 6.      The authorities are more optimistic on medium-term growth prospects. The 2006–10 five-year plan calls for growth of about 10 percent on average. The authorities                                                  8 Projections are based on staff estimates of GDP growth rather than official GDP.  9 See Annex II.

IV.   ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICY CHALLENGES A.   Reducing Inflation 7.      The key to reducing inflation lies in controlling the fiscal deficit and, over the medium term, controlling monetary aggregates. Staff recommended:  • On the revenue side, further reducing discretionary exemptions and increasing the exchange rate for import valuation closer toward the market rate.  • On the expenditure side, better rationalizing capital expenditure with systematic cost-benefit analyses.  • Reforms of SEEs are another key measure to reduce the burden on the budget; this would include better management incentives and pricing policy.  • Over the longer term, deregulating interest rates and providing the CBM greater independence to control money supply are necessary to safeguard price stability. Once this occurs, budget deficits should be financed through public debt issuance rather than money creation. 8.      The authorities recognize the importance of keeping the deficit low in order to maintain price stability. They noted a commitment to containing the deficit below 4 percent and believe this can be done through improvements in tax administration and collection. However, there is also a need for continued investment in infrastructure. As external financing or assistance is limited, higher-than-desirable deficits may be necessary. The authorities also agreed with staff on the desirability for more independent monetary policy but noted that this will take time and technical assistance. On inflation, the authorities noted administrative measures—such as “moral suasion” on traders—taken to moderate price increases. B.   Exchange Rate Unification 9.      The current dual exchange rate system is not working. There is an active informal foreign exchange market and many transactions take place at—or are indexed to—the market exchange rate. At the same time, the use of the official rate is severely rationed and the authorities have allowed the system to evolve toward gradual exchange rate unification, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 15 which was the substance of the Fund’s advice (Box 3). However, by not formally recognizing the change, the current system is not transparent, imposes high costs on participants, creates incentives for corruption, and cannot fully develop into a well-functioning foreign exchange market. When the official exchange rate is used, it distorts economic activity, and reduces public finances and available foreign exchange. It also complicates economic analysis, for example, by making it difficult to estimate GDP or evaluate SEE efficiency. Staff therefore recommended:  • Unifying the exchange rate at the market-determined rate, which would be allowed to float.  • Once unification occurs, the next step would be to gradually liberalize the current and eventually capital accounts. Current import and export licensing requirements, for instance, create significant distortions and rents. Obviously, liberalization should be sequenced and designed to maintain external and financial stability.   Box 3. Exchange Rate Unification  While in earlier consultations, staff argued in favor of immediate unification, in the recent years the focus of the discussion has been on implementing stepwise unification of the multiple exchange rate regime. The latter would meet authorities’ preference for gradual liberalization. It would also address risks that are a concern to the authorities: a possible reduction in foreign exchange availability, a deterioration of public finances, a rise in inflation, and political risks associated with a dramatic exchange rate reform. Options discussed include: (i) reducing over time SEEs’ access to foreign exchange at the official rate; (ii) gradually removing selected exporting and importing SEEs from the obligation to transact at the official rate; and (iii) abolishing the official rate, but introducing an explicit system of subsidies (to compensate importing SEEs) and taxes (to capture the gains to exporting SEEs), which would then be phased out over time.  Developments in the export sector and the corresponding increase in foreign exchange reserves provide a good opportunity for exchange rate unification. Further, staff expects the adverse macroeconomic impact of exchange rate unification to be limited, as the economy is already mostly operating at the market rate.     10.      The authorities agreed with staff’s views on the economic merits of unification but remain concerned over possible risks. In particular, they believe a strong international reserve position as well as external financing support are necessary conditions for unification. This would minimize possible balance of payments concerns and political risks associated with unification. Nevertheless, the authorities welcomed further discussion and advice from staff on the benefits and potential risks of unification, as well as on an implementation strategy.

Banking sector reforms—necessary to support growth and maintain stability—need to address weaknesses in state banks, gaps in prudential regulation and supervision, and low public confidence. The CBM has taken many steps to deal with weaknesses in the system, including those related to AML/CFT. At the same time, tight, ad hoc, and nontransparent administrative controls imposed by the CBM constrain the development of the banking sector. The challenge is to normalize banking activities so intermediation can develop, but to do so in a prudent manner. Staff recommended a comprehensive reform strategy that includes: • Addressing weaknesses in state banks by ensuring they have sufficient capital are run on a commercial basis, and have resolved NPL problems. • Introducing a prudential framework and supervisory practices that are consistent with international best practices so the system can develop safely. One aspect would be upgrading regulations and enforcing them fairly and in a transparent manner.  12.      The authorities agreed with staff recommendations but explained that progress has been slow given the lack of technical capacity. The priority since the 2003/04 crisis has been to maintain stability even if this restricted the sector’s development. However, as the situation improves, administrative measures are being relaxed. The authorities would like to implement best practices, but need assistance in order to do so. D.   Further Liberalizing Agriculture 13.      To improve rural household living standards and foster growth, staff recommended: • Further liberalizing agriculture, including more relaxation of export bans on rice and other commodities. The current focus on export restrictions to address authorities’ concerns over price stability and availability (especially for rice), places the burden of policies on farmers and results in lower investment and production. Other approaches, such as those applied in neighboring countries, can meet the authorities’ policy goals through market mechanisms. There is also the need to ensure consistent application of the reforms, particularly at the local administrative levels where some officials may apply ad hoc production or marketing controls to achieve perceived production or price targets.  • Improving the availability of credit in the rural areas by developing multiple financial service providers and current microfinance programs. 14.      The authorities noted progress in privatization, dismantling production controls, and the partial relaxation of the rice export ban as steps that have been taken to liberalize the sector. Further liberalization is envisioned, in line with improvements that would safeguard food security and price stability.

Other Issues 15.      Staff also discussed two important complementary policies: • The investment climate has deteriorated and private investment, outside of gas and hydroelectricity, continues to decline. Policies to address this could include: (i) having more transparent and predictable rules and regulations; (ii) rationalizing widespread administrative controls and licensing requirements for imports and exports; (iii) improving transportation, energy, and telecommunication infrastructures; and (iv) upgrading human capital.  • There is a need to improve data quality and timeliness. There are continuing concerns over the reliability of recorded data, especially on growth rates. Some data are also available only after very long lags. Steps to improve data collection—adoption of best practices and adequate resources to statistical agencies—would increase the quality and timeliness of data, and their credibility. V.   STAFF APPRAISAL 16.      Myanmar is taking steps to transition from a centrally-planned to a market-based economy. Nevertheless, despite rich resources and vast potential, the economy suffers from continued high inflation, structural impediments that discourage investment, and low living standards. 17.      Staff welcomes progress in improving revenue collection although further steps are still necessary to reduce the budget deficit in order to control inflation. These include SEE reforms and better control over capital expenditure. A more balanced budget would eventually provide room for an increase in social spending, especially on health and education, which has declined in relative terms. Over the longer term, deregulating interest rates and providing the CBM greater independence to control money supply are necessary to safeguard stability.  18.      The official exchange rate is clearly over-valued but it is difficult to judge the appropriateness of the market exchange rate given restrictions on international transactions. 19.      Moving more quickly toward a unified exchange rate will bring significant benefits. While the market rate is widely used, the current system is not transparent, imposes Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 18 high costs on participants, creates incentives for corruption, distorts economic activity, and reduces public finances and available foreign exchange.  20.      Staff do not recommend approval of the exchange restrictions and multiple currency practice identified on page 1 as there is no timetable for their removal. Myanmar maintains restrictions on transactions by certain terrorists and terrorist organizations in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001). 21.      Banking sector reforms must address remaining systemic weaknesses, gaps in prudential regulation and supervision, and low public confidence. Moving towards a prudential and regulatory framework that is consistent with international best practices can safeguard banking sector health and support its development.  22.      Liberalization of agriculture should be deepened, including elimination of export bans on rice and other commodities. Alternative, market-based, approaches which can support both production incentives and price stabilization should be considered. 23.      Greater efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of data would better inform policy-making. Data shortcomings and timeliness continue to hamper surveillance. 24.      The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Myanmar be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

MYANMAR: STATISTICAL ISSUES  1. Myanmar compiles a range of economic and social statistics and the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) reports a number of core statistics to the Fund on a monthly basis and provides more comprehensive data for the Article IV consultation missions.10 However, data shortcomings continue to hinder the monitoring of economic developments and the assessment of policy proposals. In addition, dissemination has been limited. Reporting of real sector data for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) has recently improved, but the timeliness of the data series remains an issue.  National accounts 2. National accounts statistics are available only on an annual basis and revisions are typically not issued before a new year starts. Private sector activity may be underestimated as no effort is made to achieve complete coverage of economic activity, including informal sector activities. Thus, estimates of GDP may not fully account for informal sector activity. The use of the highly overvalued official exchange rate for conversion purposes results in understatement of external trade and the foreign exchange content of consumption, government expenditures, and investment.   Price indices 3. The CPI is based on weights derived from the 1997 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (the previous base year was 1986). The CPI comprises 135 consumption items. Its regional coverage is expanded, and the consumption items include wider coverage of items at market prices (rather than at controlled prices) as well as a larger share of imported goods. However, the index remains urban: a price index for rural areas has not yet been compiled. The only administered prices are education fees and electricity, which together amount to 4 percent of the CPI basket.                                                   10 The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) publishes the Statistical Yearbook, which includes a wide range of economic, social, and demographic time series; the latest issue was for 2001, and is also available in CD ROM format. The CSO also publishes the Selected Monthly Economic Indicators, which include monthly data on consumer prices, selected producer prices and output volumes, tourism, transportation, and foreign trade and investment; the latest issue was for October 2005.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 27 Government finance  4. There is no comprehensive monthly and quarterly compilation of fiscal data. Although a flash report is produced by the CBM on a monthly basis, and the Budget Department prepares every four months a summary report based on provisional information on cash expenditures collected from the ministries; the coverage of these reports is incomplete. Annual comprehensive data are compiled with delays of up to 12 months after the end of the reference year. In addition, only consolidated data for state economic enterprises (SEEs) are available, and some transactions are recorded partly on an accrual basis and partly on a cash basis. Fiscal and monetary data are not consistent. Budget estimates and actuals tend to differ by wide margins in part because of supplementary budget approvals for spending increases halfway through the fiscal year.   5. Annual data on the operations of the consolidated central government are reported to the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. The reported data, however, do not include an economic classification of expenditure. In addition, improving debt recording would enhance fiscal transparency.  Monetary accounts 6. The CBM compiles and reports a monetary survey with a lag of three to four months.  This time lag reflects the lack of technological infrastructure for timely collection and processing of data from a geographically widespread bank branch network, and the delay in compiling government accounts at the Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB), which manages them (rather than the Ministry of Finance and Revenue).  7. The monetary survey compiled by the CBM covers the central bank and all commercial banks, state-owned and private. The quality of monetary data reported and published in IFS has improved, reflecting assistance provided by STA in the context of the 1998 and 1999 Article IV consultation missions. Starting with the July 1999 issue of IFS, coverage of the banking system was expanded to include private commercial banks established since mid-1992, in addition to the CBM and the four state-owned banks (data coverage of private commercial banks began in June 1992).   8. The quality of monetary statistics could be improved further by: (i) using the market exchange rate, rather than the overvalued official exchange rate, for valuing foreign currency-denominated balance sheet accounts; (ii) reviewing for consistency the interbank accounts showing positions between the CBM and the commercial banks, including the MEB’s currency and financial adjustment accounts, and between different commercial banks; (iii) relying on modern technology for compilation and transmission of the data, to ensure that misclassifications and other mistakes are more promptly detected and corrected; and (iv) reviewing the recording of the Fund accounts in the CBM’s balance sheet to ensure consistency with standard procedures.

Balance of payments (BOP) data have various shortcomings arising from the poor quality of data sources and gaps in coverage of the external transactions of the private sector. The use of the overvalued official exchange rate to convert private sector transactions leads to distortions because these transactions actually take place at or near the market rate. The official trade data exclude military imports, for which no adjustment is made in the balance of payments. Detailed data on services and financial flows are generally not available. There are large discrepancies in the external debt data reported by creditors and debtors. Transactions on arrears are not reported separately.   11. Overall export and import volume and price indices are not fully reported. The export volume and unit value indices computed by the Fund and published in IFS were unsatisfactory and have been discontinued. Data on exports and imports by partner country are reported for calendar years but they lack sufficient detail.   12.  Technical assistance provided by STA in 1999–2000 has resulted in progress by the CBM in improving its balance of payments compilation system. However, the system is not yet capable of producing reliable and comprehensive data. Progress has been mainly confined to streamlining collection procedures of data from various agencies broadening the classification of external transactions, correction of numerous misclassifications in the services component, and compiling data on direct investment income outflows. There have been improvements in the collection of data compiled by commercial banks and data on interest and loan repayments on external debt. No progress has been made, however, in the development of specialized surveys to compile private sector transactions.  13. No progress has been observed in improving the dissemination of BOP data within Myanmar. Other problem areas include the measurement of goods for processing, direct investment capital flows, the classification of short-term liabilities of commercial banks, external debt, and arrears. Data on medium- and long-term external public debt are available, and a breakdown of external debt and arrears by creditor is provided.

MYANMAR: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)  This Annex discusses the current situation of, and outlook for, Myanmar’s public and external debt using the debt sustainability framework (DSF) for low-income countries.11 Myanmar is in debt distress and, despite possible  improvement, is likely to remain in debt distress over the projection period. Myanmar has substantial external arrears, and continues to accumulate more, especially to official creditors. Data on external debt are incomplete and therefore the results of this analysis should be construed only as orders of magnitude.   A. Background  • The most conservative policy-dependent thresholds are applied for this analysis. The low income country DSF provides indicative levels (thresholds) of debt burdens beyond which a country’s risk of debt distress rises significantly. These threshold levels are policy-dependent, and are normally assigned according to the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating. Since Myanmar does not currently have a CPIA rating, for the purposes of this DSA we apply the most conservative thresholds.12  B. Public Debt Sustainability  • Although public debt and debt service ratios improve over the projection period, they are expected to remain very high. Nominal public debt stood at 82 percent at end-2005/06 while the NPV of debt was estimated at 75 percent of GDP, or 1,235 percent of government revenue. These ratios are expected to decline in the next two decades, but this is largely driven by the assumed maintenance of negative real interest rates on domestic debt (see Box 1). Public debt would remain very high should the authorities decide to switch from financing the large fiscal deficits through money creation to public debt issuance. • Sensitivity analysis confirms this result. Not surprisingly, stress tests lead to debt service ratios that are in general higher than the very high levels in the baseline scenario. Even under the most optimistic scenario—higher GDP growth—the NPV of debt-to-GDP remains above 30 percent at the end of the projection period. A one-time 30 percent real depreciation in 2007 has the most negative impact, raising NPV of debt-to-GDP to 109 percent, or 1,607 percent of government revenue in the year it occurs. C. External Debt Sustainability                                                  11 This analysis was conducted by Fund staff only because IDA has no financial relationship with Myanmar. Bank staff, however, provided useful comments. 12 These thresholds, which apply to external public and publicly-guaranteed debt, are: NPV of debt-to-GDP of 30 percent, NPV of debt-to-exports of 100 percent, and debt service-to-exports of 15 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 31 • Myanmar’s external debt-to-GDP stood at 62 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal year 2005. Almost 50 percent of the current stock of foreign debt are in arrears. Bilateral loans, mainly from Japan, constitute 50 percent of the current stock of debt. Debt to multilateral institutions, such as AsDB and IDA, stands slightly above US$1 billion, while the remaining stock of debt consists of trade related supplier’s credits of state economic enterprises and loans from financial institutions.  • Current external debt ratios are in breach of their respective thresholds. NPV of debt-to-GDP and to-exports have been falling in recent years, but remain above indicative thresholds for distress at end-2005/06. By contrast, the debt service-to-exports ratio is 11 percent, below its threshold. Low debt service contrasts with the high stock of debt because only a small proportion are recent and serviceable.  • External debt and debt service ratios would fall below their respective thresholds over the projection period assuming low demand for and supply of external financing. This assumption is sensitive to changes in the policy regime that could significantly increase investment and external financing. At the same time, the assumption that arrears are not repaid (or resolved) may change if this happens.   • Sensitivity analysis point to continued risks over the projection period. Stress tests reveal significant vulnerabilities to changes in the macroeconomic environment . For example, a reduction in the dollar value of the GDP deflator has a substantial impact on the NPV of the debt-to-GDP ratio. The latter peaks at over 80 percent following the described shock, 50 percentage points above the indicative threshold.   Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA The macroeconomic assumptions are as follows:  • Real GDP growth is around 4 percent which is slightly more conservative than staff’s estimate of historical growth. • Inflation increases and is volatile but stabilizes at around 33 percent after 2012. • The primary fiscal deficit is assumed to remain largely unchanged from current level (at about 4.3 percent of GDP in 2006/07). A modest rise is assumed in the revenue-to-GDP ratio to 7 percent in the initial year reflecting efforts to mobilize domestic revenues. • The growth of exports and imports average around 3 percent over the medium term, with a slightly higher growth rate for imports. This is also conservative since in recent years, export growth has outpaced import growth • Current account deficit (including grants): The current account deficit averages around 0.7 percent of GDP, reflecting the restrictions to trade related to the self-sufficiency objective of the government. Net aid inflows remain limited. • Real interest rates on domestic currency debt is somewhat higher than the historical average. • Important caveats: (i) Data are not available or are incomplete; (ii) access to external financing remains limited; and (iii) arrears are significant (almost 50 percent of the current stock of foreign debt).

However, the official growth estimates for 2004/05 and 2005/06—at over 13 percent— appear too high and are inconsistent with other data such as input use (imports of capital goods, fuel, and fertilizers) as well as the observation that workers in urban areas have experienced a deterioration in living standards.   The fiscal deficit has declined to below 4 percent of GDP in 2004/05 with revenue collection relative to GDP reaching 6 percent, from around 5 percent in previous years. This is mainly due to steps taken to improve tax administration, reduce tax evasion, raise the exchange rate used to value imports for tariff purposes, and, more recently, contributions from SEEs. At the same time, spending—which has been consistently                                                  13 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the October 6, 2006 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

The recent increase in wages for civil servants and military personnel is expected to lead to a slightly higher deficit this year.   As the fiscal deficit is almost entirely financed by the Central Bank of Myanmar, inflation—after a pause—has returned to double digits. After falling sharply in 2003/04, monetary aggregates has expanded rapidly because of deficit financing and the receding effects of the banking crisis. In addition, the authorities increased fuel prices by more than 800 percent in October 2005, triggering general price increases. The public sector salary hike has also led to expectations of higher inflation.   The current account surplus has increased rapidly reflecting the surge in gas exports and difficulties in importing goods. Gas exports, which comprise 50 percent of total exports, have followed increases in world gas price which has doubled over the last year. The surplus was sufficient to offset a deterioration in the financial account because of lower foreign direct investment. As a result gross official reserves increased to slightly over US$1 billion (about six months of imports) at end 2005/06. External debt remained at around US$7 billion (60 percent of GDP), about half of which are in arrears.  Myanmar’s official exchange rate is pegged to the SDR at 8.5 Kyat per SDR, while the Foreign Exchange Certificate (FEC) rate is market-determined and has continued to depreciate. Although current account surplus has grown recently, it is difficult to judge the appropriateness of the exchange rate given restrictions on current and capital account transactions.  Despite progress, the banking system has not fully recovered from the 2003 crisis, both in terms of the level of intermediation as well as performance and soundness. Bank intermediation is still below the pre-crisis levels. There is also no significant long-term lending and some restrictions on banking activities introduced during the crisis remain in place.
