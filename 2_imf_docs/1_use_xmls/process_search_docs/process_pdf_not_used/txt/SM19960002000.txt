Summary 1. Background 0 Tunisia has made steady progress in implementing comprehensive structural reforms and has pursued prudent macroeconomic policies. Tunisia is a founding member of the WTO, and in July 1995, it signed an Association Agreement with the European Union (EU) establishing a free trade area over a period of twelve years. l Despite recurrent droughts, real GDP averaged 3.7 percent during the period 1986-95, inflation declined, except in 1995 when it picked up to 6 percent because of the drought, and the external current account deficit was contained at an average of 4.5 percent of GDP. The external debt and debt service ratios have been on a declining trend, and official reserves rose to the equivalent of 3 months of imports of goods in 1994-95. 0 Structural reforms have been wide-ranging and covered trade liberalization, reform of the domestic incentive system, financial sector reform, and privatization. However, the pace of the latter has been slow and is only now being accelerated. l Despite some progress in job creation, unemployment remains relatively high (15 percent), especially in the urban areas. 2. Policy discussions The policy discussions focused mainly on: + the authorities' medium-term strategy under the forthcoming Ninth Development Plan, which seeks to achieve high growth rates and reduce unemployment; + the underlying macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, taking into account the opportunities and challenges arising from the Association Agreement with the EU; and + the prospects and policies for 1996. l The authorities' envisaged medium-term strategy would seek to achieve a real GDP growth rate of 6 percent on average during the period 1996-2001, bring down the inflation rate to 3 percent, and reduce the external current account deficit to about 3 percent of GDP by the year 2001. The balance of payments viability would be strengthened and the external debt indicators would be improved. 0 This strategy would require higher savings--to be achieved mainly through a further reduction in the budget deficit--higher and more productive investments, further structural reforms, and strong gains in export market share as productivity is improved and European standards are adopted in the wake of the implementation of the Association Agreement. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- iv - authorities view the role of this agreement as a catalyst for the reforms under the medium-term strategy. In addition, fiscal adjustment, complemented by continued prudent monetary policy and appropriate exchange rate policy, would be essential in safeguarding macroeconomic stability. l Under an illustrative "moderate growth" scenario, based on less ambitious fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, real GDP growth would average 4.5 percent, and external debt indicators and the unemployment rate would remain virtually stable. l With a view to facilitating the reallocation of capital and labor in connection with the implementation of the Association Agreement, the authorities have launched an industrial restructuring program involving support for individual enterprises as well as improving the general economic environment. The staff representatives emphasized the importance of containing its financial cost and implementing complementary structural reforms aimed at enhancing the functioning of factor markets, fully liberalizing domestic prices, and broadening the scope for private sector activity. 0 The outlook for 1996 is favorable and should provide an opportunity to accelerate structural reforms and reduce external and internal financial imbalances. In light of the expected recovery of agricultural production and a continued export-driven expansion in manufacturing, economic growth is projected at 6.7 percent. The improved supply conditions together with tight financial policies should help reduce inflation to 5 percent. 0 To achieve the targeted reduction in the budget deficit to 2.3 percent of GDP, new revenue measures (mainly concerning the VAT) will be introduced and expenditure growth will be contained. The staff called for prompt implementation of the revenue measures and stressed the need to contain the growth of the wage bill in connection with the forthcoming negotiations between the social partners on a new three-year wage agreement. 0 Regarding structural reforms, trade liberalization will be pursued, including elimination of import tariffs on equipment goods, domestic subsidies reduced, and labor market flexibility increased. While welcoming the envisaged granting of concessions to the private sector, the staff called for a further widening of the scope of privatization. In the financial sector, the authorities agreed on the need to phase out the remaining distortions, rationalize the financial instruments, and develop the secondary market for Treasury bonds. l The database in Tunisia is generally adequate. Further strengthening and increased efforts to improve dissemination and publication are envisaged. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicI. Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Tunisia were held in Tunis during October 23-November 8, 1995. u The Tunisian representatives included the Minister of International Cooperation and Foreign Investment, the Minister of Economic Development, the Minister of Commerce, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Industry, the Minister of Social Affairs, the Minister of Tourism and Handicrafts, the Governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia, the Secretary of State for Agriculture, the Secretary of State in charge of the Civil Service and Administrative Reform and other senior government officials. The mission also met with representatives of the labor union, the employers' association, and the banking sector. Tunisia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. On January 6, 1993, it accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on January 20, 1995 (SM/94/300). 2/ On that occasion, Directors welcomed the progress made by Tunisia in restoring macroeconomic stability, sustaining a favorable growth rate, and diversifying the economy. They underlined the importance of further steps to liberalize the economy, foster competition and flexibility in goods and factor markets, and improve the incentive structure, particularly through further liberalizing foreign trade, strengthening the financial system, and enhancing the scope for private sector activity. The Fund has provided Tunisia with wide-ranging technical assistance, including by the Fund's Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department (MAE) in reforming monetary policy instruments and in establishing an interbank foreign exchange market in 1993 and by the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) in assessing the status of reforms in the tax and tariff systems in 1994. MED staff teams have also assisted the authorities in elaborating and monitoring macroeconomic frameworks and associated quarterly financial indicators. The staffs of the Fund and the Bank have continued to collaborate closely on Tunisia. The World Bank has supported Tunisia's reforms through project-lending and sector loans; a new policy-based loan to support the transition to a free trade area under the recently signed Association Agreement with the European Union (EU) is under'discussion. 1/ The staff representatives were Mr. Jbili (head), Mr. Enders, Mr. Duran, Mr. Chauffour (all MED), and Mrs. Andriantsivahiny (assistant- INS). Mr. Rouai, Assistant to the Executive Director for Tunisia, participated in the discussions. u Tunisia completed a four-year extended arrangement on July 24, 1992, and purchased the full amount available under it (SDR 207.3 million, equivalent to 150 percent of the previous quota).

The core financial data are provided to the Fund on a regular and timely basis. However, there remain weaknesses in the availability of data, particularly in short-term external debt, wages, and employment. Moreover, there have been delays in reporting data on public finances (Appendix VI). II. Backeround to the Discussions Since 1986, Tunisia has made steady progress in implementing comprehensive structural reforms and has pursued consistently prudent macroeconomic policies. The overall fiscal deficit, excluding grants, was reduced from an average of about 5 percent of GDP in 1986-91 to 3 percent during 1992-93. A prudent credit policy was pursued and exchange rate management helped maintain the real effective exchange rate broadly stable. These policies contributed to reducing inflation to 4 percent by 1993, and containing the current account deficit, excluding grants, to about 4.5 percent of GDP on average during 1986-93. The higher external current account deficits in 1992-93 reflected large foreign-financed investment projects in the energy sector- -a gas pipeline to Italy (Gazoduc) and the development of a major offshore gas field (Miskar). Growth averaged 3.8 percent per year during 1986-93, driven mainly by rising exports of manufactured goods and tourism. The key structural reforms included a gradual reduction of nontariff trade barriers, liberalization of domestic prices and of the incentive system, elimination of restrictions on current account transactions, and financial sector reforms. Despite some progress in job creation, unemployment has remained relatively high (15 percent in 1994), reflecting a rapid increase in the labor force, especially in the urban areas. l-J 1. Macroeconomic deVel0DIIEnt.S in 1994 and 1995 During 1994-95, the Tunisian authorities steadfastly pursued economic reforms against the background of two consecutive drought years affecting the cereal crop and olive production. In spite of the recovery in the main European export markets, real GDP growth during 1994-95 fell short of the objectives under the current Eighth Development Plan (1992-96), but was sufficient to bring about an improvement in per capita income. Such an outcome was made possible by the increased diversification of the Tunisian economy during the 1980s and early 1990s and its resilience to adverse weather conditions. lJ Based on internationally accepted definitions, the World Bank estimates the unemployment rate at about 11-12 percent (IBRD, Republic of Tunisia, Towards the 21st Century, CEM Report No. 14375-TUN, Vol. I, October 1995). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 3 - Real GDP growth stood at 3.4 percent in 1994, and is estimated at 3.5 percent in 1995, reflecting continued strong growth in manufacturing industries, mining, and services (Table 1 and Chart 1). This more than offset declining oil production and the sharp contraction in the agricultural sector due to the drought which, by 1995, had reduced cereal and olive production to about one third and a half of "normal" levels, respectively. The drought also fueled an increase in food prices, contributing to a pick-up in inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, from 4.0 percent in 1993 to 4.7 percent in 1994, and an estimated 6.2 percent in 1995. The authorities moved to contain the impact of the drought on the rural sector and the poorest segments of the population. Budgetary resources were reallocated to provide cattle fodder and enhanced sanitary services to rural areas in order to prevent increased migration. In addition, the adjustment of subsidized food prices was delayed out of concern for the social costs of such measures in a period of rising food prices. The drought and lower-than-expected economic growth have somewhat complicated the envisaged fiscal consolidation. The budget outcome in both years fell short of the authorities' fiscal deficit targets of 2.0 and 1.5 percent of GDP in 1994 and 1995, respectively (Table 2 and Chart 2). The overall fiscal deficit, excluding foreign grants, continued to hover around 3 percent of GDP in 1994 and 1995, reflecting only a moderate improvement in revenue and a marginal reduction of expenditure and net lending as a share of GDP. In 1995, total revenue rose by about 8 percent, well below the ambitious budget target of 15 percent, mainly because of lower-than-expected real GDP growth and the non-implementation of the envisaged increase in excises on petroleum products. Total expenditure was held slightly below budget, reflecting lower expenditure on investment and interest payments. The continued growth in the wage bill in both years (8 percent in 1994 and 12 percent in 1995) was due to net recruitment, the normal wage drift, and an annual general increase granted under the three- year wage agreement covering 1993-96. lJ In both years, the overall fiscal deficit was entirely financed by nonbank domestic resources and net foreign borrowing. With a small reduction in outstanding bank credit to the government in 1994, credit to the private sector expanded by 8.7 percent and, taking into account a strong increase in net foreign assets, broad money rose by 7.8 percent, in line with the envisaged target (Table 3 and Chart 2). In 1995, as the weaker growth outlook was confirmed and inflation picked up, the authorities tightened their monetary program in midyear. Based on lJ Three-year wage agreements for the various economic sectors, including the civil service, were concluded in 1993 between the Employers' Association and the Labor Union. They involve general wage increases of up to 6 percent per annum, with possible additional increases linked to productivity gains.

The external accounts improved sharply in 1994, with the current account deficit, excluding grants, narrowing to the equivalent of 2.9 percent of GDP from 7.7 percent in 1993 (Table 4 and Chart 2). This reflected a strong growth of non-energy exports, including large shipments of olive oil stocks at the end of the year, as well as unexpected delays in imports of investment goods. A pickup in worker remittances and tourism receipts and a decline in payments related to the Gazoduc and Miskar projects improved the services balance. For 1995, preliminary estimates point to a widening of the current account deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP. The growth of manufacturing exports remained strong (7.6 percent in volume terms); however, with olive oil exports declining sharply from the exceptionally high level reached in 1994 and energy exports stagnating, the growth of total merchandise exports in volume is estimated at 1.3 percent only. By contrast, the growth of total merchandise imports is estimated to have accelerated to 6.4 percent in volume, mainly driven by higher food and consumer goods imports, as well as higher imported inputs for manufacturing. Net external borrowing rose significantly during 1994-95, reflecting in particular higher public borrowing in the Japanese bond market (yen 85 billion), while foreign direct investment fell with the winding down of the Gazoduc and Miskar projects. The overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of SDR 358 million in 1994 and is expected to record another surplus of SDR 142 million in 1995. Gross official reserves at end-1995 are estimated to remain at the equivalent of nearly 3 months of imports. Tunisia's exchange rate regime is a managed float. During the period 1994-95, the exchange rate of the Tunisian dinar remained virtually stable in real effective terms; the authorities continued to adjust the central rate in the interbank foreign exchange market, taking into account the inflation differential with key trading partner countries (Chart 3). 2. Structural reforms in 1995 4/ Following the efforts at trade liberalization undertaken in recent years, an ambitious agenda for Tunisia's further integration into the world economy within the next decade was set with the conclusion in mid-1995 of an Association Agreement with the EU, involving the establishment of a free trade area over a period of 12 years, as well as enhanced financial and technical cooperation in various areas, including in education, training, and social fields (Appendix II). In addition, quantitative restrictions (QRs) protecting about 9 percent of domestic production, were eliminated in late 1995. u Structural reforms in 1994 were described in detail in SM/94/300, and further information is provided in the background documentation.

Equity shares in two of these enterprises (including Tunis Air) were sold on the stock market. While other nonviable enterprises were liquidated, the restructuring of the remaining public enterprises has continued, and performance contracts have been made mandatory for all state enterprises. Capital account regulations were further liberalized in 1995 by allowing foreign investors to buy without official authorization up to 10 percent of the equity in Tunisian enterprises quoted on the stock exchange, and up to 30 percent for other enterprises. As a further step in the liberalization of domestic trade, distribution margins were lifted on products accounting for about 11 percent of domestic absorption, bringing the share of fully liberalized retail prices to about 81 percent at end-1995. lJ A new comnetition law was adopted in April 1995, aimed at eliminating monopolistic practices and fostering competition; and revisions to the labor law are under discussion (see below). In addition, since 1994, a number of steps have been taken to reinforce the social security regimes, including through increases in contributions, a stricter control on pensions, and the granting of more autonomy to the social security funds in their management and investment decisions. In the financial sector, considerable progress has been made in helping banks strengthen their prudential ratios, in some cases ahead of the timetable set by the monetary authorities. Efforts in this area included capital increases and provisioning, as well as a strengthening of central bank supervision. Implementation of the new stock market legislation was completed in 1995, with the effective transformation of the bourse into a private organization managed by the association of stockbrokers and the establishment of an independent supervisory commission to regulate the activity of the market. Adoption of a modern electronic clearing and settlement system for the bourse is underway, with technical assistance from France. III. Policv Discussions The discussions centered on the authorities' medium-term strategy aimed at achieving a higher and sustainable economic growth and reducing unemployment, taking into account the challenges and opportunities arising from the Association Agreement with the EU. Against this background the prospects and policies for 1996 were reviewed. lJ The remaining products for which price controls are still in effect include subsidized commodities (mainly cereals, edible oils, milk, and sugar), products subject to quantitative import restrictions, petroleum products, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, and all public utilities tariffs.

Medium-term growth strategv In the context of the preparation of the Ninth Development Plan (1997. 2001), the authorities indicated that to reduce unemployment and meet the challenges of increased economic integration with the EU, the economy would need to move to a higher growth path. They were aware that this would require higher and more productive investment in physical and human capital, as well as higher savings in order to safeguard macroeconomic balances. At the same time, further structural reforms would be implemented to facilitate the transition to an open and more dynamic economy, while increased flexibility in labor markets and a reinforcement of education and vocational training would help reduce unemployment. In light of these objectives, the staff discussed with the authorities a quantified "high-growth" scenario for the medium term and the underlying macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. The scenario calls for an acceleration of real GDP growth to around 6 percent during the period 1996- 2001, a gradual reduction of inflation to 3 percent, and a reduction in the current account deficit to about 3 percent of GDP by the year 2001. Taking into account the prospects of increased private capital inflows and grants from the EU, balance-of-payments viability would be strengthened (Table 5 and Appendix I). The authorities explained that the policies underlying their strategy would aim at improving and mobilizing financial savings mainly through a gradual reduction in the overall fiscal deficit, the restructuring and privatization of public enterprises, a reform of savings institutions and social security funds, and the availability of a broader menu of financial instruments. Higher domestic savings would enhance resource availability for investment, which, in turn, would be stimulated by improved incentives and a reduction in uncertainty through the commitment to the ambitious timetable for free trade and economic reform under the Association Agreement. The authorities agreed that strong gains in export market share would be essential for the success of this strategy, which they intended to achieve through (i) the reallocation of resources towards areas of comparative advantage as trade is further liberalized; (ii) rapid productivity gains in the tradables sector, as a result of stepped-up structural reforms; (iii) better market penetration in Europe, which, in their view, would result from the harmonization of norms and standards, the strengthening of transport and communications links, and better access for certain agricultural exports under the Association Agreement; and (iv) a faster absorption of best practices from abroad through the early liberalization of imports of capital goods and the expected higher inflows of foreign direct investment.

Accordingly, the staff representatives developed a "moderate growth" scenario under which real GDP growth would average 4.5 percent over 1996- 2001. Under such a scenario, the external debt and debt-service indicators would not improve, and the unemployment rate would virtually remain stable at its current level. The authorities viewed the Association Agreement as a key ingredient and catalyst for their medium-term strategy; they stressed, in particular, that the trade liberalization and the overhaul and modernization of the regulatory framework would help enhance competitiveness. They also emphasized that the agreement posed a major challenge for the consolidation of macroeconomic stability through its impact on the fiscal and external accounts, as well as the drastic adjustment in the industrial sector to the removal of protection. In particular, they were concerned that the dismantling of import tariffs would result in a cumulative loss of tax revenue, tentatively estimated at the equivalent of 1.7 percent of 1995 GDP over the period 1996-2001. Moreover, pressures on the external current account could intensify as a result of increased imports of consumer goods and of equipment and intermediate goods, the latter in connection with the upgrading of the domestic industry and larger private capital inflows. The staff representatives agreed that a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of the Association Agreement would be needed, including a detailed evaluation of the tax revenue loss by the forthcoming FAD technical assistance mission. IJ b. Macroeconomic nolicies The staff representatives stressed that fiscal adiustment was essential to preserving macroeconomic stability, and that the targeted reduction in the overall fiscal deficit to below 1 percent of GDP by the year 2001 would require considerable efforts, given the need to offset the loss in trade taxes under the Association Agreement. The authorities indicated that they intended to mobilize additional revenues, mostly through a strengthening of the VAT system and improvement in tax administration. The staff representatives encouraged the authorities to formulate a comprehensive package of revenue-raising and expenditure measures, including a reduction in the growth rate of the wage bill, savings on transfers and subsidies, and improved monitoring of other current expenditure. The authorities agreed that progress in fiscal consolidation would provide a basis for continued prudent monetarv policy, which would help bring down inflation toward the level of Tunisia's trading partners. lJ Scheduled to visit Tunisia in early February 1996. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - On exchange rate nolicv, the authorities reiterated their intention to continue their policy of keeping stable the real effective exchange rate of the dinar, underpinned by further efforts at fiscal consolidation and prudent income and monetary policies. Moreover, they felt that improvements in labor productivity would keep costs under control, while the restructuring of the manufacturing sector would help strengthen competitiveness. They agreed with the staff, however, that exchange rate policy should be kept under close review, in particular in view of possible pressures on the balance of payments that may result from the phased removal of tariffs under the Association Agreement. C. Structural policies The authorities were fully aware that the Association Agreement with the EU would entail transitional costs for reallocating capital and labor. They estimated that about a third of manufacturing enterprises would not withstand increased international competition, and another third could face serious difficulties. Accordingly, in an effort to facilitate the transition and maximize the benefits from the agreement, they have launched an industrial restructuring program ("misc a niveau") to help enterprises adapt to the gradual removal of protection (Appendix II). While in agreement with the objectives of the restructuring program, the staff representatives emphasized the importance of containing its financial cost, estimated at D 2.5 billion over the next 5 years (2.2 percent of GDP on average), and facilitating the adjustment and reallocation of labor and capital. The authorities indicated that they were reviewing corporate laws and labor market regulations. To maximize the benefits from the further external opening of the economy, the staff representatives stressed the need to fully liberalize domestic prices and broaden the scope for private sector activity. The authorities stated that further progress would be achieved in the next few years in the areas of privatization and deregulation. All public enterprises in the productive sector would be privatized, except for certain government monopolies, and the process of granting private concessions would be initiated. The staff representatives underscored the need to develop a clear and far-reaching medium-term strategy of public sector disengagement from productive activities, which would provide the right signals regarding the authorities' commitment to privatization and help attract foreign direct investment. Regarding the financial sector, the authorities concurred that the focus would be on promoting financial instruments, in particular the development of secondary markets for Treasury and corporate bonds, and moving toward market-based monetary policy instruments. On trade liberalization, the authorities shared the staff representatives' concern that the agreed phasing of tariff reductions could initially increase effective protection rates in certain sectors. However, they felt that such a phasing would provide some breathing space for enterprises that are being restructured under the "misc a niveau" program, and that tariff reduction for certain consumer products could be Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - accelerated, if necessary, to avoid excessive increases in effective protection. The staff representatives also encouraged the authorities to extend the tariff reductions under the Association Agreement to imports from non-EU sources to avoid the cost of trade diversion. The authorities felt that there was only a limited scope for trade diversion, as a large share of imports from non-EU countries consists of tropical foods, petroleum products, and cereals. They stated, however, that the tariff elimination on certain capital goods, which is to take effect in January 1996, would also apply to imports from non-EU sources, and abolition of the remaining QRs would be extended to imports from all sources. Noting the favorable credit ratings obtained in all major markets in 1995, and consistent with the medium-term strategy, the authorities intend to pursue a prudent external debt policy aimed at diversifying the sources of external borrowing while ensuring a gradual decline in the external debt burden. 1/ Given the limited scope for concessional bilateral borrowing, the shift toward borrowing on international capital markets would continue, with appropriate safeguards against excessive exchange risk. 2. Outlook for 1996 and nolicies A recovery in agricultural output for 1996, continued rapid export- driven expansion in manufacturing, and some pickup in tourism, are expected to contribute to a real GDP growth of 6.7 percent in 1996. In addition, improved supply conditions, together with tight financial policies, should help reduce inflation to 5 percent. The staff representatives underscored that the favorable outlook for 1996 provides an opportunity to accelerate structural reforms and make headway in reducing the fiscal and the external current account deficits and the inflation rate. a. Financial oolicies The draft budget for 1996 calls for a reduction in the overall deficit, excluding foreign grants, to 2.3 percent of GDP, based on revenue and expenditure measures that stabilize the overall revenue ratio and cut expenditure as a share of GDP. Revenue measures include extension of the value added tax (VAT) to large retailers; elimination of the exemption from VAT on capital goods imports; an increase in the VAT rate on petroleum products from 6 percent to the normal rate of 17 percent; and increases in tobacco excises. The authorities expect these measures to more than offset the tax revenue loss from the elimination of tariffs on investment goods (0.3 percent of GDP) in 1996. While capital expenditure is budgeted to rise broadly in line with GDP, the growth of current expenditure is to be held well below that of nominal GDP. The increase in the wage bill is budgeted at 6.3 percent, based on the full-year impact of the wage increase granted in mid-1995 under the current wage agreement and net new recruitment of u In 1994-95, Tunisia obtained an investment grade rating from agencies in Japan, the United States, and Europe. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - 8,000 staff (a 2.5 percent increase from the 1995 level); food subsidies are to be maintained at the 1995 level; and other non-interest current expenditures, notably on health, education, and social security are budgeted to increase by 10 percent. The overall fiscal deficit will be financed entirely by foreign borrowing and domestic nonbank resources. The staff representatives concurred that achieving the fiscal target for 1996 implied significant efforts and welcomed the new revenue measures, which were broadly in line with the recommendations made by an FAD technical assistance mission in October 1994. They stressed the need for timely and effective implementation of the envisaged revenue measures, and urged the authorities to further strengthen the tax and customs departments and reduce the scope for tax exemptions. Regarding expenditure, the staff representatives expressed concern that the new round of negotiations on a three-year wage agreement envisaged for 1996 could result in a stronger- than-budgeted growth of the wage bill, and that expenditure on consumer subsidies could turn out to be higher than estimated in light of the increase in world prices of wheat. The authorities stressed their determination to hold overall expenditure within the budgeted levels, and to further review staffing, wages, pensions, and other benefits within the context of the ongoing civil service reform. They explained that the budget target for expenditure on consumer subsidies would be achieved through adjustments in retail prices of subsidized commodities and a streamlining of the subsidy system. Monetary policy in 1996 would be guided by the need to support the expected economic recovery and contain inflationary pressure. The authorities expected the inflation rate to abate from its level in 1995, which they viewed as temporary and largely related to that year's drought. Nonetheless, they indicated that they would stand ready to tighten monetary conditions, should inflationary pressures persist during the year. Thus, broad money is targeted to grow below the growth rate of nominal GDP, reflecting the increased availability of other financial instruments, and consistent with the inflation and gross official reserves targets. With zero domestic bank financing of the budget deficit, credit to the economy is programmed to grow by 9 percent in 1996. The staff representatives urged the authorities to move away from the current sector-oriented approach in central bank refinancing, and rely on full market-based instruments of monetary control, including a strengthening of the auction mechanism ("appel d'offre"). They also stressed the need to foster competition and discourage collusion among commercial banks ("accords de place"). b. External sector policies With the prospects of continuing economic recovery in Europe, and the completion of the Gazoduc and Miskar projects, the external current account deficit is projected to decline to the equivalent of 4.0 percent of GDP in 1996. Non-energy exports are projected to grow by about 4.4 percent in volume terms, reflecting increased productivity and improved capacity utilization. Imports of non-energy products would grow by 3 percent only, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - as a result of an expected sharp fall in food imports in line with the recovery in agricultural production. Although net capital inflows are expected to decline with the completion of the gas projects, the overall balance of payments is projected to remain in surplus and official reserves to be maintained at the equivalent of about 3 months of imports of goods. The authorities indicated that recent external sector developments and, in particular, continued gains in export market shares and the absence of any parallel market premium, provided evidence that the current level of the real exchange rate was broadly appropriate. Consistent with the medium-term objective of maintaining stable the real effective exchange rate, the overall policy mix in 1996 will aim at containing cost pressures and lowering inflation. The staff representatives stressed the need to keep exchange rate policy under close review in light of the evolution of external balances. On the basis of the first-year experience with the interbank foreign exchange market, the authorities expressed satisfaction with the large share of transactions taking place among banks (80 percent), the smooth functioning of the market, and the rapid acquisition by banks of. the necessary skills and technology. Measures to further liberalize the interbank foreign exchange markets were being prepared, including a wider band around the central bank rate, larger permissible foreign exchange positions for commercial banks, and the establishment of forward markets. C. Structural reforms In the area of trade liberalization, the authorities intend to eliminate the remaining QRs on imports with the entry into effect of the Association Agreement. In addition, the phasing-out of the temporary import surcharges that had been introduced since 1991 will continue on schedule. lJ Finally, import duties on a range of capital goods will be eliminated, including from non-EU sources. The staff representatives underscored the need for a rapid elimination of the remaining QRs. Regarding the domestic incentive system, the authorities plan to continue bringing officially set prices --mainly for subsidized basic consumer goods --closer to market prices, while increasing direct compensation for the poor. In the context of the negotiations on a new three-year wage agreement, they intend to press for more wage differentiation and better links of wage increases to productivity gains, and strengthen the legal basis for part-time employment, fixed-term contracts, more liberal work-time regulations, and a further simplification and shortening of lay-off procedures. The authorities plan to privatize about 20 additional enterprises in 1996 (including large companies in the cement industry) through public offerings. Other enterprises will be liquidated or partially sold through the stock exchange, thereby also stimulating market capitalization and IJ See SM/94/300.

Moreover, they intend to launch in 1996 public tenders for private electricity production and a concession to build and operate the Tunis-Bizerte highway. Performance contracts would be signed with all public enterprises that will not be privatized in 1996. The staff representatives underscored the importance of effective transfer of control and management to the private sector and opening up certain activities to the private sector. Regarding financial sector reform, while the authorities noted the staff representatives' concern that the remaining preferential lending and refinancing rates and the mandatory financing for priority sectors had not been eliminated in 1995, they expressed the intention to phase out these remaining distortions. They also recognized the need to improve the design of treasury paper, develop the secondary market, and harmonize the maturity structure and the yield of various financial instruments. The authorities agreed with the staff representatives that a strengthening of statistics in the areas of public finance, external debt, especially short-term debt, and employment and wages would improve their ability to monitor economic developments and strengthen the formulation of economic policies, while a wider dissemination of key data would help in improving private decision-making. Moreover, they expressed full support for the Fund's efforts to help ensure high standards of publication of economic and financial data. They indicated their readiness to strengthen the collection and provision of data to the Fund for surveillance purposes. IV. Staff Aooraisal The performance of the Tunisian economy in 1994-95, although adversely affected by a recurrent drought, provided further evidence of increased resilience, resulting from greater economic diversification and the pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies. Per capita income increased, macroeconomic stability was safeguarded and the adverse social effects of the drought were contained. Building on the progress achieved in recent years, the authorities intend to sustain higher growth over the medium term, by fostering a market-based, open, and private-sector-driven economy, while consolidating macroeconomic stability. The Association Agreement with the European Union will be a strong catalyst for the required structural reforms, but will also pose a major challenge given the related transitional costs. The staff is encouraged that the authorities are formulating a policy package to support such a strategy in the context of the Ninth Development Plan. Further fiscal consolidation will be central to preserving macroeconomic stability and freeing resources for higher private investment. The staff considers that the fiscal target for 1996 is a first step in that direction, but its achievement will require forceful implementation of the revenue and expenditure measures envisaged. Over the medium term, the gradual loss of tariff revenue resulting from the implementation of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - Association Agreement poses a major challenge. The staff concurs with the authorities' approach to principally develop and strengthen the VAT system through the abolition of exemptions, a broadening of the VAT base, and the adoption of a more uniform rate structure. Other revenue measures will be identified with Fund technical assistance. On the expenditure side, the ongoing civil service reform and the improved monitoring of staffing and recruitment should help contain the growth of the wage bill, while a better targeting of support to the poor should provide scope for savings on consumer subsidies. Fiscal consolidation will also facilitate continued prudent monetary policy to support private sector growth while bringing inflation down towards industrial countries' levels. In this context, the staff notes the authorities' intention to keep their exchange rate policy under close review in light of external sector developments, and emphasizes the need to monitor indicators of external competitiveness. The Association Agreement will entail major labor and capital reallocation as the existing high protection for domestic industry is gradually removed. In parallel with the industrial restructuring program ("mise a niveau"), it will be crucial to strengthen the incentive system, in particular the functioning of factor markets, and put in place the necessary structural reforms to promote higher savings and investment and attract larger flows of foreign direct investment. The staff encourages the authorities to complete the liberalization of domestic orices, in order to maximize producers' ability to adjust to the new challenges and opportunities. An industrial sector that is freed of price controls and rigid labor regulations will be in a better position to withstand the increased foreign competition in the years ahead. The adoption of a modern competition legislation in 1995 provides a basis to phase out remaining direct price and margin controls, and the concomitant trade liberalization process will help prevent the emergence of local monopolies. Greater flexibility in the labor market, especially as regards lay-offs, fixed-term employment, and closer links between wages and productivity will facilitate the reallocation of factors towards sectors of comparative advantage, and thus contain the transitional costs of the trade liberalization program. Trade liberalization needs to be extended to imports from non-EU sources to avoid the cost of trade diversion. The staff welcomes the authorities' intentions to eliminate tariffs on capital goods imports in 1996 on a fully multilateral basis, and extend the planned reduction of QRs to imports from all sources; the staff recommends a prompt elimination of all remaining QRs. Furthermore, the phasing-out of tariffs on final consumer products should be accelerated whenever necessary to avoid excessive increases in effective protection rates in the short run. The scooe of nrivate sector activity needs to be widened. The staff welcomes the recent acceleration in the pace of privatization, but to gain in strength and credibility, the process should be extended to all sectors and to large public enterprises. The authorities' intention to grant Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - concessions to the private sector in building and operating motorways and energy production is encouraging. As the privatization program gains momentum, the staff believes that specific and publicly announced objectives and timetables could help rally support and consensus around such a strategy and provide clear signals to domestic and foreign investors on the authorities' commitment to privatization. Building on the recent reform of the stock market and the strengthening of the banking system through the implementation of tighter prudential regulations, the financial sector reform will need to be deepened in order to provide the necessary support for a high-growth strategy over the medium term. A strengthening of competition among banks, along with a reform of savings institutions and social security funds, will help increase domestic savings and promote the efficiency of financial intermediation. The staff encourages the authorities to foster the development of a deeper secondary bond market, and to move towards fully market-based instruments of monetary control. As significant progress is made in strengthening the financial system, a move to full convertibility would foster integration of the Tunisian economy into world financial markets. The staff is encouraged by the authorities' intention to strengthen the dissemination and publication of economic and financial data, and calls for rapid progress in this area in view of Tunisia's increased integration in the international economy. Tunisia eliminated all restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions in January 1993, except for the maintenance of a multiple currency practice resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended prior to August 1988 to development banks. The Government is not seeking, and the staff is not recommending, approval of this multiple currency practice, which will automatically expire after the existing commitments have matured. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Tunisia be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - APPENDIX I Medium-Term Outlook for the Balance of Payments The medium-term outlook for the balance of payments has been discussed with the authorities in light of their preparatory work on the Ninth Development Plan (1997-2001). While the authorities' work on the latter is still preliminary, the plan aims at achieving an average annual real growth rate of about 6 percent, bringing down inflation to 3 percent, and reducing the external current deficit to around 3 percent. Accordingly, as detailed below, the staff has prepared a scenario along these lines ("high growth"), together with a less ambitious ("moderate growth") scenario. External developments in both scenarios are based on recent World Economic Outlook projections, implying that Tunisia's terms of trade would remain broadly unchanged over the period. Both scenarios assume an unchanged real effective exchange rate throughout the period, the maintenance of gross official reserves close to the equivalent of 3 months of imports, and implementation of the Association Agreement with the EU starting in 1997. The key differences between the two scenarios concern the assumptions regarding the speed and scope of structural reforms and fiscal consolidation. Under the high growth scenario, fiscal consolidation is actively pursued, and structural reforms and the "misc a niveau" program are assumed to proceed at a rapid pace, which would maximize their impact on savings, investment, and productivity. Moreover, the scenario assumes substantial gains in export market share, with non-energy exports growing at some 8 percent on average. This is based on rapid productivity gains in the tradable sector, improved performance on the European market, as standards are harmonized, quality control strengthened, and on aggressive diversification into other markets. By contrast, under the moderate growth scenario, a less ambitious structural reform agenda is pursued, fiscal consolidation is more gradual, and increases in investment levels, savings, and productivity are lower. Non-energy exports are assumed to grow in real terms by around 5-6 percent annually, in line with the projected growth in Tunisia's external markets. 1. Hieh growth scenario Driven by strong growth in the industrial and services sectors, real GDP growth would average 6.2 percent per annum during 1996-2001. Fluctuations around this trend reflect mainly the cyclical behavior of the olive crop and declining petroleum production (due to a depletion of reserves). The share of total national savings in GDP is expected to rise by about 4 percentage points, mostly because of fiscal adjustment. The budget deficit is projected to decline steadily over the period toward balance in 2001, which would be achieved through a gradual decline of current expenditure by about 5 percentage points of GDP over the period, while the tax losses from the elimination of import duties are fully offset. Private savings are projected to remain virtually unchanged despite rising per capita income, reflecting the availability of a new range of consumer Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - APPENDIX I goods because of trade liberalization and some offset of the increase in public savings. While the share of government investment in GDP increases moderately by half a percentage point during the period, nongovernment investment expands by about 2 percentage points of GDP, responding to the opportunities provided by the strong implementation of privatization and other structural reforms, and reduced uncertainty as reforms are "locked in" through the Association Agreement. Investments become also more productive, as reflected in a declining incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) over the period. Thus, the current account deficit, excluding grants, would decline from 4.5 percent of GDP in 1995 to 3.2 percent by the year 2001. Balance- of-payments viability would be maintained over the medium term; external debt outstanding would decline to 45 percent of GDP (from 51 percent in 1995) and the debt service ratio would reach 17 percent of exports of goods and services in 2001, from 18.7 percent in 1995 (Table 6). Reflecting the impact of the Association Agreement and the liberalization of investment regulations in recent years, foreign direct investment is projected to rise annually by an average of 7 percent in SDR terms through 2001. Given the projected improvements in the external debt indicators, Tunisia should have little difficulty in financing the residual gap from official bilateral and multilateral sources, as well as international capital markets. 2. Moderate growth scenario Under the "moderate growth" scenario, investment levels and productivity gains would be more modest and non-energy exports would grow broadly in line with markets, resulting in annual real GDP growth rates of 4.5 percent on average (Table 6). It is assumed that production in the agricultural, mining, and energy sectors is unchanged compared to the high- growth scenario, while the performance of industry and services is broadly in line with past trends. Given lower income and a more gradual implementation of structural reforms, the savings rate would also be somewhat lower than under the high growth scenario. The current account deficit would be less than under the high growth scenario for most of the period and reach 4 percent of GDP in the year 2001, and foreign direct investment inflows would also be lower. The debt service ratio and the debt-to-GDP ratio would remain virtually stable at the 1995 levels over the period. 3. Canacitv to reoav the Fund After reaching a peak of SDR 113 million in 1991, Tunisia's debt service payments to the Fund fell in recent years. Assuming no further use of Fund resources, obligations to the Fund will increase marginally in 1996-97 to reach SDR 44 million in 1997 and decline thereafter through the repurchase period ending in 2002 (Table 7). Tunisia has always remained current in servicing its obligations to the Fund, and its capacity to repay the Fund will remain strong. The medium- term projections under the "moderate growth" scenario show that during Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - ,APPENDIX I 1996-97, when Tunisia's obligations to the Fund will be increasing, these obligations will not exceed 1 percent of current account receipts, 4 percent of total debt service payments, or 4 percent of gross official reserves. Even if external developments turn out to be less favorable than assumed under the "moderate growth" scenario, Tunisia's capacity to repay the Fund should remain strong.

Backeround This appendix reviews the main aspects of the Association Agreement with the European Union (EU), including in particular the establishment of free trade in industrial goods over a period of 12 years. Pending completion by the authorities of a comprehensive and detailed assessment of the impact of the Agreement on various sectors of the Tunisian economy, this appendix attempts to provide some broad indications of the likely impact on growth and financial balances. The EU remairs the most important economic and financial partner of Tunisia; it accourlts for about 80 percent of Tunisia's exports and 70 percent of its imports, and is the primary source of tourism receipts and foreign direct investment. Nearly 80 percent of Tunisia's migrant workers (600,000) live in the EU, and their remittances provide annual foreign exchange inflows equivalent to some 3-4 percent of GDP. Loans from the European 1nvestmer.t Bank (EIB) and bilateral loans from EU-member countries made up about 37 percent of total external debt outstanding at end-1994. In the past two decad.es, the EU also provided grants in the context of its financial protocols with Tunisia. The Association Agreement with Tunisia, which was signed on July 17, 1995, is part of a broader approach of the EU toward deepening and widening its relations with its southern neighbors, with the objective of building a Euro-Mediterraneac. Economic Area. As part of this strategy, the EU also concluded in Novenber 1995 a bilateral agreement with Morocco, and similar agreements are currently being negotiated with other Mediterranean countries. The Barcelona-Conference of November 1995, which brought together the Foreign Ministers of the EU and of most Southern Mediterranean countries, was a major step in this regard. II. The Association Agreement Tunisia's Association Agreement with the EU will enter into effect after its ratification by the European Parliament and the parliaments of Tunisia and the member countries of the EU. The process is expected to be completed in the second half of 1996. The Agreement consolidates key elements of the existing framework (the 1976 trade and cooperation agreement), but adds a number of new features, including, in particular,,a far-reaching liberalization of trade relations and enhanced cooperation in a number of areas. u 'On trade, it substantially improves the EU's access to Tunisia's market, calling for the u See SM/94/300 for a description of the 1976 agreement. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - APPENDIX II abolition of existing trade barriers on industrial goods imports from the Eu. For Tunisian exports, it essentially confirms Tunisia's existing access to the EU for industrial goods, and abolishes the possibility of import ceilings on certain petroleum products that were provided for in the 1976 treaty. It also widens Tunisia's access for agricultural exports compared to the 1976 agreement (as amended in 1987) through extending the list of products eligible for preferential access, while providing for more generous duty reductions within the various tariff-quotas as well as enlarged quotas for certain products. On trade-related policies, the Agreement calls for a comprehensive harmonization of the regulatory framework in many areas, which were absent in the previous arrangement. Also new are the detailed provisions for enhanced cooneration in a number of areas, including on social/immigration issues, the environment, and development of infrastructure. 1. Trade and related nolicies The Agreement provides for the immediate abolition of all quantitative import restrictions (QR); the phasing in of free trade in industrial goods over 12 years; and somewhat extended preferential access for Tunisia's agricultural exports to the EU. Trade in agricultural products will be reviewed after the year 2000, with a view to achieving broader liberalization. Safeguard clauses provide for some limited exemptions from these commitments, inter alia, in case of balance of payments difficulties, social problems, and to protect infant industries. a. Trade in industrial DrOdUCtS Free trade in virtually all industrial products is to be phased in over 12 years; a few exemptions concern mainly artisanal products. Tunisia will phase out all import duties or equivalent charges over a 12-year period according to four different timetables applying to different categories of products (Table 8). Both sides established an "agricultural element" for certain industrial products, which would allow them to maintain tariffs proportional to the content of non-liberalized agricultural inputs in such goods. In case of serious difficulties for a given product, Tunisia may request a revision of the schedule of tariff reduction, but not beyond the 12-year limit, and in case of severe economic and social problems, raise or reestablish tariffs within certain limits for a limited time period. However, in exceptional cases and to protect an infant industry, the Association Council (AC) may authorize Tunisia to maintain tariff protection even after the 12-year period, but only for 3 years at most. b. Trade in apricultural products The Agreement does not provide for a general liberalization of trade in agriculture, but the EU and Tunisia commit themselves to work toward a greater liberalization in this area. The trade regime for agricultural products may be changed through consultation if agricultural policy in either Tunisia or the EU were to change.

Some of these tariff quotas will be raised by 3 percent annually beginning 1997. More modest duty reductions are provided for exports of some of these products in excess of the tariff quota, or outside the specified periods. No reductions are envisaged for the specific duties the EU levies on certain items in addition to the ad valorem duty. A reduced duty of 78 ECU per ton will be levied on Tunisian exports of olive oil for up to 46 000 tons per year through 1999, thus extending the prevailing access conditions for another 4 years. Reductions of import duties on agricultural products from the EU of between 15-43 percent concern mainly edible oils, cereal and dairy products, and meat products, but in most cases, the tariff reduction applies only for specific amounts, again essentially consolidating existing access conditions. C. Rules of origin The rules of origin contained in the Agreement are designed to encourage south-south integration. A minimum transformation of imported inputs is required for a product to qualify as of Tunisian origin; in some cases, this is specified as a maximum share of non-Tunisian components in the value of the finished product, in line with the provisions defining EU origin. For components imported from Algeria or Morocco, requirements for minimum transformation are less stringent, provided that the rules of origin applying to trade with these countries are identical to those of the Agreement. d. Trade-related nolicies Monopolistic practices and public subsidies distorting competition, to the extent they affect trade between the partners, are prohibited under the Agreement. The general criteria and definitions of such practices to be used during the first five years are those of the agreements establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO). Within that period, the AC will adopt appropriate guidelines based on EU law. Government subsidies to enterprises in Tunisia will have to conform to the standards applied for less-developed regions in the EU, with a few exceptions. Public support has to be transparent and well documented. All trading monopolies or special privileges for certain enterprises affecting trade between the partners will be gradually phased out within 5 years. Both parties will adhere to the highest international standards of intellectual property protection and will provide the means to allow Tunisia to use EU norms and technical standards. On this basis, the parties will conclude agreements on the mutual recognition of certification, once the necessary conditions are present. Both parties will progressively and reciprocally liberalize public procurement. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - APPENDIX II 2. Services A general provision calls on the AC to make recommendations towards implementing the principle that firms from each partner may set up business in the territory of the other and establish free trade in services, with progress to be reviewed after 5 years; both parties confirm their commitments under the service agreement (GATS) of the WTO. 3. Movement of canital Subject to a safeguard clause in case of balance of payments difficulties, both parties will ensure convertibility for current transactions and f'or capital transactions related to foreign direct investment, including the repatriation of profits or proceeds of liquidation of investments. Ihey also commit themselves to working towards full convertibility between them. 4. Economic and financial cooneration The Agreement specifies cooperation in a large number of areas with special emphasis on (i) EU support for sectors that will face difficulties to adjust to the trade liberalization; (ii) support for intra-Maghreb regional integration; and (iii) environmental issues. In many areas, the Agreement calls for harmonization of the regulatory environment, especially as regards norms and standards (including in transport and tele- communications), accounting and financial services, statistics, and customs regulations. Cooperation in the area of crime prevention and detection covers money laundering and drug trafficking. Financial support will be provided from EU resources in support of structural reforms in Tunisia, in collaboration with other contributors, in particular the international financial institutions. A declaration attached to the Agreement indicates that if applicatio,n of the Agreement results in serious balance-of-payments difficulties for Tlmisia, consultations on appropriate measures will be conducted in colla>oration with the IMF. 5. Labor and coo3eration on social issues The Agreement provides essentially for the same regulations on the rights and obligat,ions of expatriate workers as the 1976-agreement, i.e. national treatment as regards working conditions, salary and firing rules, and social securit:f. With regard to the latter, Tunisian workers can cumulate working periods in different member states of the EU for the calculation of pension and medical care claims. The new agreement calls for a dialogue on social issues, and identifies priority areas for active cooperation such a:; reducing immigration through regionally targeted development support, concentration of efforts to reintegrate illegal immigrants in the country of origin, promotion of the role of women in development, and slsrengthening of basic social services, especially for women and children.

Economic Imoact of Agreement The Agreement will have an impact on the Tunisian economy through a number of channels. Growth will be strengthened in the long term by static and dynamic efficiency gains, while transitional short-term costs may affect certain sectors and increase unemployment; the magnitude of these factors will depend on the pace of implementation of structural reforms aimed at facilitating the required reallocation of factors of production. Fiscal and external balances may be affected by the phasing out of trade tax revenues and by the response of exports, imports, and capital flows to the liberalization of trade. 1. Imnact on growth and emnlovment a. Static gains from trade liberalization The liberalization of trade envisaged under the Agreement should in principle result in static efficiencv gains over the long run as factors of production are reallocated towards sectors where Tunisia has comparative advantage. A preliminary World Bank-sponsored study on the impact of the Agreement identifies strong growth potential, particularly in textiles and trade services. lJ The overall gains from this resource reallocation are. difficult to quantify and will depend on the extent of trade creation vs. trade diversion, and, thus, the extent of liberalization vis-a-vis imports from non-EU countries, as well as the pace at which labor and capital can be redeployed. Other static gains may derive from economies of scale as producers operate in larger markets. The study finds permanent gains of 1.4 percent of GDP in the long run, while in the short run--modeled as the situation when only labor but not capital would have reallocated--gains are estimated to be negligible. If liberalization was extended to non-EU imports, long-run gains from free trade could increase significantly. b. Dvnamic gains from trade liberalization Apart from static gains from improved resource allocation, dynamic gains may be obtained notably through higher capacity and productivity growth. Both domestic and foreign investment should increase on account of the reduction in uncertainty implied by the adoption of EU standards and regulations, the perceived "locking in" of reforms through the Agreement, and, more generally, the acceleration of the move to a fully market-based and open economy that the Agreement is likely to support. The Agreement would thus enhance the existing investment incentives, such as Tunisia's lJ Rutherford, Thomas E., Elizabeth E. Rutstriim and David Tarr: "The Free Trade Agreement between Tunisia and the European Union, unpublished draft, 1995." The study is being updated and revised and the conclusions reported here are tentative. It is based on a multi-sector computable general equilibrium model of the Tunisian economy that assumes perfect competition and thus excludes economies of scale; the study essentially aims at identifying static gains from the agreement.

The experience of Porl:ugal and Spain points in particular to the likelihood of large inflows of :Toreign direct investment. I-J However, some factors may tend to slow capil:al inflows: the economy may reallocate towards relatively labor-intensive activities in line with its comparative advantage, thus reducing the need for capital; and the Agreement by itself might tilt incentives toward investing in Europe rather than in Tunisia through the "spike wheel effect," as producers in Europe gain additional export access to the Tunisian market. Productivity gains should result from increased competitive pressures, which, in turn, will reduce monopolistic rents and strengthen incent::ves for increased efficiency. Finally, the increased openness of the economy may raise the rate at which best practices and technologies from abroad are absorbed in the economy, thereby raising the long-run growth rate. C. Potential Pains from other aspect of the Agreement Beyond trade liberalization, the envisaged harmonization of trade- related regulations is also likely to have an important impact on the Tunisian economy. For example, significant additional long-run gains can be derived from the adoption of common standards and the upgrading of telecommunication and transport facilities that are envisaged under the Agreement, which could result in better access and prices for Tunisian exports. d. EmDlovrm!nt and transitional costs Higher growth in the long run is expected to result also in a faster pace of employment creation, as Tunisia's comparative advantage is likely to be in labor-intensive sectors. This would also point to the likelihood that real wages will increase and that labor will benefit from the Agreement. However, the real:!ocation of labor and capital towards sectors of comparative advantage will entail transitional costs. The Tunisian authorities have estimated that a third of the existing enterprises in the manufacturing sector could disappear through liquidation or mergers, while another third wil:! face serious difficulties, but could survive if the full potential of the "misc a niveau" program is realized. The transitional costs will depend on the pace of factor reallocation, and thus the pace of structural reform:;. For example, the proposed phasing of the tariff reductions, with tariffs on capital goods (and to a lesser extent intermediary good:;) being phased out faster than tariffs on consumer products, may initially increase distortions and, thus, transitional costs, by raising effective protection rates in sectors producing consumer goods for the domestic market. However, the ongoing phased reduction in compensatory duties (DCP) will to some extent mitigate this effect. I/ See SM/93/2:!4 (Portugal) and SM/94/10 (Spain).

Fiscal impact The Agreement will result in a gradual loss of tax revenue from import duties estimated to reach cumulatively 3.5 percent of 1995-GDP by the end of the 12-year period (Table B), and even more if tariffs on imports from non- EU countries were also to be dismantled. To the extent that the Agreement will result in higher economic growth, these losses may be partially offset by higher revenues from domestic taxes. However, given that import duties and taxes represent about 18 percent of total tax revenue on average, new revenue or expenditure measures will be necessary to avoid a deterioration of the fiscal situation. 3. Impact on savings. investment. and the balance of navrnents The Agreement is likely to result, at least initially, in a deterioration of the savings-investment balance and thus a widening of the external current account deficit. I/ The Agreement is likely to lead to higher levels of investment, as Tunisia expands or upgrades production capacity in the areas of comparative advantage. Regarding savings, and assuming that lost trade taxes are fully offset by revenue or expenditure measures, public savings should not be affected by the Agreement. By contrast, private savings may weaken as the dismantling of quantitative restrictions and tariffs may stimulate private consumption, by making a wider range of consumer goods available, in addition to inducing substitution of domestic consumer goods by imports. Thus, an initial deterioration of the external current account will reflect an acceleration of import growth, because of substitution effects and the increase in overall investment. Since Tunisia gains little additional access for exports under the Agreement, except for some agricultural items, the expected growth of exports will result mostly from a reallocation of resources from import-substituting production into export industries, as well as higher investment levels in these industries. The acceleration of export growth is therefore likely to occur with some delay. The deterioration of the trade balance because of the Agreement, absent any change in the real effective exchange rate, would be contained in so far as increased competition and many other features of the Agreement stimulate faster productivity gains, especially in the tradable sectors. The larger external current account deficits that may emerge during the initial period of trade liberalization could, however, be financed by higher capital inflows, notably in the form of foreign direct investment, as indicated above. IJ This is also consistent with the experience of Portugal and Spain in the years following their entry into the European Community.

Accompanving Reforms The implement:ation of the Agreement will need to be accompanied by a broad agenda of rc.forms for modernization and structural changes in the coming years, in order to maximize the benefits from the Agreement while containing its trz.nsitional costs. In addition to the structural reforms and macroeconomic policies outlined above, a number of accompanying structural reforms, will be essential to facilitate, in particular, the reallocation of c&pita1 and labor toward sectors of relative comparative advantage, and mobilize investment in physical and human capital. 1. AccomDanvine trade liberalization Limiting the abolition of trade barriers to imports from EU sources will introduce new distortions and result in welfare losses due to trade diversion. In prZ.ctice, it may be difficult to differentiate tariff treatment by the c'rigin of imports, and there would likely be a channelling of imports from ncln-EU countries through the EU. Accordingly, tariffs and any other trade barriers should be phased out on all goods simultaneously, to establish undis.torted price signals to guide the restructuring of the economy. Another concern relates to the phasing of the tariff reductions for different catc.gories of goods established in the Agreement, which may initially raise ef'fective protection rates in some sectors. The required adjustment in these sectors could thus be delayed, involving higher transitional costs. The evolution of effective protection rates in each sector therefore needs to be monitored closely and tariff liberalization on finished goods shcluld be accelerated, if warranted, to avoid initial increases in effec.tive protection. 2. Mise B niveal! The authorities have elaborated together with the EU and the World Bank a major industrial restructurinp ProBram ("misc B niveau") to help viable industrial enterprises adapt to the removal of protection. To some extent, the program is ins,pired by a similar approach undertaken in Portugal to prepare for and at!apt to membership in the EU. It involves two components: support for eligible individual enterprises, and improvements in the economic environmc.nt in which enterprises operate. To qualify for individual support:, enterprises have to present a comprehensive restructuring strz.tegy based on an audit by an independent consulting firm and judged bankable by a local bank; it could then apply for limited financial support for physical investment or upgrading of its production facilities, as well as for recapitalization. Another component of the program includes improvements in infrastructure, creation of new industrial parks, additional vocational training programs, and a strengthening of the technical centers (centres techniaues) that are being developed in each sector. The "centres techniques" aim at facilitating access to modern technology, helping enterprises upgrade their accounting and management practices, and assisting them in gaining access to new export markets as well as developing; their own marketing skills. The centers are to be managed largely bJp the private sector, through sectoral associations.

Its financing will be from budget resources (through levies on the industries concerned) and contributions from the EU and the World Bank. 3. Investment in infrastructure and human capital development The ability of the Tunisian economy to maximize the benefits from the Agreement will also depend on the quality of physical infrastructure and the level of development of its human capital. The Agreement provides for close cooperation with the EU and financial support in upgrading and harmonizing transport and communication facilities. Human capital development will also be a key factor determining the rate of absorption of technological progress, and Tunisia can build on a good record of educational achievements. For the medium term, the focus will be on the training of the existing work force to help it adapt to the reallocation of production, through appropriate vocational training programs as planned, for example, under the "mise a niveau" program; other more long-term goals in the areas of education and employment are to be developed in collaboration with the World Bank.

Since March 1, 1994, the exchange rate of the Tunisian dinar (TD) among the commercial banks is determined in an interbank foreign exchange market. The Central Bank trades in the market within a margin of 1 percent around its central rate. At end-December 1995, the interbank rate of the dinar vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar was US$l = TD 0.951, equivalent to SDR 1 = TD 1.41. 8. Article IV Consultation Tunisia is o:n the 12-month cycle.

As of January 18, 1996., the-sector shares of the Bank Group commitments were as follows: agriculture (16 percent), industry and energy (14 percent), transport and infrastructure/water resources (27 percent), human resources (11 percent), financial sector (5 percent) and nonsector adjustment loans (27 percent). Bank lending at first emphasized support for long-term investment in infrastructure and social industrial financing. From 1986 to 1991, Bank lending supported increasingly policy reforms at the sector and macroeconomic levels. Agricultural policy reform was supported by a US$lSO million Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan approved in September 1986, followed by a second such operation in 1989 for US$SO million, to which an investment component of US$34 million was attached. An Industry and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan was approved in February 1987 and supported the first phase of implementation of the Government's program of industrial and trade policy reforms. In June 1988, the Bank approved a Structural Adjustment Loan, which supported price and trade liberalization, fiscal reform, and improvements in the interest rate structure, and in mid-1989, it approved a US$130 million Public Enterprise Restructuring Loan. An Economic and Financial Reforms Support Loan (EFRSL) was approved in December 1991, for the amount of US$250 million, to overcome the balance-of-payments effects of the Gulf crisis and to support the completion of the liberalization of the economy. Project implementation has been generally satisfactory and, in a number of sectors, important policy changes and institutional improvements have been achieved, and autonomous agencies have been created or strengthened to ensure the efficient management of the related sector or subsector. The amount of undisbursed funds as of January 19, 1996 was US$681 million. The Bank will continue its lending program committed at around US$250 million per year. The projects under preparation support health, private sector development, agriculture and rural credit, environment, education, the management of water resources, infrastructure, and industrial financing. The Bank is considering a new policy-based loan to support the implementation of the Free Trade Agreement with the EU.

Most of those data are also published or made available to the wider public. However, further improvements in the coverage, and timeliness of economic data would be important to facilitate analysis and the monitoring of current economic developments. 1. Real sector The coverage of data on real sector developments is satisfactory and most data are reported in a timely manner. However export and import price and volume indices are reported only quarterly with some delay. It would be important to collect and report data on employment and wages on a regular basis. 2. Government finance The latest GFS data received from Tunisia are provisional for 1991 and forecasts for 1992. Government finance statistics for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook have not been reported since 1993. Data reported for 1990 and 1991 exhibit some discrepancies with the data collected by area department missions. Tunisia does not report monthly or quarterly data for publication in the IFS. 3. Balance of navments There is a need for comprehensive recording of short-term external debt.
