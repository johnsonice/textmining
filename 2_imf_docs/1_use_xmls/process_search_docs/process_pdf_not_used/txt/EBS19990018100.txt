Discussions for the 1999 Article IV consultation and the mid-term review under the third annual ESAF arrangement (ESAF III) began during May 4 -13, I999 and were concluded during July 6 - 19,’ following a change in government after parliamentary elections on May 30, 1999. On June 18, 1999, the new government presented to parliament the main principles of its economic program, which followed closely the policies approved under ESAF III. * Understandings on a revised program for the remainder of 1999 were reached in early July. The delay in completing discussions on the mid-term review also delayed the second disbursement of the World Bank third Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC III), originally scheduled for end-June 1999. 2. A three-year arrangement under the ESAF was approved by the Executive Board on February 14, 1996,3 in an amount equivalent to SDR 101.25 million (150 percent of old quota). ESAF IQ4 supporting a program for the period October 1998-December 1999 was approved on December 21, 1998 in an amount equivalent to SDR 41.85 million (62 percent of old quota), and Armenia received the first disbursement equivalent to SDR 20.925 million shortly thereafter. At this time, the Executive Board augmented the ESAF arrangement by SDR 8.1 million, to SDR 109.35 million. Armenia’s relations with the Fund are detailed in Appendix I. 3. The second disbursement under the current arrangement is contingent on observance of the end-March 1999 performance criteria and completion of the midterm review. In the attached letter of intent and supplements to the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and its Technical Annex (Attachment), the Armenian authorities describe the difficulties encountered in implementing the program. They also describe the measures- i The statfteams included Mr. Valdivieso (Head), Messrs. Wakeman-Linn and Semblat, and Ms. Li (all EU2), Messrs. Almeida and Sobolev (both PDR), Mr Hirschhofer (FAD), Ms. Nikdjou (Assistant EU2) and Ms. Orihuela (Assistant RES). Mr. Anayiotos, the resident representative, contributed to the work of the missions. Mr. Azoulay (Advisor to Mr. Wijnholds) participated in the first round of discussions. 2 The missions met with President Kocharian; Prime Minister and former Minister of Defense Sarkissian; Minister ofFinance Barkhudarian; Central Bank Chairman Sargsian; Minister of Economy and former Prime Minister Darbinian, Minister of Energy Zadoyan; other ministers and senior officials; Speaker of Parliament Demirchian; representatives from commercial banks and the private sector; and ambassadors of key donor countries. ‘See EBS/96/12 (l/25/96), Supplement 1 (l/29/96) and EBD/96/8 (l/23/96). %ee EBS/98/213 (12/8/98), Supplement 1 (12/8/98) and Supplement 2 (12/18/98).

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on February 6, 1998 (EBS/98/14, l/23/98). At that time, Directors noted Armenia’s good track record of macroeconomic performance and structural reforms, while expressing concern at setbacks in 1997. Directors stressed the importance of maintaining a prudent fiscal policy, commended the tightening of monetary policy, and considered appropriate the government’s intention to allow the exchange rate to reflect underlying market pressure. Directors noted that, while some structural elements of the program had fallen behind schedule, positive action had been taken in privatization. Directors welcomed the financial rehabilitation plan for the energy sector. 5. In the last few years, Armenia has received extensive financial and technical assistance from multilateral institutions, including the Fund, World Bank and EBRD.’ On August 26, 1997 the World Bank’s Executive Board approved a country assistance strategy (CAS) for the following three years, which envisaged lending up to US$260 million from blended resources. The Bank’s Executive Board approved SAC III in an amount equivalent to SDR 46 million (US$65 million) on December 22, 1998, and the first disbursement of US%15 million took place shortly thereafter. The second disbursement under SAC III-US%25 million-is contingent on bringing the ESAF program back on track. 6. The Armenian authorities report to the Fund on a regular basis the minimum core data used for surveillance (Appendix IV). While there has been noticeable improvement in the production and dissemination of economic and financial information, the timeliness and quality of data relating to the economic activity and finances of local governments and major state- owned enterprises remain a problem. The authorities have indicated their intention to meet the requirements of the GDDS. With regard to the Y2K problem, the Armenian Y2K Commission has confirmed that compliance tests have been completed for key government agencies (the Ministries of Finance, and Statistics, and the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA)), and compliance tests for commercial banks and key non-bank enterprises, such as the telecommunications company, are expected to be completed in October.

All end-June 1999 benchmarks, which were revised during the May discussions, were observed, except for an additional accumulation of arrears on payments of core expenditures. There was also a small deviation from the end-June indicative dram broad money target. 8. Most of the structural measures have been implemented, although in some cases only partially or with considerable delay (Text Table 2). By end-March 1999, the High Level Commission on Tax Arrears had settled 54 of the 60 largest tax delinquent cases, thus meeting the only structural performance criterion for that date. With respect to end-March and end-June benchmarks, measures to improve treasury management, prepare the background for civil service reform, and conclude the sale of the government’s residual shares in a major commercial bank, were implemented as programmed. In contrast, there were delays in developing a strategy for the use of privatization proceeds, in completing the audit of the Savings Bank, and in disseminating full information on external grants and loans. In addition, the authorities did not complete the planned restructuring of the energy sector’s overdue payments to domestic creditors and-contrary to program commitments-used noncash netting operations to meet the electricity collections targets. 6 While the Armenian authorities were originally of the view that they met the end-March 1999 target for NIR, it was subsequently clarified that the reported reserves incorrectly included fimds held on behalf of the energy sector to pay for (in early April) the sector’s external debt. The definition of reserves in the supplementary technical annex has been clarified accordingly. ’ There were difficulties in assessing performance relative to the arrears target for end-March 1999, due to reclassification of some expenditures. To improve the monitoring of expenditure arrears, the staff reached understandings with the authorities on a simpler and broader definition of arrears, covering all verified government obligations, starting with the end-June indicative target. For certain recurrent expenditures-wages, family allowances, and pensions-arrears are defined to be payments not made in the month in which they fall due. For all other expenditures, arrears are defined as payments more than 30 days overdue. Reporting for the first group is expected to take about 1 month, whereas reporting for the second group is expected take 45 days.

Economic growth in 1999 has sloweri, rej7ecting the adverse effects of the Russian crisis and of the drought on agriculture (Table 4 and Figure 1). Following a 7.2 percent increase in real GDP in 1998, driven by agriculture, construction and trade, output in the first six months of 1999 was about 5 percent higher than a year earlier. While construction and trade continued recording strong growth in the first half of 1999, industrial output grew moderately, transport virtually stagnated and agriculture declined modestly, partly due to the drought. 10. Consumer price inflation picked up somewhat in late 1998, to around I percentper month, afrer having declined steadily in thejirst three quarters of 1998. ’ The increase in inflation was the result of an easing of monetary policy in late 1998 and the associated depreciation of the dram exchange rate. Consumer prices have been broadly unchanged since February 1999. On a twelve-month basis, CPI inflation was 3.2 percent at end-July 1999. 11. Recorded unemployment hos increased somewhat and the growth in real wages has slowed down Officially recorded unemployment as of May 1999 was estimated at slightly above 11 percent of the labor force, almost 2 percentage points higher than a year earlier.” After rising between 1995 and 1998 at an average annual rate of more than 20 percent, real wages increased by 13 percent in the tirst six months of 1999, compared to the same period a year earlier. Despite this trend, monthly wages in the state sector were still among the lowest among the Baltics, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union (Figure 2). B. Fiscal policy and Social Safety Net 12. Theprogram limits on the cash deficit in 1998 and thejirst half of 1999 were met, but expenditure arrears accumulated as tax colleti’ons and erternaljinnncing were lower than budgeted The state budget cash deficit (measured from the financing side) which was estimated at 5 percent of GDP in 1998, about 1 percent below the program target, declined further in the first half of 1999 to only 3% percent of GDP-2% percentage points below the program target (Tables 5 and 6). Lower than anticipated tax revenues and project financing s For a more comprehensive discussion of recent developments see the forthcoming Recent Economic Developments paper. ’ Food prices actually declined every month in the second and third quarters of 1998 lo While part of the increase in unemployment reflects a rising rate of participation, the number of employees and vacancies declined in the first half of 1999.

As a result, there were delays in payments, and by the end of 1998 the outstanding stock of core expenditure arrears had reached dram 2.2 billion (about 0.2 percent of GDP). The extent and scope of expenditure arrears increased in the first half of 1999, as a result of both an intensification of the revenue shortfall,” and further shortfalls in both domestic and foreign financing. By end-June 1999, the stock of expenditure arrears amounted to about dram 11 billion (about 2.2 percent of GDP), of which about dram 3.5 billion were in core expenditures (i.e., wages, family allowances, pension and employment t%nd contributions, and health). On a commitment basis, the state budget deficit, which was 5 percent of GDP in 1998, rose to above 5 % of GDP in the first half of 1999. 13. The weakening of tau revenues was due to unexpected shifts in the base for indirect taxes, rising evasion, and lower than anticipated growth and infatio~ Import substitution for cigarettes and flour lowered customs revenues and heightened the difficulties faced by the tax administration authorities in collecting from domestic companies producing import substitutes. In addition, expectations of tax amnesties ahead of the elections, coupled with increasing difficulties in collecting taxes from some large state-owned companies caused tax arrears (excluding penalties) to grow from about 13 percent of annual tax collections at end- 1998 to 17 percent at end-June 1999. The weakening of revenues has taken place despite reported advance payments of taxes which, according to the Ministry of Revenue, have been limited and voluntary. In addition, in early 1999 the government began using negotiated tax payments to collect from some of the most difficult to assess taxpayers, but the outcome was unsatisfactory and the scheme was abandoned. 14. Budgetfinancing shortfalls were the result of exogenous faciors, policy decisions and institutioml weaknesses. Difficulties in catalyzing domestic financing reflected a decline in foreign demand for treasury bills as a result of the Russian crisis, and attempts by the Treasury to contain interest cost overruns (see paragraph 21). External financing shortfalls reflected slow execution of ongoing projects and delays in meeting SAC III conditionality, which alone created a financing shortfall equivalent to almost one month of taxes. 15. Local governments have also been facing di~culties in executing their budgets, Continued tax administration problems have been accentuated by a decline in agricultural income, due in part to the drought. Following a disappointing performance in 1998, revenue in the first half of 1999 was almost 20 percent higher than a year earlier but only one fourth of the budgeted annual amount. As a result, expenditures for goods and services have been much lower than anticipated, but there is no information on expenditure arrears, I’ The end-March 1999 tax revenue performance criterion was missed by about 11 percent, and the interim benchmark for end-June 1999 agreed during the May mission, which was set 6% percent lower than in the original program, was barely met.

Revenue collection problems extended to the State Fundfor Social Security as well, and arrears on pensions benefits have mounted Since late 1998, the SFSI has been experiencing difficulties in collecting contributions from the state budget (reflecting under- budgeting)” and state-owned enterprises (reflecting accumulation of wage arrears).i3 As of end-June 1999, pension arrears amounted to dram 3.5 billion, or more than 1% months of pension payments. Efforts to reduce contribution arrears, including confiscation and initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, have increased in recent months. 17. A single means-testedfamily allowance was introduced in January 1999, in part to cushion poor families against the impact of the January 1, 1999 increase in electricity tariffs. The experience has been positive; payments have generally been made on time, although arrears occurred in June. The system provides an average monthly support of about US%1 5 to about 230,000 families. Slight changes to the means-testing parameters have been introduced in the course of 1999, and the role of local government in the distribution ofbenefits has increased. C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy 18. The expansion of monetary aggregates became erratic in late 1998 and the first harfof 1999, reflecting the authorities’ attempts to avoid largefictuations in the nominal evclrange rote (Table 7 and Figure 3). Through the first three quarters of 1998, tight monetary policy contributed to declining inflationary pressures and a stable exchange rate. During this period, the stock of reserve money was essentially unchanged, and the observed rise in broad money resulted from an increase in the multiplier due to a decline in the currency/deposit ratio. The monetary policy stance changed in the fourth quarter, as pressures from the Russian crisis led the CBA to expand credit. After hovering around dram 500 per U.S. dollar for the first eight months of 1998, pressures on the exchange rate began to be felt in September. The authorities intervened in the interbank market and the depreciation of the dram relative to the U.S. dollar was contained to about 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998. 19. The lagged effect of the credit expansion in 1998, coupled with a decline in required reserves (due to noncompliance), putfurtherpressure in theforeign exchange I2 Since January 1, 1999, budgetary obligations to the SFSI increased from 28 percent of the projected wage bill to about 34 percent, as some budgetary wages fell below the new minimum threshold used in assessing the 28 percent contribution. I3 The contributions to the SFSI are calculated on the basis of paid wages, not accrued wages.

After this, the expansion of CBA net domestic assets was kept at about half the rate of growth envisaged in the program and there was some rebuilding of net international reserves, but not enough to meet the end-March program target. Monetary aggregates began expanding gradually in April, reflecting the CBA decision to extend direct lending to the government in anticipation of the disbursement under SAC III, breaching a basic tenet of the program. However, this expansion was met by a recovery in the demand for money and as a result the exchange rate appreciated to about 540 per U.S. dollar at end-June 1999, from about dram 558 per U.S. dollar at end-January 1999. Throughout this latter period the CBA has seldom intervened in the foreign exchange market, 20. Since August 1998, the dram has undergone a real effective appreciation of about 10 percent (Figure 4). While Armenia’s real effective exchange rate vis-ii-vis non-BR0 countries has remained broadly unchanged, it has appreciated sharply vis-&is BR0 countries (Figure 4). Thus, even though Armenia’s average monthly wage of US%33 is only above that of a few BR0 countries (Georgia, Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic), the competitive margin of Armenian exports in relation to its neighbors has been eroded. 21. Monetary management was complicated by the contagion effect of the Russian crisis on the treasury bill market andgovernment attempts to control interest rates. After the onset of the Russian crisis, there was a sharp decline in market participation (particularly by nonresidents), a shortening of maturities, and rising yields (Figure 5). Starting in February 1999, however, there was an increase in market participation by non-bank residents, partially offsetting declining participation by commercial banks. The increased non-bank presence helped limit the increase in yields somewhat, but it has not been sufficient to offset the declining participation by non-residents. Despite a clear market preference for short maturities, the government sought to issue longer term bills while trying to keep interest rates close to the levels assumed in the budget. As a result, in 21 auctions in the first seven months of 1999, total bids averaged 37 percent less than the amount offered. Moreover, in about half of these 21 auctions the MFE turned down on average 20 percent of these bids in an attempt to control interest rates. D. Banking Sector 22. The quality of loanportfolios of the banking system has deteriorated somewhat, but there has been a reduction in the exposure to foreign exchange risk and overall capital adequacy remains high (Figure 6). Commercial banks’ non-performing loans, atIer hovering around 8 percent of total loans for the first 9 months of 1998, increased to about 11 percent at end-May 1999. This deterioration has been particularly noticeable in banks with large l4 At its peak (in November 1998 and January 1999), official monthly intervention averaged close to 5 percent of gross international reserves, or 14 percent of reserve money.

The profitability of the banking system had deteriorated in early 1999, reflecting increased provisioning in the first quarter, but recovered in the second quarter to levels comparable to 1998. Banks have significantly reduced their exposure to foreign exchange risk in anticipation of the reduction in the limit on the foreign open position to 30 percent of capital, which became effective on April 1, 1999. The system also increased its capital base to meet the higher general (12 percent) and core (8 percent) capital requirements which entered into effect May 1, 1999, and an increase in selected risk weights. Consistent with reduction in the vulnerability of the banking system and the recovery of profitability in the second quarter of 1999, the intermediation margins have stabilized and the risk premium (as measures by the spread between dollar deposit rates in Armenia and in euro- markets) has started to decline after a rise early in the year. 23. A few cases of forbearance of prudential requirements raise questions about the adequacy of the structure of penalties for noncompliance and the independence of the regulatory and supervisory authority. Throughout the first half of 1999, some banks have not met the legal reserve requirements, as they preferred to pay the penalty rate (equal to the CBA refinance rate) and use these resources to buy treasury bills. Other banks linked their inability to meet prudential requirements to large nonperforming loans to the energy sector (some of which are guaranteed by the government). Still other banks have not met the capital adequacy ratio and the limit on the open foreign exchange position.‘5 Two banks, with the consent of the government, extended loans to a state owned enterprise equal to several times their capital, in violation of the limit on lending to an individual borrower. E. Balance of Payments and External Financing 24. The impact of the Russian crisis on Armenia’s exiernal trade has been larger than anticipated, but it is beginning to ease (Table 8 and Figure ;3. Total exports fell more than 25 percent in the second half of 1998 compared to the same period in 1997, much faster than anticipated, particularly to BR0 countries. In the first half of 1999, however, exports were only 5 percent lower than a year earlier, in line with program projections. In contrast, imports in the second half of 1998 were 1 percent higher than in the same period of 1997, but have fallen 8 percent in the first half of 1999, more rapidly than envisaged. 25. The current account deficit inpercent of GDP has continued to decline, despite ihe adverse effect.5 of the Russian crisis, but less rapidly than anticipated. The larger trade deficit, combined with a sharp reduction in workers’ remittances, mainly from Russia, resulted in a current account de&it of 27 % percent of GDP in 1998, 3 l/2 percentage points higher than programmed but still lower than in the previous year. The increase in net exports in the first half of 1999, together with a slight recovery in private transfers, resulted in a current I5 In one case, a bank with heavy exposure to a large state owned enterprise has been in violation of some prudential regulations since July 1998.

Foreign direct investment, mostly associated with privatization operations, continues to be the main source of financing, followed by trade credits and official multilateral sources. FDI intlows reached IL%220 million in 1998 (US%80 million more than programmed). Many FDI proposals under discussion in 1998 were deferred due to the Russian crisis and, as a result, FDI inflows slowed noticeably in early 1999, and have begun to recover only recently. 26. Efforts to improve theprofile of external debt continue. Following the restructuring of ECU 5 1 million in debts to the EU, the renegotiation of the US%35 million Russian loan for the energy sector, and the withdrawal of the CBA guarantee on a US%7 million, three-year nonconcessional loan, the stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt has been kept at around 44 percent of GDP since end-1997, reaching US%810 million at end-June 1999, compared to US$855 million assumed under the program.16 Excluding these loans, Armenia has contracted only concessional loans and, as a result, the net present value of Armenia’s contracted public and publicly guaranteed debt in relation to GDP declined to 29 percent at end-1998, more than 4 percentage points lower than at end-1997. The debt service ratio has remained at around 13 to 14 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services throughout the period from end-December 1997 to end-June 1999, although it is expected to rise to about 16 percent under the program. 27. Armenia continues its efforts to join the WTO and maintains a liberal trade regime. During the first half of 1999, significant progress was made in the negotiations on Armenia’s accession to the WTO, which have now entered the tinal stage. A new law on customs duties became effective in January 1999, revising the tariff rates on some products but keeping the average tariff at around 4 percent. These adjustments aimed at bringing the tariff schedule more in line with the original strategy of applying a zero rate to inputs and 10 percent to final goods.” F. Structural Policies 28. Theprivatizationprocess has continued, albeit at a slowerpace. After significant deals were closed in the first three quarters of 1998, international sales slowed in late 1998 and early 1999, in part reflecting the impact of the Russian crisis. Following a 6-month deferment in the option to buy, the sale of the brandy factory was concluded in June 1999. In i6 Armenia’s total external debt declined from 49 percent of GDP at end-1997 to 44 percent of GDP at end-June 1999 as a result of the privatization of the telecommunications company, and the conversion of its unguaranteed external debt into equity. ” There are two tariff rates in Armenia, zero and 10 percent. The changes increased the rate from zero to 10 percent for some products, and decreased it from 10 to zero for others. The increases outnumbered decreases, so the average tariff rate increased marginally. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - addition, during the first half of 1999 the government concluded the sale to strategic foreign investors of a chemical plant, a precious stone processing company, and a hotel. Thus, while privatization proceeds amounted to 4 percent of GDP in 1998, they were only 3 % percent in the first half of 1999. Attempts to sell small and medium-size enterprises have continued, but actual sales declined considerably. As called for in the program, the government sold its residual shares in Ardshinbank, and completed the sale of all but one of the bakeries and flour mills. The government is seeking to find alternative ways to deal with a number of enterprises which did not sell on the first attempt; rather than proceeding with subsequent sales attempts, the government has requested the World Bank to assist in finding ways to restructure these enterprises to make them more attractive. 29. There have been some efficiency gains in the energy sector. Using administrative measures, the sector was able to reduce technical and other losses (including theft) in the last few months of 1998. These improvements were maintained in the first part of 1999. It is expected that commercial losses will be reduced further once the ongoing process of installing USAlD-funded meters is completed by February 2000. Technical and commercial losses are also expected to decrease t+ther as the rehabilitation of the electricity transmission and distribution system is completed over the next four years. The government made substantial progress, with the assistance of the World Bank and other donors, in preparation for the privatization of power distribution companies. In July, the government made a public commitment to complete the privatization tender for the largest distributor (Yerevan Distribution Company) before the end of 1999 and to follow up with privatization of three remaining distribution companies. Privatization of distribution would be a major step toward sustainable financial recovery in the energy sector. 30. The envisaged increase in electrkity collections has not materialized and there has been a worsening offinancial discipline in the sector, Cash collections declined from 77 percent in 1998 to 67 percent in the first half of 1999, well below the target of 89 percent. Netting-out operations were used to achieve the target collection rate during the first half of 1999.” The low cash collections, together with a shortfall in working capital due in part to a rephasing of a World Bank/OECF loan, gave rise to an accumulation of arrears on payments to the budget, social security, and wages during the first 6 months of 1999. As a result, the stock of overdue domestic debt of the sector increased from about dram 83 biion at end- 1998 to almost dram 100 billion at end-July 1999. 31. Efforts to enhance theproductivity of the civil service have continued in line with the understandings of the program. A survey of the number of employed persons, by grade and ministry, has been completed, as has a comparator pay survey and pilot surveys in the ‘* In April and May 1999, the government conducted a series of noncash operations that effectively netted out overdue debts of the energy sector for overdue receivables of the sector, contrary to the understandings of the program.

The authorities have continued to work closely with the World Bank in an effort to design policies to strengthen the civil service. IV. POLKYDIS~~SSIONSANDREVISEDPROGRAMFORTEESECOND~LFOF~~~~ A. Overview of Discussions 32. In view of the developments in the first half of the year, policy discussions focused on the content, timing and sequence of the corrective measures needed to bring the program back on track. I9 Both the outgoing and incoming administrations acknowledged that the environment for policy implementation had deteriorated considerably in late 1998 and the first half of 1999. The authorities concurred with the staffs assessment of the extent of the large fiscal (3 sA percentage points of GDP) and energy sector imbalances (5 percentage points of GDP before debt restructuring) and the apparent slowdown in the drive for structural reform However, while recognizing the impact of political uncertainty in the run-up to the parliamentary elections and the problems emerging from policy slippages, particularly those related to the energy sector, they considered the main problem to be the intensity and duration of adverse external factors. The new authorities are acting decisively in implementing the revised program for the remainder of 1999, especially seeking the approval of an amended 1999 budget which could reflect their choice to reduce budgeted expenditures to make room for additional transfers to help close the gap in the energy sector, and avoid an additional increase in electricity tariffs in 1999. B. Program Objectives 33. The program envisions a GDP growth rate in 1999 somewhat below 4 percent, close to the original program, while aiming to contain inflation to no more than 8 percent during the year (down from the program target of 10 percent). To achieve these targets, the authorities are committed to adopting a policy mix which calls for front loaded fiscal and quasi-fiscal corrections and a tightening of the domestic credit stance, accompanied by efforts to revive and deepen structural reforms. The program calls for greater reliance on market forces to determine interest and exchange rates, maintenance of a liberal trade and payments system, and preservation of orderly relations with external creditors. ” The discussion on the policies for the medium term and the main elements of the medium term framework are presented in Section V. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - C. Fiscal Policy 34. The state and republican cash budget deficid” will be limited to around 6 percent of GDP in 1999, unchanged from the original program. Given the earlier revenue trends and fiscal and quasi-fiscal expenditure pressures, these limits, in the absence of corrective measures, would have been exceeded by about dram 38 billion, or 3% percent of GDP. Almost 45 percent of this fiscal gap would have arisen on account of revenue shorttklls (as well as reduced nominal financing, in line with the lower programmed nominal GDP). The rest would have come from higher than budgeted expenditures related to domestic interest payments, additional transfers, and the government’s decision to increase support to the energy sector--due to nonpayments by budget and budget-supported organizations-instead of increasing electricity tariffs in the remainder of 1999.” Since July 1999, the government has taken steps to close about one-third of the fiscal gap through revenue-increasing measures, and two-thirds through expenditure and net lending reducing measures. The specific measures are described in the Attachment and their projected yields are presented in Text Table 3. Table 3: Measures to Close the Fiscal Gap BillIon Dram Percent of GDP 1.

As discussed in paragraph 36, the government is taking steps to improve collections from non-paying customers.

AU revenue measures became effective on August 1, 1999, and the authorities have taken steps to improve collections and expedite the resolution of tax disputes. To date, the process of collecting on tax claims settled in courts has been hindered by the limited resources to carry out liquidations and inadequate bankruptcy procedures. The Ministry of Justice is addressing this problem and has requested technical assistance from the World Bank. The expenditure measures were approved as part of the amended 1999 budget enacted on August 28. While the authorities found it necessary to make substantial cuts in capital expenditures to close the fiscal gap, they protected the appropriations for the earthquake zone, which include the projects with greatest impact on the most vulnerable groups in Armenia. The revised program includes a number of measures leading to a tightening of expenditure control. (Paragraph 10 of the supplementary MEFP). 36. In addition, to minimize tinther quasi-jiscal expenditures pressures related to the nonpayment of energy consumption by the major budget supported users, the government will strengthen the management and financial monitoring of Nairit (a state-owned chemical plant), the drinking water and irrigation sectors, and the companies that provide district heating, and has endorsed their financial action plans for 1999-2000, including cash flows for the remainder of the year consistent with the financial support appropriated in the amended budget. 37. Local governments are expected to run balanced budgets in 1999, even though on current trends revenues are expected to be below budget levels. The authorities indicated that they are not concerned with the resulting cuts in budgeted expenditures, because the projected yearly increase in nominal local revenues would be sufficient to cover core expenditures (See paragraph 11 of the supplementary MEFP). 38. The State Fundfor Social Insurance is projected to run a balanced budget, despite the contribution collection problems experienced in the first half of 1999. To this end, the government is pressing state owned enterprises to settle their wage and associated pension contributions arrears, and the SFSI will intensify legal action against contribution debtors. Pension benefit arrears outstanding as of end-June 1999 will be eliminated before the end of the third quarter, aided in part by additional budgetary support. D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy 39. The revised monetaryprogram calls for a tightening of credit and strict enforcement of the policy of zero CBA net credit to the government on a quarterly basis. (See paragraph 15 of the supplementary MEFP). 40. To meet the indicative reserve and broad money targets, monetary control will need to be enhanced. The authorities noted, however, that on occasion the existing tools of monetary control have been insufficient to deal with the volatility of financial capital flows, workers’ remittances, and banks’ excess reserves. As a result, they had resorted to official Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - intervention to stabilize the exchange rate. The staff argued that additional flexibility in the exchange and interest rates, together with a tight rein on credit expansion and closer coordination of fiscal and monetary policies (see paragraph 42), should improve the effectiveness of monetary control. 41. There was a consensus, however, that in addition to establishing an indicative path for reserve money there was a need to limit the extent of the deviation from such path. Accordingly, the CBA will structure its monetary operations with a view to keeping the stock of reserve money close to the midpoint of a narrow quarterly corridor, the width of which reflects the historical intraquarter variability of excess reserves (see the supplement to the Technical Annex to the MEFP). If, at any point within the quarter, reserve money approaches a limit of the corridor, the CBA will promptly undertake corrective credit measures. Official intervention in the foreign exchange market may be allowed if reserve money is still within the corridor but credit measures are not sufficient to correct deviations. If reserve money is outside the corridor, the CBA will correct the deviations only by using credit measures or allowing the exchange rate to float. To ensure that interest rates on treasury bills are market determined, the government has since late August ceased the practice of rejecting bids when the total amount of bills offered has not been sold. 42. The success of the fiscal and monetary policy mix described above will depend on effectivepolicy coordination. Since end-July, the Ministry of Finance and the CBA have adopted a set of procedures which include provisions for the regular and timely exchange of information, analysis of the outcomes, and formulation of policy advice, particularly regarding the amount and maturity structure of the treasury bills to be offered in the primaty auctions. E. Banking Issues 43. Discussions on banking issues focused on the increase in the ratio of nonperforming loans, and the steps needed to reverse existing and avoid future cases of forbearance of prudential regulatory requirements. The authorities were aware of the rising trend in nonperforming loans, but stressed that it is not a systemic issue. They also pointed out that the increase in capital adequacy ratios and the reduction in the limits on open foreign positions, which entered into effect earlier this year, should improve the health of the banking system. In addition, it is expected that new loan-loss provisioning procedures, prepared in consultation with IMP experts, will be adopted soon. With the improvements in off-site supervision capacity, the CBA should be better able to judge banks’ soundness. Steps to develop the securities market will also be taken, including submitting to parliament a Law on Securities. 44. Regarding the three cases offorbearance, the authorities noted that the two banks which had breached the limits on lending to a single borrower are back in compliance with the regulations. The CBA has indicated, with the concurrence of the government, that if the third bank does not meet the standards by end-September 1999, they will initiate liquidation procedures. The staff expressed concern about the lack of arms-length relations between the government, the banks and the CBA as regulator. The authorities acknowledge the recent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - slippages, but view them as isolated events rather than a reversal in the quality and independence of banking supervision. In line with their commitment to full enforcement of the regulatory framework, the CBA has raised, effective August 9, the penalties to be applied in cases of non-compliance with reserve requirements, and will take additional steps to tighten non-compliance penalties for other prudential regulations. In the future there will be no exemptions granted from these penalties. F. Balance of Payments and External Debt 45. Discussions on the balance ofpayments projections for 1999 centered on the greater than expected impact of the Russian crisis on exports, private transfers and workers remittances, particularly in the early months of the year, as well as the related decline in nonresident participation in the treasury bill market and delays in foreign direct investment. The authorities believe that the appreciation of the real exchange rate has not contributed to the slowdown of exports in any significant way, although the competitive margin has been eroded in some sectors. Overall, the authorities are satisfied, and the staff concurs, that Armenia has weathered the worst part of the crisis without a major disruption in external payments. No restrictive trade practices have been used and, despite some calls for protection, the authorities have preserved a simple dual tariff structure and a low average tariff. In addition, efforts to conclude the procedures for WTO accession are entering the final stages. The staff concurs with the authorities’ view that the external environment has begun to improve, as evidenced by a modest recovery in exports and renewed interest on the part of both portfolio and foreign direct investors (there has been a modest increase in nonresident participation in the treasury bill market since March and in foreign direct investment since May). 46. The current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected at around 25 percent of GDP in 1999, compared with 22 percent in the original program, still 2% percentage points below 1998. Exports are expected to grow at 7 percent, slower than envisaged in the program, while imports are likely to contract somewhat instead of increasing as originally programmed. The capital account should improve in the second half of 1999, as privatization accelerates and foreign investment recovers, In addition, multilateral flows are expected to increase significantly, largely due to disbursements from the World Bank. Gross international reserves are targeted to reach US$309 million, as in the original program, equivalent to 3.7 months of next year’s imports. 47. Notwithstanding the expected improvements in the external sector, the authorities agree that the current level of external debt remains too large in relation to their fragile debt servicing capacity and vulnerability to external shocks. To this end, efforts to improve the debt and debt service profile will continue, and no new nonconcessional external borrowing or provision of external guarantees is expected to take place in 1999. The total stock of public and publicly guaranteed debt is predicted to reach about 48 percent of GDP at end-1999, compared to 43 percent in 1998. Since all additional external borrowing in 1999 will be concessional, the net present value of this debt should reach 3 1 percent of GDP in 1999, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - compared with 29 percent in 1998. In addition, steps to improve the management and monitoring of grants and external financing flows have been taken, which will help llfill the commitment to disseminate this information in a comprehensive and timely manner. There are also ongoing efforts to settle various disputes on external financial issues, mainly with Russia.22 Armenia maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. G. Structural Policies 48. The authorities agreed that it is important to restore the momentum ofptivotizurion. They argued that the apparent slowdown in the process was not due to lack of political will, but the contagion effect of the Russia crisis. They were encouraged to see renewed interest on the part of domestic and foreign investors in a number of sectors. The government intends to adhere to the privatization timetable agreed with the World Bank and adopted by parliament, and to continue to rely on market based mechanisms to value and allocate assets. The authorities were concerned about a group of selected enterprises, however, which did not sell in the first attempt, and have decided to strengthen the framework used in deciding the future of such enterprises, in consultation with the World Bank. The authorities gave assurances that these special procedures (to be applied to about 20 enterprises) will not slow the pace of privatization, and that they will enforce My the Privatization Law which mandates that any enterprise not sold after three attempts be promptly liquidated. Efforts will also be made to improve transparency in the privatization process by enhancing the reporting to parliament and the public on the outcomes of privatization as well as the use of such resources. 49. Discussions also addressed the issue of those enterprises ilrat remain under sfute ownership. While recognizing that some progress has been made, especially in the energy sector, the authorities agreed that additional efforts will need to be made to establish a comprehensive and timely reporting system in each of these enterprises, and that they should be run on the basis of commercial principles, so as to generate profits and increase their contribution to the budget. 50. Discussions on the financial rehabilitation of the enmgy sector were based on the findings of the review conducted by the World Bank in June 1999. The review disclosed that the gains stemming from the reduction in losses have been more than outweighed by the difficulties encountered in increasing cash collections and attaining the expenditure reduction targets. In addition, there have been significant delays in completing the domestic debt workout. As a result, the financing gap for the sector, before debt rescheduling, has been projected at about 5 percentage points of GDP in 1999. z For program purposes, amounts subject to dispute are not treated as external arrears.

Following extensive discussions with the staffs of the IMF and World Bank on aNert&ives lo close the 1999 energy se&r gap, the authorities have decided to rely on increases in budgetary support to the sector, stiffer penalties for nonpayment, and comprehensive domestic debt workouts, Based on these measures, the authorities revised the targets on collections and operations and maintenance expenditures in coordination with the Bank, and have agreed to defer the settlement of tax arrears outstanding as of January 1, 1999.23 In addition, the government has estimated that, if 85 percent of the debts and payables are rescheduled at 10 percent annual rate with no less than one year maturity, there will be no need for a tarSincrease in 1999. The authorities understand, however, that there is a considerable margin of error in the forecast of collections and expenditures, hence they have restated their intention to monitor closely the sectors’ cash flow and have indicated their readiness to reconsider their position on tariffs based on the outcome for the period January- August 1999. Understandings have also been reached with the staffs of the Fund and World Bank on a comprehensive set of measures for the energy sector to be implemented in the second half of 1999 as discussed in paragraph 20 of the supplementary MEFP. 52. The authorities acknowledged that civil service reform is essential. Issues that will be addressed next include the appropriate fimctions of the government in a transition economy and the streamlining of the number of employees. The authorities indicated that the most pressing problem in the civil service is the need to reform the pay scales and system of compensation (including establishing transparent merit-based systems for recruitment and promotion, while eliminating non-transparent and discretionary pay supplements). A new law on the civil service has been drafted and commented on by the World Bank. The staff emphasized the importance of moving decisively to improve the quality and pay of the civil service and to continue to implement the voluntary employment retrenchment program, keeping in mind that budgetary constraints call for further compression in the wage bill. V. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND CAPACITY TO REPAY THE FUNJJ 53. Medium term policy discussions touched upon the stance that would be required to consolidate and maintain macroeconomic stability, and the next stages of structural, institutional, and legal reform that would be needed to support high and sustainable growth. Discussions were based on a revision to the December 1998 medium-term scenario, which takes into account recent developments, including better-than-anticipated growth of economic activity and inflation in 1998, and a stronger-than-expected impact of the Russian crisis on the external sector (Figure 8 and Table 9). 54. Armenia’s potential GDP growth over the medium term is projected to converge to 7 percent, while annual inflation should decline from 6 percent in 2000 to 4 percent in 2004 While the revised projections do not incorporate gains that may arise from a permanent z Tax arrears increased by dram 3.7 billion in the first half of 1999.

Box 1. Implications of Peace Settlement in Nagorno-Karabakb For Armenia’s Medium -Term Prospects 1. Armenia’s population and economy has greatly sutXered t?om a IO-year conflict with Azerbaijan. Although a cease-tire has been in effect since May 1994, the two sides have not yet found a pcmvtnent peaceful solution. Recently, a series of meetings have taken place, includiig at the presi$cntial level, reflecting a renewed e&t to settle the conflict. 2. The peace dividend resulting from a resolution of the Nagomo-Karabakh contlict could significantly improve Armenia’s medium term growth prospects (as well as those of the other parties involved in the conflict), in at least four ways: l It would facilitate the process of regional integration. The integ&on of key infmstmctwe networks in transport, oil and gas would enhance the competitiveness of all countries in the region. Io addition, tbis could make unnecessary certain in6asbuctore investments currently planned by Armenia, whose sole purpose is to facilitate trade and transportation in the face of a blockade of traditional trade routes. . It would lead to an end of the blockade on soxnc trade markets and routes, reducing transport costs, enhancing prospects for sustained export growth, and inducing a siflcant reallocation of resources within the economy toward tradeables. According to the World Bank, elimination of die blockade would result in a one-time increase in the level of Armenia’s real expolts by 12 to 15 percent, and in real imports by 5 percent. . It would reduce uncertainty for investors by securing trade routes, eliminating the threat (however modest) of renewed military conflict, and easing regional tensions. This would improve prospects for total investment and FDI, and increase interest in long term fixed investments. . It would reduce direct costs associated with the conflict, including military expenditures and other national security related costs The resources saved could then be chaoneled into more productive areas, or reduce the government’s borrowing requirements. 3. The staEdiscusscd with the authorities the need to begin more formal analysis and quantification of the potential peace dividend. This will be evaluated in gcater detail as part of discussions on a successor arrangement. 55. Growth over the medium term is expected to be export oriented. Areas with the greatest export potential include labor-intensive light industry, agro-processing, financial services and high technology activities. The increase in investment required to support higher rates of GDP growth is expected to originate mostly in the private sector and be financed increasingly by domestic savings. 56. The macroeconomic stability needed to create an enabling environment for growth is expected to be achieved by keeping the growth of monetuv aggregates in line with the targeted growth in nominal income, in the context of market-determined interest and exchange Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33 - rates, and by continuing to reduce the overall fiscal de@ (including grants) from about 6 percent of GDP in 1999 to 2 percent of GDP in 2004 (Table 10). 57. To achieve the medium term fiscal targets will require efforts to ensure a sustained increase in revenues and continued expenditure restraint. Additional revenues could come from widening the tax base by eliminating remaining exemptions and strengthening tax administration further. The reduction and prioritisation of expenditures will be guided by the medium-term expenditure framework, expected to be in place by end-1999, while efficiency gains are likely to ensue from the implementation of the comprehensive civil service reform currently under development. The medium-term projections assume that a comprehensive strategy for the use of privatization proceeds will be in place by end-l 999. 58. The balance of payments projections show the current account deficit declining from 27 percent of GDP in 1998 (excluding grants) to 13 percent in 2004, mostly due to a narrowing of the external trade deficit (Table 11). Export receipts are expected to grow at an average annual rate of 12 percent, reflecting the benefits of privatisation and industrial restructuring, and the modemization associated with foreign direct investment, while imports are projected to grow slightly slower than real GDP, reflecting in part a broadening of import substitution. Imports related to humanitarian assistance are expected to decline with falling official transfers. Private transfers and workers remittances should contribute significantly to the improvement in the current account balance. Despite these improvements, sizable financial gaps are expected to prevail in the medium-term. 59. Armenia’s debt and debt service burden is expected to remain high over the medium term, and is particularly sensitive to the way in which the projected financing gaps are closed. If the projected gaps are closed by debt, external debt would increase from 44 percent of GDP at end- 1998 to 56 percent of GDP in 2002 (Figure 9). These ratios are quite high by international standards, even if account is taken of the degree of concessionality of Armenia’s debt.Z4 The debt service implications would be equally burdensome. In particular, debt service in terms of exports of goods and non-factor services is expected to rise From 13 percent in 1998 to 18 percent in 2004, with a peak debt service of 21 percent in 2000.” To avoid these high debt and debt service burdens, the staff strongly recommended that the external financing gaps not be closed by debt accumulation, but rather by taking steps to increase domestic savings further (including by fiscal restraint), attracting additional nondebt creating flows, 24 The net present value of public and publicly guaranteed debt-which, based only on debt agreements signed or under discussion, is projected to increase from 29 percent of GDP at end-1998 to more than 32 percent GDP by 2000-would reach 43 percent of GDP in 2004 *’ Debt service obligations relative to fiscal revenues (including grants) are projected to increase from 10 percent in 1998 to over 15 percent in 2000, decline to around 12 percent in 2001-2003, and rise again to 14 percent by 2004.

The medium-term projections assume a deepening of structural, legal and institutional reforms, aimed at reducing inefficiencies and establishing clear rules for the operation of a market economy. In particular, it is expected that (i) the current privatization program, including the energy sector, will be completed in 2000; 26 (ii) there will be a consistent and uniform enforcement of strict prudential requirements; (ii) efforts to develop capital markets, including the legal and regulatory environment for securities, corporate governance, shareholders’ rights, and financial reporting and auditing, will continue; (iv) there will be a strengthening of the institutional capacity to deal with bankruptcy cases and the liquidation of confiscated assets; and (v) the strategy to address the financial problems of the energy sector and of the major consumers of energy will have been fully implemented. 61. Assuming that the full amount of the ESAF arrangement is disbursed, the Fund’s exposure to Armenia would increase from 10 percent of GDP at end-1998 to 10% percent at end-1999 (Tables 12 and 13). Liabilities to the Fund by end-1999 would account for 22 of Armenia’s total external debt and, given the high ratio of debt to GDP, this will require close attention by the staff. Nevertheless, to date Armenia has serviced its payments obligations in a timely manner and, in light of the authorities’ commitment to continued macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform, and the projected increase in the level of official international reserves, Armenia should be able to meet its obligations to the Fund. VI. STAFFAPPRAISAL 62. Since August 1998, the Armenian stabiization and reform efforthas been subjected to serious tests. In addition to a more severe than anticipated impact from the Russian crisis, Armenia has endured a drought as well as political uncertainty in the run up to the May 30, 1999 parliamentary elections. Despite this, its overall macroeconomic performance was among the best in the CIS: real GDP growth continued to be strong (albeit lower than in 1998) and inflation remained low (although it has risen moderately). However, the authorities’ response to the difficulties departed, in both letter and spirit, from the strategy supported by ESAF III. In particular, there was excessive intervention in the foreign exchange market and attempts to control the interest rate in the securities market; widespread fiscal indiscipline as evidenced by sizable accumulation of tax, budgetary expenditure and pension arrears; government interference with the workings and the enforcement of prudential supervision of the banking system; and a revival of noncash operations to settle overdue energy payments. % is assumed that those few enterprises that will remain government owned will be subject to hard-budget constraints, and be operated on commercial principles. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-36- 63. The new authorities have embarked on immediate corrective actions, and the main objectives of the ESAF-supported program are still within reach. They are determined to implement a policy mix which calls for a sustained tightening of financial policies and reliance on market forces to determine the exchange and interest rates. They also have undertaken to instill a renewed impetus to structural reform. 64. The new government’s decision to undertake a strong package of fiscal and quasi- fiscal corrective measures, shortly after being appointed, is very commendable. The authorities must forcefully address the issue of tax arrears, and take steps to ensure that authorized expenditures are appropriately funded. Reliance on advance or negotiated tax payments, and the incurrence of expenditure arrears, should be avoided as they promote tax evasion and conuption. The plans to reverse the weakening of revenues, enhance expenditure control, improve the management of public debt, and strengthen tax administration and treasury management must be implemented fully and without delay. The staff encourages the authorities to finalize the medium-term expenditure framework, seek parliamentary approval of the civil service law, improve the flow of information on the activities of local governments, and monitor more closely the operations of the SFSI. Pension benefits arrears should be cleared as soon as possible and the collection of overdue pension contributions expedited. 65. The revised monetary program should help keep inflation under control. The staff welcomes the commitment to tighten domestic credit control, and to use an indicative path for reserve money to guide the day-to-day implementation of the monetary program. Efforts to enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies must continue. The achievement of the monetary targets will depend on enforcing the quarterly zero limit on the extension of CBA net credit to the government, while allowing the exchange and interest rates to reflect underlying market pressures. 66. The tightening of regulations to reduce banks’ exposure to exchange rate risks and strengthen their capital bases is a positive step. However, the deterioration in key prudential indicators of the banking system, albeit moderate, is a warning signal that must not be disregarded. It is worrisome that there have been cases of forbearance of prudential regulatory requirements, involving transactions endorsed by the government coupled with exemptions from penalties by the CBA. The staffwelcomes the authorities’ commitment to reapply regulatory standards in these cases and to prevent recurrence of such forebearance. The staff encourages the authorities to intensify their efforts to improve off-site supervision, and to move swiftly in adopting new loan-loss provisioning requirements. 67. The progress in reducing the burden of external debt and debt service is welcome. A cautious approach to external borrowing must be pursued. The authorities should complete development of a comprehensive external debt strategy for the medium term, including provisions for canceling the undisbursed portion of loans which were contracted without due diligence or on inappropriate terms, and for restructuring nonconcessional loans. The staff supports the authorities’ intention to use privatization proceeds to improve the country’s debt and debt service profile. The authorities should resolve all remaining unsettled external Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-37- financing disputes. They deserve praise for maintaining a liberal trade and exchange system amidst the recent difficulties, and for their resolute pursuit of WTO membership. 68. The authorities’ commitment to restore the momentum of privatization is encouraging and should be facilitated by the apparent renewed interest of foreign investors. Adherence to the original schedule of privatization through 2000 will be important. The government should take steps to assure investors that the rules set out in the privatization law prevail, and to enhance the transparency of the process, including through broader dissemination of the outcome of the transactions. The staffwelcomes efforts to set up a financial monitoring scheme for publicly owned enterprises, 69. Setbacks in the implementation of the financial rehabilitation of the energy sector pose severe dangers to macroeconomic stabilization and should be addressed forcefilly. While the staff commends the authorities for the progress in reducing losses, it regrets that there has been another round of noncash operations, a further accumulation of expenditure arrears including on tax payments, and delays in restructuring overdue domestic debts. To break the prevailing culture of nonpayment and enhance governance, the government must enforce cash payments for energy consumption (with sanctions for nonpayers), timely payment of the sector’s expenditures, and an orderly and market based resolution of overdue domestic debts. Anything less will lead to pressures for further budgetary support to the sector, or to higher tariffs for consumers who pay their bills. Since important delinquent energy consumers are budget-supported organizations, the decision to tackle this quasi-fiscal problem through the budget is understandable. However, this support needs to be conditional on the presentation of action plans that will rebuild the capacity of these organizations to pay out of their own resources for their future energy consumption. Looking ahead, timely implementation of the medium-term measures specified in consultation with the Fund and the Bank is crucial, and the government should proceed with the plans to privatize the distribution cqmpanies in 2000. 70. The authorities’ medium-term strategy to pursue high and sustained growth through an export oriented strategy, with competitive markets guiding the allocation of resources to activities driven by private sector initiative, is appropriate. The authorities understand that the success of this strategy depends on consolidating and sustaining economic stability, and proceeding decisively with the next stage of structural, legal and institutional reforms. Their determination to promote domestic savings-especially in light of the expected decline in oficial transfers-to strengthen forther the official international reserve position, and to improve the management of external debt is encouraging. The authorities must ensure that the projected balance of payments gaps be closed either by a further rise in domestic savings or by additional non-debt creating flows. The authorities’ interest in developing an analytic framework to gauge the “peace dividend” from a permanent resolution of the Nagorno- Kharabagh issue is welcome and the staff stands ready to assist in this analysis. 71. The staff welcomes the progress achieved in implementing the standards of the GDDS. The authorities are encouraged to continue efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of information on national accounts, as well as on the finances of local governments and major Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - public enterprises. Equally important are efforts to broaden the dissemination of information, in particular concerning grants and their monetization, and external public and publicly guaranteed debt, including loans in kind. 72. The authorities have taken steps to ensure that key agencies are Y2K compliant. The statfrecommends that adequate reserves be set aside in the 2000 budget to provide support, particularly to the h4inistry of Statistics and the Y2K Commission, in case it is needed. 73. Armenia is likely to continue to require extensive technical assistance for the next few years. The Fund will continue to provide appropriate technical assistance, and will coordinate with other providers to ensure maximum efficiency. 74. In light of the breadth and extent of corrective measures, including prior actions, undertaken to bring the program back on track, the renewed commitment to preserve and consolidate macroeconomic stability and deepen structural reform, the staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers for nonobservance of performance criteria and completion of the mid-term review under the third annual ESAF arrangement. 75.

World Bank The Republic of Armenia joined the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) in September 1992. Bank lending to Armenia is designed to help the government accelerate the transition to a market economy and alleviate the large pockets of poverty that have emerged in the last few years. In the area of structural reforms, the Bank has placed emphasis on the promotion of private sector development, on more effective social protection, and improved services in health and education. The Bank is working with the government to develop Armenia’s exports and to rehabilitate the country’s infrastructure, as well as to reduce poverty through cost-effective delivery of basic social services, especially for the poor. The Bank’s portfolio in Armenia has increased rapidly. Since 1995 the World Bank has approved four adjustment credits and three technical assistance projects in support of Armenia’s economic reform program (the most recent-Structural Adjustment Credit IU- was approved in December 1998 for SDR46.2 million, approximately US$65 million). Investment lending has included IDA credits to support infrastructure rehabilitation including for earthquake reconstruction, irrigation, power, road maintenance, and municipal water. Other IDA credits have included operations in health, education, a social investment fbnd, private investment, banking reform, and private enterprise development. In fiscal year 1999 an Agriculture Reform Support credit of US%12 million was approved, followed by a US$8 million Title Registration project. In March 1999, an IDA credit of US%21 million was approved in support of electricity transmission and distribution, including support for privatization. Most recently, in June 1999 a US%26 million Dam Safety credit was approved. Total IBRDiIDA commitments to Armenia as ofJuly 31, 1999 were US.%607 million for 20 operations. 2. European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) The EBRD has been actively involved with Armenia. As of the end of March 1999, the EBRD had signed three public sector sovereign guaranteed projects. In addition, EBRD is considering the possibility of investing in equity and providing financing to the privatized Armentel for the expansion and modemization of the national telecommunications network in Armenia. The equity investment would represent approximately 10 percent of the company’s capital. In March 1993 the EBRD approved a ECU 52.4 million loan for construction on the Hrazdan thermal power plant, aimed at the eventual closure of Armenia’s nuclear plant in Medzamor. The government is contemplating the privatization of Hrazdan as the completion of this Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - plant, which has been estimated recently to cost a further US%120 million, is constrained by limited budgetary resources. The EBRD has arranged technical assistance funding for the Hrazdan privatization prospectus and continues to advise on the privatization process. In November 1994, an ECU 18.9 million loan to build an air cargo terminal at Zvartnots Airport was signed. A Wholesale Food Market Project loan was agreed in early 1996 for ECU 13 million, including ECU 3 million as a line of credit for on-lending to food producers. However, the project encountered serious difficulties, which slowed down implementation, with disbursements amounting to under ECU 1 million by mid-1998. The EBRD and the government agreed to cancel the outstanding amount of the loan and to re-consider the project once a temporary market operates at full capacity.

Since September 1997, an Armenia country page has been added to the IFS. However, further improvement is needed in the real and external sectors areas in order to enhance the design and monitoring of economic policies. Table 1 shows the availability of core statistical data, and the authorities’ publication policy. National accounts and price statistics The Ministry of Statistics has made significant changes to the national accounts methodology to bring it more in line with international practices. Good progress has been made in developing estimates of quarterly GDP at 1996 prices, which will soon be published. Basic data collection procedures have also been improved, with national accounts adopting the concept of gross value based on accrued sales valued at transaction prices. However, progress has been slow in collecting data by discrete time periods and national accounts data at constant prices are still derived by comparable prices instead of the producer price index, which suffers from inadequate coverage. With STA assistance, the consumer price index program is in place and CPI data are current. With respect to wage data, coverage is limited to the public sector. Fiscal statistics Fiscal data have problems with respect to both timeliness and quality. Revenue and cash expenditure data for the republican budget are available on a daily basis, with a lag of one to two days. However, data on expenditures on a commitment basis are currently only available with a lag of more than one month, making it difficult to monitor the accumulation of budgetary arrears. The treasury is in the process of implementing measures designed to improve this situation. Expenditures are reported in line with GFS standards. There remain significant shortcomings in the timeliness and quality of data on the transactions of local governments and the State Fund for Social Insurance. Money and banking statistics Money and banking statistics are provided on a timely basis, Data on CBA accounts are available on daily, with a one day lag, while the monetary survey is provided weekly with a one week lag. The CBA provides monetary statistics dealing with exchange rates and interest rates with a very short lag. A new chart of accounts, relying on the IAS, was introduced in January 1998 and since then the detailed balance sheets of the Monetary Authority and of the Deposit Money Banks follow IAS methodology. Some improvement is needed in the area of interest rates, in order to decompose data on commercial operations from data on special operations done at a non-commercial interest rates.

Accordingly, the government’s program, whose general principles were presented to parliament on June 18, 1999, aims at creating the conditions for high and sustained growth in the medium term. The program thus seeks to ensure price stability, enhance Armenia’s external competitiveness, deepen the restructuring of the energy and financial sectors, reform the education and health systems, and accelerate the privatization process. The adverse external conditions which we have experienced since August 1998 had a more serious impact on our economy in 1999 than was originally expected. The negative effects of this external shock were heightened by a prevailing climate of political uncertainty associated with the parliamentary elections. Against this background, it became increasingly difficult to frilly implement the policies envisaged in the program, and as a result significant deviations from program targets emerged. Finding an adequate response to the difficulties faced was a long and protracted process, and thus it has taken more time than expected to complete the discussions for the mid-term review of the third annual ESAF program. In the accompanying Supplement to the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies agreed in December 1998, we describe the modifications to our economic program for the remainder of 1999. The revised program assumes that the main 1999 annual targets contained in the program presented to the IMF Executive Board are still broadly within reach. The cornerstone of our program is the revision to the State budget which was approved by parliament on August 28, 1999. Prior to approval of the amended budget, the conduct of public finance was guided by three decrees that contained revenue-increasing measures and one that froze expenditure authorisations to a level consistent with the amended budget. This fiscal effort will be supported by continued pursuit of a tight credit policy in the context of a flexible exchange rate. In addition, we have started to implement a number of measures aimed at accelerating the process of restoring the financial viability of the energy sector, and we will intensify the financial monitoring of enterprises in the public sector so as to harden their budget constraints and reduce the quasi-fiscal expenditures associated with the operation of such enterprises. The attached document also elaborates on the steps we are taking to strengthen banking supervision and to provide renewed impetus to our privatization program. If necessary, we are prepared to take further measures to ensure the success of our program, after consulting with the Fund.

We also request the completion of the mid-term review, and the last disbursement under the third annual ESAF arrangement. Sincerely yours, Id Levon Barkhoudarian Minister Ministry of Finance ISI Vazgen Sarkissian Prime Minister Republic of Armenia Is/ Tigran Sargsian Chairman Central Bank of Armenia Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-61 - REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA SUPPLEMENT TO THE MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 1998/1999 1. A combination of external factors beyond our control, as well as some regrettable slippages in policy implementation, caused our economic reforms to go somewhat off track in the first half of 1999. Below we describe the steps the Armenian government and the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) intend to take-and in many cases, have already taken-to correct these slippages and ensure that our program targets are achieved. 2. These commitments are in addition to those in our original Memorandum ofEconomic and Financial Policies (MEFP), dated December 8, 1998. The government remains determined to implement the policies in the original memorandum, which remain valid unless they are superceded by new commitments described below. In particular, during the program period, neither the government nor the central bank will impose or intensify any exchange restrictions, introduce or modify any multiple currency practices, conclude any bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII, or impose or intensify any import restrictions for balance of payments purposes. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS lN THE FIRST HALF OF 1999 3. Economic developments in Armenia have been dominated by the Russian crisis, which has had a larger impact on our economy than had been envisioned at the time of the IMF Board discussion of the third annual ESAF program. Industrial production, output in the transport and services sectors, exports, and workers remittances and transfers have all been adversely affected by the Russian crisis. In addition, non-residents’ demand for Armenian government treasury bills has declined, and foreign investment inflows have slowed considerably. Had it not been for the strong performance in the construction sector in the first part of 1999, real GDP growth in 1999 would be weaker than programmed. 4. We recognize, however, that the difficulties encountered have not been entirely due to factors beyond our control. In our effort to contain the damage from the Russian crisis, we tried to maintain the level of aggregate demand by keeping public expenditure commitments unchanged, without regard to weakening tax revenue developments. This led to a substantial accumulation of expenditure arrears. Moreover, we took steps to avoid large movements in nominal exchange and interest rates, resorting to sizable official intervention in the foreign exchange market and setting low cutoff rates in treasury bill auctions. As a result of these developments and policies, the state budget revenue and net international reserves targets for end-March 1999 were missed, and the continuous performance criterion on non- accumulation of budgetary arrears was not observed. Dram broad money and reserve money were consistently well below the indicative program targets, reflecting a flight to foreign currency’denominated assets (Table 1). The raal exchange rate appreciated and real interest Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - rates continued rising, contributing to a fiuther deterioration of the overall fiscal position. We also faced difficulties in implementing critical aspects of the energy sector reform strategy (most notably, there was slow progress in improving collections); privatization slowed considerably, as evidenced by a rising share of firms not sold in the first attempt and a noticeable slowdown in the implementation of the privatization program through international tenders; and there was an increase in the number of commercial banks failing to observe prudential requirements, mostly due to growing non-performing loans to public enterprises. REVISIONS TO THE ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK FOR THE REMAINDER OF 1999 Program Objectives 5. The package of measures described below has been designed to sharply reduce the macroeconomic imbalances that originated in the first half of 1999; strengthen budgetary discipline of state-owned enterprises and key sectors receiving budgetary support, while taking steps to end the culture of non-payment; improve the coordination of fiscal and monetary policies; and provide a renewed impetus to structural reforms in key areas. Given the need to bring the program back on track as quickly as possible, a number of policy measures, detailed in Table 2, have been or will have been implemented prior to the IMF Executive Board’s consideration of our request for a completion of the mid-term review under the third annual ESAF arrangement. Despite the short period since the inception of the revised program, there are already signs of improvement, reflected in some recovery in revenues, greater control in expenditures, a reduction in the stock of expenditure arrears, and rising billing collections in the energy sector. 6. The revised program is consistent with achieving real GDP growth in 1999 of about 4 percent, close to the original program target, while containing inflation to no more than 8 percent during the year, down from the program target of 10 percent. The revised quantitative targets for the remainder of 1999 are presented in Table 1, and remain as defined in EBS/98/213 and EBS/98/213 Supplement 1, except where modified in the attached Supplement to the Technical Annex to the h4EFP. In addition, structural benchmarks have been set for end-September 1999 (Table 3). Fiscal Policy 7. Our general fiscal strategy calls for limiting the state and republican budget deficit to about 6 percent of GDP in 1999, unchanged from the original program. Given weakening revenues and higher fiscal and quasi-fiscal expenditure needs in some areas, deficit target, in the absence of corrective measures, would have been exceeded by about dram 37% billion, or 3% percent of GDP.’ To ensure the achievement of our deficit target, the government i This excess is due to (i) dram 13.9 billion in shortfalls in tax revenue and financing, partly compensated for by higher profit transfers from the CBA, and (ii) dram 23.9 billion in unbudgeted fiscal and quasi-fiscal expenditures, mainly in the form of additional budget Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - introduced on August 1, 1999 several revenue-increasing measures (as described in paragraph 8) and took an administrative decision to freeze expenditures at a level consistent with the revised annual targets on August 17, 1999. Subsequently, the government submitted amendments to the 1999 Budget Law to an extraordinary session of Parliament on August 23, 1999, which were approved on August 28, 1999. The amended budget leaves roughly unchanged the nominal level of expenditures approved in the 1999 Budget Law, while reducing some current and capital appropriations to make room for quasi-fiscal expenditures related to the energy sector and other extraordinary expenses. The plan also allows for clearing, during the third quarter of 1999, all budget and pension arrears outstanding as of July 1, 1999.’ The government is committed to take steps to ensure that no new expenditure arrears will be accumulated during the remainder of the year. 8. In closing the fiscal gap identified above, the government has implemented revenue measures with an expected yield of dram 12.5 billion, or about 1% percent of GDP. The government decree that became effective August 1, 1999, provided for (i) an increase in the excise tax per 1,000 imported, domestic filtered, and domestic non-filtered cigarettes, from their current levels of $4.3, dram 1,900, and dram 800, respectively, to $15, $12 and dram 1,100; and (ii) an increase in the hazardous materials duty on gasoline from 2 percent to 44 percent. In addition, the new Ministry of State Revenues has started implementing a series of tax administration measures, specified in consultation with the Ih@ staff, which will increase revenues in the last half of 1999 by at least dram 800 million (about 0.1 percent of GDP). 9. The amended 1999 budget includes cuts in expenditures previously approved in the original 1999 budget, amounting to about dram 25 billion (2% percent of GDP, or almost 10 percent of the expenditures in the original budget law). These cuts imply that for the second half of 1999 most domestically financed capital projects will be suspended, and unexecuted budgeted current expenditures will be reduced by about 8% percent. 10. To ensure the sustainability of the fiscal effort, the government intends to tighten expenditure control considerably. To this end, a new monthly reporting framework for payments is being implemented and the 2000 budget is being prepared based on a recently adopted unified chart of accounts. Steps are also being taken to increase the pace of automation of the treasury and continue its organizational restructuring, including by support to pay for the consumption of certain budgetary organizations and strategic energy consumers (including the irrigation, drinking water, and district heat sectors, and the state- owned enterprise Nairit), higher than projected total interest payments and transfers to the State Fund for Social Insurance, and budgetary lending to cover the unfunded working capital requirements of the energy sector. ‘The program definition of budgetary expenditure and pension arrears, as well as the reporting requirements, are presented in the accompanying Supplement to the Technical Annex to the MEFP. .

Zero-balance accounts will become effective in December, 1999, and all residual republican and local government accounts in commercial banks will be closed by December 3 1, 1999, except for one zero-balance account for each local field treasury in an agency bank. The number of extrabudgetary accounts will also be reduced from 358 at the end of July to 100 by year end. 11. Local governments will need to address the deterioration in their financial position without additional budget support. On current trends, local revenues in 1999 will be about 35 percent below their budgeted levels (although they will be 15 percent above the level of 1998). Since the government will not provide transfers or budgetary loans, beyond what was provided for in the 1999 budget, and the law prohibiting borrowing by local governments will continue to be enforced, the revenue shortfall of the local governments will have to be met by an equal cut in expenditures. 12. The Government is committed to address the problem confronting the State Fund for Social Insurance (SFSI) due to low collections in the first half of 1999, associated with rising wage arrears in state-owned enterprises. As a result of these low collections, about dram 3% billion in pension arrears were accumulated in the first half of the year. The government has instructed the SFSI to repay all outstanding pension arrears during the third quarter of 1999. To ensure that this decision is implemented, the government has taken administrative measures to ensure prompt payment of wage arrears and associated pension contributions by state-owned enterprises, and will proceed forcelidly in liquidating confiscated property and initiating bankruptcy proceedings of debtors, as appropriate. The SFSI expects that these measures will be sufficient to allow the repayment of all pension arrears. However, as a precautionary step, and to meet the deadline for clearing pension arrears by end-September 1999, budgetary support to the SFSI have been raised by dram 1.8 billion, to be released as needed during the third quarter of this year. Quasi-Fiscal Issues 13. Since a large part of the fiscal gap for 1999 was due to the emergence of unbudgeted expenditures related to the consumption of energy by a major chemical plant (Nairit), the drinking water and irrigation sectors, and district heating, the government has decided to take steps to reduce (and eventually eliminate) the budgeting inadequacy of these sectors, As a first step, the cabinet issued instructions on July 29 assigning responsibilities for the design, management, implementation, and monitoring of financial plans for each of these sectors. In addition, on August 3 1, the government submitted to the IMF and the World Bank preliminary action plans for each of these sectors. These action plans include cash flows for the period 1999-2000, and identify potential financial gaps and possible sources of financing to close them. The government is committed to not using any form of noncash operations or new expenditure arrears in closing the identified gaps. The action plans also include short- term measures to deal with any problems encountered. Quarterly reporting of actual cash flows for each of these sectors, to the Ministry of Finance and the IMF, have already started.

The government and the CBA will endeavor to enhance the coordination of fiscal and monetary policy. To this end, on July 20, 1999, the Ministry of Finance and the CBA formalized procedures for coordinating and monitoring the weekly execution of the budget and the liquidity program of the CBA, and providing input for the decision on the amount and maturity structure of the Treasury bills to be issued in the primary auctions. Provisions have also been made to ensure a timely exchange of fiscal and monetary information and projections between the CBA and the MOF. Monetary and Exchange Bate Policy 15. Consistent with the lower inflation target for 1999 and to achieve the NIR target, the revised monetary program for the second half of 1999 calls for an expansion in net domestic assets of the CBA by about 4 percent of reserve money at the end of June 1999, somewhat lower than in the original program. This expansion of credit would imply reserve money growth of about 19 percent in the last half of the year which, combined with a moderate decline in the multiplier-as commercial banks increase demand for reserves to meet prudential regulatory requirements-would accommodate an expansion of dram broad money of 15 percent, somewhat higher than in the original program. The CBA will not extend any direct credit to the government on a quarterly basis. CBA intra-quarter net lending to the government, if any, will be done by acquiring treasury bills in the secondary market. The stock of CBA net credit will not be allowed to exceed the end-quarter target by more than 10 percent of the projected cumulative monthly revenues within the quarter, at any point during the quarter. 16. While the CBA will continue to target credit as the main instrument of monetary control, day to day monetary operations will be guided by an indicative corridor for reserve money, as defined in the Supplement to the Technical Annex of the MEFP. If at any point reserve money reaches the upper or lower limit of the corridor, the CBA will undertake corrective measures. 17. The revised monetary program will be implemented in the context of greater exchange rate and interest rate flexibility than has been observed in the recent past, In particular, the CBA will allow for increased flexibility in the exchange rate, with net intervention limited to the level necessary for the achievement of the NIR floor and keeping reserve money on target and within the boundaries of the corridor specified in the program. In addition, interest rates on treasury bills will be fully market determined; the practice temporarily adopted in early 1999 of rejecting bids on treasury bills when the total amount of bills offered has not been sold, has been stopped. External Debt Issues 18. The adverse external developments have weakened the export and private transfers outlook for 1999 and heightened Armenia’s dependence on foreign savings. Against this background, the government will intensify its efforts to strengthen the management and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-66- monitoring of external grants and the contracting of public and publicly guaranteed loans. As a first step, a decision has been made not to contract any new nonconcessional external borrowing or to provide external guarantees for the remainder of 1999. We have also created a unit in the Ministry of Finance responsible for coordinating the negotiation, contracting and monitoring of all external grants and public and publicly guaranteed loans. Looking ahead, we will endeavor to develop and start to implement, by end-September 1999, a comprehensive external borrowing strategy, in consultation with IMP staff, which will guide all future contracting of government loans or extension of sovereign guarantees. The government will also undertake all necessary efforts, with the government of Russia, to settle the unresolved external financial issues regarding mutual arrears between Armenian and Russian companies, disbursements under the 1997 and 1998 interstate agreements on the provision of loans to Armenia, and any other unsettled financial obligations. Structural Policies 19. To avoid the recurrence ofproblems encountered in 1998 and 1999 with regard to the forbearance of prudential regulatory requirements for some commercial banks, the CBA has decided, effective August 9, 1999, to raise penalties applicable to noncompliance cases, and will refrain from extending any exemptions from these penalties in the future. The CBA will enforce the existing plans agreed with the commercial banks which had violated the prudential requirements, and will exercise its right to initiate liquidation procedures against those banks which fail to meet the targets specified in the agreed plans. The government and the CBA will also implement, before end-year, new loan-loss provisioning procedures, prepared in consultation with the IMF staff, including allowing for the tax deductibility of such provisions beginning in the 2000 budget. During the remainder of 1999, the government and the CBA will also take steps to develop the legal and institutional framework for the securities market and seek the adoption by parliament of a Law on Securities Market. 20. Despite recent improvements, the energy sector will face in 1999 a financing gap, before debt rescheduling, of about dram 5 1 billion (or about 5 percent of GDP). To close this gap the government will continue its efforts to reduce losses and improve collections and generation efftciency, and will rely on (i) additional budgetary appropriations, as discussed in paragraph 7; (ii) suspension of services to budgetary organizations which attempt to consume electricity beyond approved levels, (iii) suspension of service to customers with payments arrears; and (iv) comprehensive domestic debt workouts. Given the results of the recently concluded domestic debt restructuring exercise, there will be no need for a tariff increase in 1999. However, the government remains committed to take any additional measures that’ may be necessary to avoid the reemergence of a financial gap in the remainder of 1999, including to improve collections and reduce operational expenditures further. If unavoidable, we will consider imposing a temporary surcharge on the existing tariff structure, pending a comprehensive review of the adequacy of the existing tariffs. The government has also contracted a consulting firm to prepare, by October 15, 1999, a 3-year maintenance plan and annual maintenance budget for the power sector enterprises, and to update the government’s least cost power investment plan, including financing proposals. The 3-year maintenance Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 67 - plan and annual budget will not be financed using government contracted or guaranteed nonconcessional debts. The government will also seek to adopt IAS-based accounting and auditing procedures for key companies in the energy sector, in line with the agreements with the World Bank. 21. The government is determined to restore the momentum of privatization and ensure an appropriate use of privatization proceeds. To this end, steps will be taken to preserve the market valuation of all privatized assets, and to privatize enterprises in accordance with the timetable agreed with the World Bank and adopted by parliament. The government has partially modified the privatization strategy in order to expedite the sale of selected enterprises which do not sell in the first attempt. Instead of waiting 30 days for offering for sale any enterprise that failed to sell in the first attempt, decisions will be made in a limited number of cases (identified in consultation with the World Bank) to (i) promptly offer them for sale a second time, (ii) restructure the enterprise to increase its sales prospects before offering it for sale a second time, or (iii) immediately proceed with the enterprise’s liquidation. These new procedures will not be allowed to slow the pace of privatization. As in the past, all enterprises in the privatization program which are not sold after three attempts will be liquidated. The government intends to broaden the scope and frequency of reports on each privatization transaction to both parliament and the public at large. The medium term strategy for the use of privatization proceeds, which is being prepared in consultation with the IMF and the World Bank, will be approved by end-1999. 22. The government intends to broaden the number of enterprises which remain under public ownership that are subject to financial monitoring, and the scope of the such monitoring Preliminary cash flow outcomes for the period January-June 1999 of the 12 largest enterprises subject to monitoring have already been made public, and the number of enterprises to be monitored will be increased to at least 17 by end-September 1999. The initial cash flow reporting of the additional enterprises will start in October, 1999. Consultations 23. We believe that the policies and measures set forth above, combined with those in the original memorandum, are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but we will take any tirther measures that may be necessary for this purpose. We will remain in close consultation with the IMP. During the remainder of the program period, we will consult with the Managing Director on the adoption of any measures that may be appropriate, at our initiative or whenever the Managing Director requests a consultation. Moreover, after the period of the program and while the Republic of Armenia has outstanding financial obligations to the Fund arising from loans under the third annual arrangement, we will consult with the Fund from time to time, at our initiative or whenever the Managing Director requests consultation on the Republic of Armenia’s economic and financial policies.

I. NET INTERNATIONAL RESERVES 1. The definition of gross reserve assets has been modified to clarify that such assets must be owned by the CBA highly liquid (less than one year in maturity), and without any attachments. RESERVE MONEY CORRIDOR 2. The indicative target for reserve money will be subject to a monthly corridor, consisting of upper and lower limits on the reserve money path. The width of the corridor, for each of the remaining quarters in 1999, has been determined based on the average standard deviation of excess reserves held by banks in each quarter during the period .1996-1998, estimated as follows: Standard Deviation of Excess Reserves 3. Thus, the corridor for the third quarter of 1999 allows for deviations of reserve money from the program path of up to 2.65 percent, Whenever reserve money approaches either limit of the corridor, the CBA will adopt corrective measures.

EXPENDITUREARREARSOFTHEREPUBLICANBUDGETANDTHESTATEFUM)FORSOCIAL INSURANCE (SFSI) 5. The previous floors on core expenditures have been replaced with a continuous requirement that the government incur no new arrears on any expenditure of the republican budget or the SFSI after June 30, 1999. In addition, all arrears outstanding as of June 30, 1999 must be cleared by September 30, 1999. With respect to wages, pension payments, family allowances, all other transfers, and interest payments, expenditure arrears occur if claims are not paid by the end of the month in which these payments were due. For all other expenditure categories, arrears are defined as the stock of unpaid verified claims outstanding more than 30 days. Expenditure arrears of the republican budget and the SFSI will be monitored on a monthly basis according to the classification indicated in Table Al. 6. The government is committed to ensure tbll enforcement ofthe regular reporting requirements agreed in the prbgram, as specified in Table AZ. 7. The information on budgetary and pension arrears will be reported to the Fund no later than the 15” (or the following working day in case of a weekend or holiday) of the subsequent month for wages, pension payments, family allowances, other transfers and interest payments, and no later than 45 days (or the following work day) for all other expenditures. 8. The information on the restructuring of the energy sector debt and payables was reported on September 10, 1999, and will be summarized according to Table A3. Any future restructuring agreement will be reported according to this format, including the accompanying signed document. In addition, the Ministry ofEnergy will provide the Resident Representative a copy of all signed restructuring agreements.
