INTRODUCTION 1. Situated in the western Pacific, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is comprised of four states with a total population of about 120,000. The economy is dependent on United States (U.S.) financing provided through the economic provisions of the Compact of Free Association (the Compact) (Box 1). Economic activity is dominated by the public sector, and the private sector has developed largely to meet the demands of the government and its workers. Small contributions also come fi-om agriculture, fisheries, and tourism. The U.S. dollar is used as the domestic currency in the FSM. 2. Over the past decade, economic growth has averaged 2 percent per annum, but a high population growth rate has meant that per capita incomes have stagnated at $1,928. Growth has varied considerably among the four states, averaging RedCDPGrowtb 3 percent per annum in Pohnpei, but ,0 having been flat in Chuuk. The FSM , ranks quite poorly among Pacific island (, economies according to the UNDP Human Poverty Index, in part because ’ of the income inequalities among the states (per capita GDP ranges from $3,139 in Yap to only $1,011 in Chuuk) -I and between urban areas and the outer islands within states. 3. In line with the Compact agreement, two stepdowns in U.S. funding have already taken place. Domestic adjustment was postponed following the first stepdown in I99 1 by recourse to external Rternd Debt commercial borrowing, which was secured against future Compact financing.’ However, following the m second stepdown in 1996, and faced 6. with the debt service burden on existing borrowing, significant domestic adjustment was required. With an independent exchange rate policy precluded by the use of the U.S. dollar, fiscal policy has borne the burden of this adjustment. Under an AsDB- assisted Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP), government expenditure has been reduced ’ The external debt burden in the FSM, however, remained much lower than in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Rh4I) (peaking at 70 percent of GDP compared to 167 percent of GDP in the RMI).

Financial Relations Between the Federated States of Micronesia and the United States The United Nations created the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) in 1947, with the United States (U.S.) as the trustee. In 1978, four of the TTPI districts (Pohnpei, Chuuk, Yap, and Kosrae) voted to form a self-governing federation under the Constitution of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). This came into effect in 1979. As part of the post- Trustee relationship, the Compact of Free Association (the Compact) was signed between the FSM and the U.S. in 1982. The Compact eventually came into force in November 1986. The three goals of the Compact are: (i) to secure self-government for the FSM; (ii) assure certain national security rights for the FSM and the U.S.; and (iii) assist the FSM’s efforts to promote economic self-sufficiency. Efforts to promote economic self-sufficiency were to be accomplished primarily through direct financial assistance to the government. The largest funding provision provides specific levels of funding over a 15-year period (1986/87-2000/01) with amounts decreasing every five years (Table). These funds are provided to cover general government and capital expenditures (40 percent are required to be spent on capital expenditures, although this does not appear to have been met). Additional funding is targeted at specific sectors, including energy, communications, health, and education. If a new funding agreement is not in place by the time the current one expires in 2001, there is provision for an additional two years of financing at the average level of the first 15 years ($88 million). The National government distributes the Compact grants to each government according to a statutory formula. The National govemment receives around 15 percent of current grants and 10 percent of capital grants. The remainder are distributed to the states based on a formula that splits 30 percent of the funding evenly among the four states and the remaining 70 percent according to population.

However, this adjustment had a substantial impact on activity, with real GDP declining by an average of 2% percent per annum during 1995/96-1997/98.* 4. The economic provisions of the Compact agreement with the U.S. expire in 2001, creating uncertainty about the medium-term outlook. Two rounds of negotiations with the U.S. over possible financial assistance post-2001 have taken place. The FSM has proposed that the U.S. provide an annual grant of $84 million per annum (37 percent of current GDP), while also contributing $20 million per annum into a recently established Trust Fund. When the investment income from the Trust Fund is sufficient to replace the Compact grant, the Compact would end. While the U.S. has not responded to this proposal, they have indicated that they will seek to provide future assistance in the form of sector specific grants, rather than general budget support as at present. II. RELENT Ecor4om2 DEVELOPMENTS 5. The economy has rebounded from the recession that followed the public sector downsizing in the mid-1990s. Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 2% percent in 1998/99 and by 3 percent in 1999/00 (Table 1). While the recovery was initially due to the implementation of a number of infrastructure projects in Chuuk and Yap states, more recently private sector activity has also strengthened. Employment increased by an average of 4% percent during these two years, driven by a robust expansion in private sector jobs. After declining modestly in 1998/99, inflation is estimated to have picked up to 2% percent in 1999/00. 6. The consolidated fiscal deficit of the National and the four state governments narrowed to an estimated 1 percent of GDP in 1999/00, from an average of nearly 4 percent of GDP during 1997/98-1998199 (Table 2).3 This was largely due to lower capital expenditures, although the current surplus also widened to 1% percent of GDP as increased expenditures on goods and services were offset by higher external grants and tax collections by the state governments. * The fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30. 3 Under the constitution, the National government has responsibility for domestic policy coordination, foreign policy, and defense, while the state governments, which enjoy substantial autonomy, are responsible for the provision of most economic services including education, health, and public safety, and account for around two-thirds of total government expenditure. The constitution gives the National government the right to determine and collect income and import taxes, while all other taxes are the jurisdiction of the states. National government taxes are then shared with the state in which they are collected. The share of tax revenues transferred to the state governments was increased from 50 percent to 70 percent in October 1998 (80 percent of the fuel tax), with this additional 20 percent designated for capital expenditure. No revenue sharing arrangements are in place for non-tax revenues (including fishing license fees). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- 7. These developments, however, mask differing trends at the National and state government levels. Since 1996/97, the National government has run large budget deficits, and this continued in 1999/00. Over this period, its expenditures have Ftsal Bdmn h-mm e/GDP declined by much less than those of lo 1 _ the states as it has lagged in its workforce reduction efforts, while its I w ’ II revenues have fallen by 5 percent of GDP as a result of a decline in fishing license fees and the introduction of the new revenue sharing arrangements with the states in October 1998. These large deficits have resulted in a substantial decline in its financial asset holdings, from 33 percent of GDP at end- 1996/97 to an estimated 13 percent of GDP at end- 1999/00. However, many of these assets are committed for a range of purposes, and usable financial assets are estimated to have been close to zero by end- 1999/00. 8. The states, on the other hand, have undertaken more significant fiscal reforms since the mid-1990s, and are all estimated to have been in budget surplus in 1999/00. While they have benefited from the change in the revenue sharing arrangement, the states have also reduced their wage bills by an average of 26 percent since 1995/96 (through both reductions in paid weekly work hours and in the number of employees) and increased their own revenue collections by 1 ‘/z percentage points of GDP, largely through higher sales tax rates. However, while the financial Table. Workforce and Payroll Reduction Under the PSRP’ (In oercentl . .

Hence, wage bill figures in this table differ from those in the fiscal tables. 4 Under the PSFW, paid weekly work hours of government employees were reduced as follows: Chuuk to 32 hours (raised back to 36 hours in 1999100); Pohnpei to 36 hours; and Kosrae to 28 hours (from the 32-hour work week that was previously in place). No reduction in paid work hours were made by the National government or Yap state.

The consolidated fiscal deficit is budgeted to remain at about 1 percent of GDP in 2000/01. A narrowing in the current surplus to L/z percent of GDP is expected to be offset by a further decline in capital expenditure. While the National government’s budget deficit is expected to narrow slightly, higher expenditures on wages and salaries in Chuuk, following the decision to return to a 40-hour work week for government employees, is expected to result in the narrowing of the budget surplus at the state government level (it is also likely that Pohnpei will return to a 40-hour work week during 2000/01, although a final decision has not been taken and such a move has not been budgeted). 10. Bank lending has recovered over the past two years. After declining through 1995-1997, bank lending grew by 5 percent in 1998 and by 13 percent in 1999. This has largely been driven by lending to consumers, who have increased their borrowing as employment prospects have improved and as ex-public sector workers have used their severance pay as collateral against new loans. Commercial loans, however, have grown only moderately due to long standing impediments to bank lending to businesses, including the difficulties of using land as collateral (see Section III). As the result, over one-half of bank assets remain deposited in overseas banks. 11. The current account surplus has narrowed as the trade deficit has widened and transfers have declined with the stepdown in Compact payments (Table 3). Exports, which had declined sharply during 1997/98- 1998/99 as El Nino caused some migration of tuna out of the FSM’s territorial waters, recovered strongly during 1999100 with the dissipation of this factor. However, imports are also estimated to have increased with the recovery of the domestic economy and the rise in international oil prices. Partly offsetting the widening trade deficit has been a recovery over the past two years in travel receipts as Japanese Real Effective Exchange Rate Compansons l! 120 I20 (Indices: 1995=1001 115 - - II5 110 - 110 - 105 - 100 . 95 -90 - 85 80 80 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 so-: IMF. l"lDrmllion NCUCC syunn; and *t-luhhtiar.

After appreciating during 1995-1998, the real effective exchange rate has depreciated modestly in recent years (due to the weakening of the dollar against the yen). 5 Given limited access to commercial finance in recent years, deficits at both the National and state government levels have been financed by running down financial asset holdings. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- This, however, has resulted in little improvement in competitiveness against other Pacific islands whose currencies have undergone larger depreciations during this period. 12. Capital account developments in recent years have been dominated by repayments on the external commercial borrowing contracted in the early 1990s. While inflows from the AsDB PSRP loan offset these repayments during 60 Growth of Travel Receipts 50 -fAnmrd-wrhaw~ .+o- ‘..., 1: - 1’ 4 ’ . 1995 1596 1997 1998 1999 2m sowcsa: IMP.

However, external debt, which had reached a peak of 70 percent of GDP in 1992/93, has declined considerably to 29 percent of GDP, while the external debt servicing ratio stood at 50 percent of exports of goods and services in 1999/00 (Table 4). Much of the remaining external commercial borrowing will be repaid by end-2000/01, at which time external debt will largely comprise concessional loans. 13. Economic growth is projected to moderate to 2 percent in 2000/01 (Table 5). The return to a 40-hour work week for government employees in Chuuk (and possibly Pohnpei) will boost private consumption, but government investment is likely to weaken, while the uncertainty about the Compact negotiations will continue to limit private investment. Inflation is expected to remain moderate, while the current account is projected to move into a deficit as the decline in international tuna prices adversely affects exports and oil imports rise further. III. REPORT ON THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS 14. With the economic provisions of the Compact expiring next year, the outlook for the FSM is uncertain. Although negotiations are still proceeding, the authorities are keenly aware that Compact financing in the future is likely to be lower than in the past. Long-term fiscal adjustment scenarios developed under alternate external financing assumptions illustrate the size of the fiscal adjustment that may be required (Annex I). Consequently, at the second FSM Economic Summit in September 1999, and in the subsequent FSA4 Planning Framework, 199%2002, the authorities set out a strategy that seeks to move the economy toward greater self-sufficiency by promoting private sector growth and investment and continuing to reduce the role of the government in the economy. 15. The mission expressed strong support for this strategy, but emphasized the importance of immediately pressing ahead with the reform agenda, rather than waiting until the Compact negotiations were concluded. They noted that compared to other small island economies, the FSM had a very large government sector, was not open to foreign investment, and had also experienced much weaker per capita GDP growth (Box 2).

Economic Growth Performance in Small Island Economies Economic performance has varied considerably among small island economies in recent years. In the Pacific, per capita GDP has been stagnant during 1992-1998, while among Caribbean and Indian Ocean countries it has grown by Per Capita GDP Growth and For@ lovestment 2% percent and 2% percent per annum, respectively. Among the j;; 6 .KNA - 4 Pacific island countries, the FSM and the RMI have been the worst performing with per capita GDP declining by an average of 1 percent per annum in the FSM and by 3 ‘% percent per annum in the RMI. - 2 “I 0 g-2 . - -2 3 RMI =-4 -4 0 1 4 6 s 10 II 14 Fomg Direct tnvcmnmt (pa-cent of GDP) I,A”mP lepI.98 What might explain these differences in growth performance? In a comparative study, Fairbaim and Worrell (1996) argue that the superior growth performance of the Caribbean islands compared to those in the Pacific can be attributed to a number of factors, Per Capita GDP Growth and Public Sector Expenditure I/ %6- 3 .XN* “4- & .

The discussions focused on the authorities’ policies in three main areas: (i) fiscal adjustment; (ii) structural policies to promote private sector growth; and (iii) strengthening the financial sector. A. Fiscal Policy 16. The authorities set out an ambitious medium-term fiscal adjustment strategy in The FSM Planning Framework, 1999-2002. They explained that the strict control of current expenditures, and the wage bill in particular, would remain the cornerstone of their adjustment efforts. However, as substantial cuts in government employment had already been made under the PSRP-although the reductions fell short of the original targets as there were concerns that the provision of essential services was being adversely affected-the focus would largely be on the tight control of government wages, which are significantly higher than those in the private sector. Other areas where the authorities thought potential cost savings could be made included travel and areas of duplication in services between the National and state governments. They hoped that the recent introduction of performance- based budgeting would help identify where resources are not being effectively used. 17. An increase in the tax ratio to 20 percent of GDP is also being targeted over the long term. Current tax collections, at 12 percent of GDP, are exceptionally low compared to other Pacific island countries, and government revenue is reliant on volatile fishing license fees. Efforts to improve tax administration are ongoing, while consideration is being given to introducing a VAT to replace import duties and the Gross Revenue Tax (GRT).6 However, the authorities explained that a number of impediments to the VAT remain, most importantly regarding how the tax would be structured between the National and state governments. 18. The mission agreed with the focus of the authorities’ strategy, noting that despite the fiscal adjustment that has taken place in recent years, government expenditure in the FSM remains high and tax collections low by the standards of most other small island economies in the region (Box 3). While geographic and demographic factors, and the Federal/State fiscal structure, may require somewhat higher government expenditure in the FSM, it is unlikely that such factors would be able to account for the full difference in size. In this context, the mission also noted that while the number of government employees in the FSM appears broadly in line with other Pacific island countries, their wage levels are much higher (with the exception of the RMI). They also argued that the authorities should seek to run budgetary surpluses to allow the build-up of financial assets during any additional period of Compact financing to provide a future income stream and a buffer against shocks. 6 The GRT is levied on the gross receipts of private sector businesses. It is a flat $80 for receipts up to and including $10,000 and 3 percent on the excess. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- Box 3. Fiscal Structure in Selected Pacific Wand Economies A comparison of the fiscal structure in the FSM with other Pacific island economies indicates that (Table): * l The government sector is considerably larger, with government expenditure accounting for 74 percent of GDP. l Current expenditures, in particular spending on wages and salaries, are twice the size of other countries in the region. l The large spending on wages and salaries are due to higher public sector wages; while the share of public sector employment in total population is comparable to other Pacific island countries. l Spending on health and education is well above the regional average, while capital spending is also above average. l Government revenue is highly reliant on external grants, which account for over one-half of revenue.

The mission therefore expressed disappointment at the lack of fiscal consolidation in the 2000/01 budget. They argued for the implementation of measures to at least offset the anticipated deterioration in the current balance in 2000/O 1, which would bring the overall budget to near balance. Given the large deficits that the National government has run in recent years, and its low level of usable financial assets, the mission thought that it would need to bear the burden of adjustment in the short-term, and recommended that expenditures be thoroughly reviewed with a view to cutting employment in non-core areas and reducing the large travel budget. With regard to the states, they urged that any increase in the number of work hours of government employees be offset by additional employment reductions to maintain the wage bill at current levels. Subsidies to public enterprises also need to be reduced at both levels of government. 20. Over the medium term, the mission agreed that most of the adjustment in current expenditure would need to come on the wage side. However, they also thought that additional employment reductions in non-core areas, might be possible. The mission supported the authorities’ tax reform proposals, believing that the introduction of the VAT would improve the efficiency of the tax system, although improvements in administrative capacities were likely to be needed frrst.7 The mission also suggested that the wages and salaries tax rate be raised for higher income earners and the tax be broadened to include non- wage income. Further, they argued that public enterprises should be brought under the GRT net to ensure a level playing field with the private sector. 21. Further reform of public sector enterprises is also needed to improve efficiency and limit the drain on budget resources. While good progress had been made by some states in bringing their public utilities to a full cost-recovery basis, substantial subsidies are still being paid in other states. Further, progress in reforming and exiting from public sector ventures in the fishing and agricultural sectors has been disappointing across all levels of government. The mission noted that employment and wages in public sector enterprises, in contrast to the government sector, had risen in recent years. The authorities agreed that progress in reforming public enterprises had been mixed, but noted that it was politically difficult for the governments to accept the losses on their original investments that would be entailed by exiting from these ventures. 7 The advantages of a VAT over a tariff will be greater, all else equal, the lower the share of imports in GDP, the smaller the proportion of consumption that is imported, and the larger the share of intermediate goods in imports (see Recent Experience with the Value-Added Tax-Background Paper, EBS/OO/14, Supplement 1). While the structure of the FSM economy suggests that the gains may be smaller than for other counties, they still appear to be positive. Further, as the economy develops over the medium-term, the benefits of a VAT will increase. VATS have been successfully introduced in other Pacific island countries (Fiji, Samoa, and Vanuatu).

The mission agreed with the authorities on the need to protect the provision of health and education services. However, they asked about the scope for improving efficiency in these areas as expenditure is high in comparison to other Pacific island countries, but outcomes (including low school retention rates and the need for medical referrals overseas) are generally poor (Box 4).8 The authorities responded that one of their goals was to shift expenditure toward preventive, rather than curative, care, including by increasing expenditure on primary health care and reducing it on overseas medical referrals. To this end, several states have switched their overseas medical referrals to the Philippines from Hawaii, 23. The mission emphasized the importance of improving accountability and transparency in the government’s fiscal operations. They noted that at present the budget documents do not make a distinction between revenue and financing items, thereby hampering the assessment of the fiscal stance. Budget documents also lack details on the policy goals of the government and how the budget seeks to achieve these goals, while audit reports of the government accounts are published with an excessive lag (the report for the National government is still not available for the 1998/99 fiscal year). Recent audit reports are also not available for a number of public enterprises. The authorities responded that they were aware of these problems, and were working to improve the situation. They particularly expected that the introduction of performance-based budgeting would help to more clearly establish the goals of government and heighten its accountability. 24. The mission stressed that any additional funding received from the U.S. during 2001/02-2002103 if the Compact negotiations are not concluded by end-October 2001 should be saved in the Trust Fund. The authorities agreed, in principle, to this recommendation, but noted that given the predetermined formula for the allocation of Compact money, that would be a decision that would have to be taken by each of the governments. With respect to the establishment of the Trust Fund, the mission welcomed the clear and comprehensive legislation governing its operations (which is similar to that in Tuvalu) and the requirements for annual reporting and disclosure. B. Structural Reforms to Promote Private Sector Growth 25. The authorities explained that they are trying to simplify the foreign investment approvals process and make it more transparent, but acknowledged that progress has been mixed. The need to meet the requirements of both the National and the state governments has in the past complicated the approval process for foreign investors. “Model” legislation has been proposed that would more clearly establish the criteria foreigners need to meet to invest in different sectors of the economy and would reduce the need for investors to obtain permits from different levels of government. However, while some governments have 8 The AsDB’s 1999 human resource development study found that the poor performance of the education system resulted from a lack of: proper facilities, well trained teachers, planning, monitoring and, most importantly, management.

Government spending on health and education is relatively high in the FSM, accounting for 7% percent and 13 L/z percent of GDP respectively. On a per capita basis, health spending is much higher than in other countries in the region, excepting the RMI, while education expenditure (per school age child) is the highest (Table 1). However, standard health and education indicators suggest that outcomes have been no better, and in some cases worse, than in other Pacific island countries. Tnhle 1.

While there is no easy answer to this question, the structure of the health budget suggests that available resources are not being used in the most effective manner. For example, ‘fable 2.

With regard to education, many teachers do not meet the minimum qualifications required to teach. What can be done to improve the efficiency of service delivery? Given the need to improve the quality of health and education outcomes, while also reducing government expenditure over the medium-term, it is essential that improvements are made in the efficiency of service provision. Potential areas for reform, include: reducing expenditures on overseas referrals and focusing more resources on primary health care; increasing flexibility in resource allocation; improving the quality of service providers through better training; and increasing user charges for higher income earners.

Pohnpei, in particular, has decided to continue with its Foreign Investment Board which considers proposals on a case-by-case basis. The mission argued that in order to foster a more conducive environment for foreign investment, the authorities should move to a simple and transparent licensing system, with, if necessary, a very limited negative list. 26. Issues regarding land tenure continue to limit the use of land for commercial purposes. Land ownership is slowly evolving from multiple to individual title, but titling and registration are slow, there is no commercial market for land, lease lengths are short, and foreigners are not permitted to own land. The commercial banks, in particular, expressed their disappointment at the slow pace of reform as the inability to use land as collateral is a significant constraint on their lending business. In response to the mission’s inquiry about the prospects for land reform, the authorities noted that while the constraints that the current system placed on private sector development were well recognized, land reform was a very difficult issue given the cultural importance of land in the FSM. However, some progress is being made-for example the recent increase in the maximum lease length f?om 25 to 55 years in Pohnpei state- and further reforms are being proposed as part of an AsDB Private Sector Development Program loan. 27. The authorities did not think that the Asia crisis, or the loss of competitiveness relative to other Pacific island countries, had had a significant impact on the external sector. While there had been a modest effect on tourist arrivals, the decline in exports during 1997/98-l 998/99 was largely due to climatic, rather than demand or competitiveness, factors. The mission noted, however, that as the FSM seeks to develop a more vibrant private sector over the medium-term, export competitiveness will be an important issue. Given that the use of the U.S. dollar-which the mission and authorities agreed continued to serve the country well by imparting monetary stability-precluded nominal exchange rate adjustment, improving competitiveness would need to focus on lowering the domestic cost structure, particularly through the control of wages. C. Strengthening the Financial Sector 28. Measures are needed to strengthen the regulation and supervision of the financial sector.’ While generally satisfied with the ongoing improvements in the regulatory and supervisory framework, which are being made with the help of technical assistance from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC), the authorities recognized that continued efforts were needed to bring the FSM closer to regional best practice. They 9 The three commercial banks that operate in the FSM are licensed and regulated by the Banking Board. Two of the three banks are branches of U.S. banks and are therefore subject to U.S. prudential requirements, and their deposits are insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Under the Compact agreement with the U.S., the FDIC also insures the deposits of the locally incorporated Bank of the FSM. There is no offshore financial center in the FSM.

Consideration is also being given to introducing bankruptcy legislation to make foreclosure easier. The mission welcomed these proposals. 29. The mission recommended that the government-owned Development Bank, which is not currently subject to any supervision, be brought under the auspices of the Banking Board. While the Bank has voluntarily moved closer to the classification and provision standards of the commercial banks over the past two years, it remains unclear whether it has fully recognized and provisioned for its nonperforming loans. The authorities responded that it was likely that the Development Bank would only come under the supervision of the Banking Board in the event that it began to collect public deposits. D. Other Issues 30. The FSM’s trade regime is relatively open and rated “4” on the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness. The import duty rates are 4 percent for general merchandise and 3 percent for food products, while a number of items are subject to higher rates ranging from 25-100 percent. The FSM is a member of the South Pacific Forum, and is involved in the Pacific Regional Trade Agreement (PARTA) negotiations which are seeking to achieve a free trade area among Forum Island Countries by 2012. 31. Statistical deficiencies continue to impede effective surveillance. Some progress has been made since the last Article IV consultation in 1998, including the publication of the 1999 Statistical Yearbook and the calculation of an economy-wide CPI, while the authorities and STA are also working toward including a page for the FSM in Infevnational Financial Statistics. However, substantial weaknesses remain, particularly in the areas of national accounts and balance of payments statistics, but also in the fiscal accounts. Further, only banking sector data are being reported to the Fund on a regular basis at present. The mission stressed the importance of improving data compilation and reporting data on a regular and timely basis. The authorities responded that they were continuing their efforts to strengthen statistical functions, but the lack of suitably qualified staff, as well as high staff turnover, remained significant impediments. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 32. Considerable policy challenges lie ahead for the FSM. Substantial fiscal adjustment has taken place in recent years, particularly at the state government level, as the authorities have commendably implemented an AsDB-supported public sector reform program. While this adjustment initially resulted in a substantial contraction in activity, the economy has rebounded over the past two years. It is now important to sustain this growth momentum, while also placing the economy in a stronger position to withstand any further reduction in Compact financing should it eventuate. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- 33. In this regard, the recent fiscal deficits are a cause for concern. Government financial asset holdings have declined, and the National government now has limited usable financial assets at its disposal, giving it little buffer to absorb unanticipated budgetary shocks. A priority needs to be placed on returning the budget to surplus to begin to rebuild government asset holding to provide an income stream over the medium term and a buffer against shocks. To achieve this, the National government needs to make further progress toward the employment reductions originally envisaged under the PSRP, and reduce other expenses, including on travel and subsidies. At the state government level, the impact of recent moves by Chuuk (and possibly Pohnpei) to restore 40-hour work weeks for government employees need to be offset by employment reductions, while subsidies again should be reduced. 34. The medium-term outlook for. the economy is clouded by the uncertainty about the level and form of future Compact funding. Given the continued reliance of the FSM economy on this financing, further reductions will inevitably entail adjustments in the domestic economy. However, the challenge will be to implement policies that minimize the impact, both by promoting private sector growth and by continuing to reduce the role of government in the economy in a gradual and forward-looking manner. The reform agenda that has been set out by the authorities in The FSM Planning Framework, 1999-2002 is an important step in this direction. T’he generation of fiscal surpluses will also allow the build- up of assets in the Trust Fund in anticipation of the eventual ending of Compact payments. 35. Further reductions in government current expenditure (as a share of GDP) and steps to boost revenues are needed. The reduction in expenditure will primarily need to focus on government wages, which remain considerably higher than those in the private sector, and in the region more generally, but also on travel costs, areas of overlap between the National and state governments, and subsidies to public enterprises, including by exiting from business ventures in the agricultural and fisheries sectors. As well as ensuring the generation of fiscal surpluses, these measures will help protect expenditures on health, education, and capital projects from any decline in government resources. 36. Tax revenues remain very low in the FSM, and government finances are overly reliant on volatile fishing license fees. In this context, the authorities’ objective of raising the tax ratio to 20 percent of GDP is appropriate. This will require improved tax administration, some increase in the wages and salaries tax rate for higher income earners and an expansion of the tax to nonwage income, and the introduction of a VAT in a revenue positive manner. To ensure competitive neutrality between the public and private sectors, public enterprises should also be made subject to the GRT. 37. Efforts are needed to improve accountability and transparency in the government’s fiscal operations. The budget documents need to place more emphasis on the policy goals of the government, while audit reports for the governments and public enterprises should be published on a regular and timely basis.

The longer-term prosperity of the FSM is crucially dependent on the environmentalIy sustainable development of a vibrant private sector.” The FSM economy can ill afford to place obstacles in the way of private investment in addition to those that naturally occur due to its small size and distance from major markets. Reforms to reduce impediments to private sector development have begun, but much more needs to be done. Foreign investment regulations remain excessively cumbersome and non-transparent in some states, while the lack of uniform regulations between the different governments is a significant deterrent to potential investors. Further progress is also required to bring more land into commercial use. 39. With regard to the financial sector, measures are needed to address current constraints on bank lending and to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory system. For the banking system to play a full role in the development of the economy, factors that currently impede lending, including the difficulties of using land as collateral and of foreclosing, need attention. The proposed amendments to the Banking Act will strengthen existing legislation and should be enacted as soon as possible, while the recent steps to upgrade supervisory capacities will need to continue. It is also important to bring the Development Bank, which is not supervised at present, under the purview of the Banking Board. 40. While welcome progress is being made, statistical deficiencies and the lack of reporting to the Fund continue to impede effective surveillance. Further efforts are needed to improve data collection and dissemination, and to improve reporting to the Fund. 41. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Federated States of Micronesia remain on the 24-month cycle. lo The Report of the Commonwealth Secretariat/World Bank Joint Task Force on Small States highlights insensitive tourism development and over-exploitation of nonrenewable resources as mistakes made by many small island countries.

The main assumptions made in the scenarios are: l Agreement is reached on a new Compact by October 200 1. l The government seeks to maintain usable financial assets of 40 percent of its expenditures as a buffer against unanticipated shocks (broadly the level held during the first-half of the 1990s). l The rate of return on assets in the Trust Fund is 9 percent per annum; the return on government liquid asset holdings is 6% percent per annum. l Structural reforms result in a pick-up in growth to 2% percent (in line with the average of other Pacific islands). Inflation is in line with the U.S. at 2% percent. Baseline scenario It is assumed that under the new Compact, the FSM receives annual budgetary financing of $84 million per annum, but this is not indexed for inflation. The U.S. is also assumed to contribute $20 million per annum into the Trust Fund. When the assets of the Trust Fund yield sufficient investment income to replace the Compact payments, the Compact is assumed to end (this happens in 2020/21). In the scenario, government current expenditures are reduced gradually (as a percent of GDP), from around 55 percent at present to 37 percent by the end of the Compact period, while new tax measures result in a 4 percentage points increase in the revenue ratio. Despite the decline in external grants, this is sufficient to maintain a fiscal surplus, averaging 2 percent of GDP during the remainder of the Compact, and to build up, and then maintain, government usable financial assets at their target level. External debt gradually declines (as a percent of GDP) as the government maintains its policy of only contracting loans on concessional terms. In 2021122, the assets in the Trust Fund have reached 160 percent of GDP and the investment income is sufficient to replace the Compact payments. At this point, the Compact financing ends, and the government begins to use the income from the fund for budgetary purposes. Alternative scenario Payments under the new Compact are assumed to be lower at $74 million per annum, while the U.S. contributes only $9 million per annum into the Trust Fund. The FSM also contributes $9 million per annum into the Fund (assumed to be made from the budget). The more rapid withdrawal of Compact financing and the requirement for the FSM to contribute into the Trust Fund requires an immediate and larger reduction in government expenditure and somewhat greater tax effort than in the baseline scenario. Despite these efforts, in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - ANNEX I initial years the government runs a smaller surplus and its usable financial assets decline to around 27 percent of expenditure. Over the medium-term, however, the fiscal surplus rises to around 5 percent of GDP until government usable financial assets are built-up to 40 percent of expenditure. As in the baseline scenario, the investment income from the assets in the Trust Fund is sufficient to replace the Compact payments in 2021/22 (although, given the lower level of Compact funding in this scenario, the needed accumulation of assets in the Trust Fund is less than in the baseline scenario).

In September 1993, a country economic report was prepared as part of the second Pacific Islands Regional Economic Report. The third Regional Economic Report, finalized in June 1995, was a thematic report focusing on trade, tourism, fisheries, forestry, and regional cooperation and contained additional material on the country. In 1998, the Bank completed the fourth Regional Economic Report which discussed how the development agenda of government could be enhanced by focusing on core functions, improving spending patterns, and having in place efficient budgetary processes. The Bank approved a grant of about $140,000 in 1995 through the Institutional Development Fund to help improve the institutional capacity for coordinating fisheries development policies across the four states and to improve the performance of fisheries parastatals, including through privatization. ’ Prepared on the basis of the input from the World Bank staff.

There have also been 29 technical assistance grants as of October 2000. The shortage of skilled and professional manpower, weak policies, and institutional constraints have led to some delays in implementation. The 1995 Pacific Strategy Study has been the guiding framework governing AsDB assistance, while a new Strategy Study is under preparation. The focus of AsDB’s strategy is to provide policy advice and facilitate institutional development and donor coordination. The main objective is to assist the government in achieving sustainable and self-reliant economic growth. Structural constraints will be addressed by focusing the country assistance program on improving factor market policies (land, labor, and capital) and strengthening institutional capacities. In conjunction with other donors, the AsDB is funding a Policy Advisory Team to provide advice and support to the government. Consistent with this role, the AsDB has organized Consultative Group Meetings in December 1995, October 1996, January 1998, and February 2000. The meetings reviewed economic performance, discussed economic development strategies and policies, shared information on donor programs and coordinated efforts, and reached agreement with the government on policy measures and actions. ’ Prepared on the basis of input from the AsDB staff.

However, data are compiled with a long lag, and very little are transmitted to the Fund on a regular basis. Substantial assistance to improve statistics has been provided from headquarters and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC), but the authorities’ commitment-to follow up has been slow. Real Sector The last official GDP estimate is for 1996. No wage, unemployment, or aggregate production indicators are available. Recent GDP estimates are calculated by the AsDB’s Economic Management Policy Advisory Team (EMPAT) from tax and social security data. The authorities have published a quarterly consumer price index for Pohnpei from the first quarter of 1997, but the publication lag needs to be shortened. A new quarterly CPI index for each state and the nation as a whole has been calculated since the first quarter of 1999. Government Finance The National and the state governments and public sector enterprises publish annual audit reports detailing their fiscal operations, but these are not in GFS format. Long publication lags also exist. The authorities do not report government finance statistics data for inclusion in the Fund’s statistical publications, but the consolidated fiscal accounts were published in the 1999 Yearbook. Further improvements in the quality of the fiscal data are dependent on greater cooperation between the National and state governments through timely and accurate reporting of data to the Office of Planning and Statistics. Monetary Accounts A monetary survey is not prepared because of the absence of data on currency in circulation. Reports on the consolidated balance sheets of commercial banks and the FSM Development Bank are received by STA from the Banking Commissioner on a monthly basis. Final preparations for the establishment of a country page in IFS are being made with the assistance of STA. Balance of Payments The authorities do not produce balance of payments.statistics, and little information on the external sector is collected. Balance of payments data in this staff report have been estimated by the mission team.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Federated States of Micronesia On January 5, 2001, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Federated States of Micronesia.’ Background The economy of the Federated States of Micronesia is dependent on United States (U.S.) financing provided through the economic provisions of the Compact of Free Association (the Compact). The economic provisions of the agreement, however, expire in 2001, and while two rounds of negotiations with the U.S. over possible financial assistance after this date have taken place, no new agreement has yet been reached. Economic activity is dominated by the public sector, and the private sector has developed largely to meet the demands of the government and its workers. Small contributions also come from agriculture, fisheries, and tourism. In line with the Compact agreement, two stepdowns in U.S. funding have already taken place. Domestic adjustment was postponed following the first stepdown in 1991 by recourse to external commercial borrowing, which was secured against future Compact financing. However, following the second stepdown in 1996, and faced with the debt service burden on existing borrowing, significant domestic adjustment was required. With an independent exchange rate policy precluded by the use of the US. dollar, fiscal policy has borne the burden of this adjustment. Under an AsDB-assisted Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP), government expenditure has been reduced significantly since the mid-1990s. ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles’of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, fhe Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

While the recovery was initially due to the implementation of a number of infrastructure projects, more recently private sector activity has also strengthened. After declining modestly in 1998199, inflation picked up to 2% percent in 1999100. The consolidated fiscal deficit of the National and the four state governments narrowed to an estimated 1 percent of GDP in 1999/00, from an average of nearly 4 percent of GDP during 1997/98-1998/99. Trends have differed, however, between the National and state governments. Since 1996197, the National government has run large budget deficits as its expenditures have not declined in line with its revenues, which have fallen as a result of lower fishing license fees and the introduction of the new revenue sharing arrangements with the states in October 1998. The states, on the other hand, have undertaken significant fiscal reforms since the mid-1990s and are all estimated to have been in budget surplus in 1999/00. While they have benefited from the change in the revenue sharing arrangement, they have also reduced their wage bills and increased their revenue collections. However, medical arrears owed to foreign hospitals by the states are estimated at $3-4 million (about I’/2 percent of GDP). After declining during 1995-1997, bank lending grew by 5 percent in 1998 and by 13 percent in 1999. This growth has largely been driven by lending to consumers, while lending to business has remained subdued, partly due to long standing impediments, including the difficulties of using land as collateral. Over one-half of commercial bank assets remain deposited in overseas banks. The current account surplus has narrowed in recent years as the trade deficit has widened and transfers have declined with the stepdown in Compact payments. Exports, which declined sharply during 1997/98-1998/99 as El Nino caused some migration of tuna out of the FSM’s territorial waters, recovered strongly during 1999100 with the dissipation of this factor. However, imports also increased with the recovery of the domestic economy and the rise in international oil prices. Partly offsetting the widening trade deficit has been a recovery over the past two years in travel receipts as Japanese visitors have begun to return to the islands. External debt, which reached a peak of 70 percent of GDP in 1992/93, declined to 29 percent of GDP in 1999100, while the external debt servicing ratio has fallen to 80 percent of exports of goods and services. Much of the remaining external commercial borrowing will be repaid by end-2000/01, at which time external debt will largely comprise concessional loans.
