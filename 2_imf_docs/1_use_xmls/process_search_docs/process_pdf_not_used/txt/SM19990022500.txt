In concluding the 1998 Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka on July 27, 1998, Executive Directors stressed the need to address the longstanding economic problems that were impeding Sri Lanka’s growth potential. They encouraged the authorities to build on recent successes by making a firther effort to strengthen macroeconomic policies and accelerate structural reforms. It was hoped that such an effort could be supported by financial resources from the Fund. 2. Improvements in macroeconomic management and structural reform have been achieved against a difficult political background. The conduct of the civil war continues to demand policy makers’ attention. Progress toward resolving the ethnic conflict has been limited and periodically there are major military campaigns. The governing People’s Alliance won island-wide provincial elections held in April-June 1999, though not decisively, and there was a strong showing by the leftist JVP party. The Parliamentary and Presidential elections are set for late 2000, but with the possibility that they will be advanced, the country is in full election- mode. With the high degree of political uncertainty, the authorities are u:nwilling to take unpopular policy initiatives. 3. Against this background, the 1999 Article IV Consultation discussions focussed on ways to strengthen macroeconomic fundamentals and resume progress toward medium- term fiscal consolidation in the 2000 budget. The structural reforms required to 13 Sri Lanka to a permanently higher sustainable growth path as soon as the political situation permits were also discussed. The authorities agreed that consideration of a new ESAF arrangement would be premature at this stage. II. THEECONOMICSETTING A. Longer-Term Perspective 4. Over the last decade, Sri Lanka’s economy has grown steadily, but at a relatively slow rate. Underlying this modest performance have been relatively low levels of saving and investment. Particularly striking has been the impact of prolonged periods of public dissaving, reflected in substantial fiscal deficits that averaged more than 10 percent of GDP. Recently, a poor revenue effort, overstafflng, high military spending, and sizable subsidies and transfers have been major factors affecting the fiscal outturn. During the late 1980s and early 199Os, financial markets were liberalized and the outward orientation of the economy was significantly increased and a more diversified export base established. Progress was also made in other areas, most notably privatization. However, less improvement was made in other priority areas including overall fiscal adjustment, civil service restructuring, state trading monopolies, and financial and labor market reforms. Moreover, fiscal pressures have constrained spending on health and education, undermining Sri Lanka’s substantial past achievements in this area. The economic cost of the civil conflict has been very high (Box 1). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- Box 1. What Has Been the Economic Cost of the Civil War? Background: In 1948, when Sri Lanka gained independence from Britain, the country was expected to adjust quickly to its new sovereign and independent status. Sri Lanka enjoyed a high literacy rate, a solid parliamentary system, and a politicahy sophisticated electorate which had exercised universal adult franchise since the early 1930s. In the early 198Os, it was still common for Sri Lanka to be labeled a “model Third World democracy.” Yet, the country became mired in ethnic division, culminating in the “anti-Tamil riots” of 1983. About 2,000 people reportedly died in the riots and more than 100,000 people were displaced. Since then, some 60,000 people have disappeared or been killed, and one-tenth of the total population has been displaced from their homes at one time or another. In addition to the direct conflict with the LTTE (the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam), the government has also had to deal with an extremist Sinhalese group, the JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna-People’s Liberation Front) which launched a sustained and bloody attempt to overthrow the Sri Lankan State during 1987-90. Military expenditures have risen from less than 1% percent of GDP in 1983 to more than 5 percent of GDP in recent years-exceeding the amount spent on education and health. Direct costs: The economic costs that have been directly attributed to the conflict include the opportunity cost of military spending by both government and LTTE, government spending on relief services and related pensions, and the cost of destroyed infrastructure. Indirect costs: These include forgone income resulting from a lower level of physical and human capital, associated with lower foreign investment and reduced tourist arrivals.

Recent studies by private institutions/NGOs estimate the economic costs of the conflict during 1984-96 at between Rs 1% billion and Rs 2% billion. Military wages and activities associated with the war efforts will have had some positive GDP impact. However, with a bloated military organization the economy has become increasingly dependent on the conflict and more difficult to restructure. Impact of aid: The donor community has become increasingly concerned that its assistance has been used directly or indirectly to finance the conflict-providing a disincentive to push for a political conclusion. While donors stand ready to assist in a major rehabilitation program in the North and East once peace is established, their efforts presently are limited to relief and minor rehabilitation. They have criticized the government for failing to take the lead. The Sri Lanka Development Forum, the donors meeting organized by the World Bank and scheduled for December 1999, will focus on Peace and Reconstruction.

Despite the Asian crisis and the civil conflict, macroeconomic performance was satisfactory in many respects in 1998. Though lower than in 1997, real GDP Figure 1. Sri Lanka: Real Growth. 1993-99 growth was 4% percent, broadly in line with a (In pmwlq a long-run trends (Table 1 and Figure 1).

Higher private, and especially corporate, savings pushed the domestic savings ratio to 19 percent, narrowing the savings- investment gap to 2 percent of GDP. 6. Favorable changes in the terms of trade in 1998 reduced inflation. As measured by the 12-month change in the Colombo 7 Consumer Price Index, inflation declined to 3% percent at end-l 998 (Figure 2). Key factors in this outcome were lower import prices, favorable weather, and adequate food supply. There was also declining activity in the second half of 1998 and some temporary monetary tightening. The 1998 external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) fell to 2 percent of GDP as tea export prices rose sharply while import prices (oil and wheat) declined significantly (Figures 3 and 4). 7. Nevertheless, although the medium-term external vulnerability is not especially high, the near-term economic outlook is less encouraging. The quarterly path of GDP indicates a slowing down of growth since mid- 1998 (GDP in 19994 1 was only 23/4 percent above 1998Ql) and growth is projected by the staff to reach only 3% percent for all of 1999 because of depressed export markets and weakening private sector activity.’ After initially depreciating in 1998 in response to movements of currencies affected by the Asian crisis, the rupee appreciated by more than 7 percent in real effective terms during the first half of 1999. ‘The authorities anticipate a strong recovery in the second half of 1999, suggesting annual growth of 4 percent. But the expected stagnation of government spending will likely negate this impetus. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- Figure 3.

In periodic attempts to limit the pace of depreciation, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has sold $200 million of foreign exchange since early 1998, while exchange rates offered by the commercial Figure 5. Sri LsnLa: Gmss OiXcial Rcsems. 1993-99 banks have been at, or close to, the bottom of the CBSL band.’ The external outlook for the remainder of 1999 is fragile, in view of the sharp reversal of the terms of trade (oil prices have jumped and tea prices have fallen back). For the near term, the current account deficit will increase sharply-exports are projected to decline by 2 percent in value terms, while imports are projected to rise by 5 percent, in ” . . . I\ . part rerlectmg arrcrart purcnases as part ot Air Lanka’s expansion program. A prospective reserve accumulation in the second half of the year is contingent on large privatization receipts. Nevertheless, the declining external debt to GDP ratio, reasonable reserve coverage of short-term debt, the high share of concessional external debt, and limited portfolio flows, suggest that external vulnerability should not be a major problem unless the balance of payments deteriorates further. 8. Greatly affected by temporary food supply factors, inflation performance has been mixed in early 1999 and inflationary expectations remain high. Inflation rose to 7% percent at end-April 1999 on a 12-month basis, before falling to 43/ percent in August. Despite the recent slowing of consumer prices, led by a good harvest and a strong domestic supply of agricultural products, inflationary expectations remain generally high because of the persistent depreciation of the currency. Moreover, the business community is not convinced that inflation 2The CBSL continues to manage the float of the rupee by announcing every day the rates at which it stands ready to buy and sell (within a band of 2 percent). The CBSL does not announce any prospective path for the band. The intervention rates are based on various measures of the real effective exchange rate and the latest cross rate developments.

The economy lacks an effective nominal anchor, with a worrisome fiscal position and a central bank with limited autonomy. The government lost control over the budget in the latter part of 1998 when it failed to contain or offset defense spending overruns and revenue shortfalls. The overall fiscal deficit rose to 9% percent of GDP in 1998 (compared with an original budget target of 6% percent), partly reversing the progress achieved over the previous three years (Figure 6).4 This outcome reflected in equal measure a failure to achieve the budgeted cuts in current expenditure (especially on defense), and a shortfall in tax revenue, principally from the goods and services tax (GST).’ As a result, public savings were sharply negative and domestic bank financing was 2 percentage points of GDP higher than projected. To Figure 6. Sri Lanka: Fiscal Aggreg;ater. 1993-99 (Ill p.reeat 0r QDP) bridge the financing gap, the government borrowed $100 million in foreign currency (% percent of GDP) fi-om the commercial banks. In the original 1999 Budget, the authorities set out ambitious revenue and deficit targets seeking to increase tax revenue to 16 perent of 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 199* 1999 - GDP and lower the overall deficit (excluding grants) to 6 percent of GDP. However, there were few measures introduced to effect this improvement apart from projecting a reduction in military spending of 1% percent of GDP. Moreover, revenue developments in late 1998 and so far this year suggest that these targets will not be met. 3Changes in broad money affect underlying inflation with a lag of about 3-4 quarters. However, the impact on the overall price indices is often marked by sharp changes in food prices. For a discussion of the determinants of inflation and weaknesses of the consumer price indices, see the 1999 Recent Economic and Policy Developments paper. 4The outturn substantially exceeded the estimate given in the November 1998 Budget speech; all fiscal aggregates cover general government (central government and provincial councils). ‘The GST was introduced on April 1, 1998 at a standard rate of 12% percent, although the revenue-neutral rate had been estimated at about 17 percent. Several technical problems have occurred and the tax yield was reduced by refunds, especially in the garment export sector, well above Finance Ministry projections, For further discussion see the 1999 Recent Economic and Policy Developments paper.

Monetary policy has been constrained by the fiscal situation, requiring high real interest rates to counter exchange rate and inflationary pressures. Broad money has been growing at an annual rate of 13-14 percent since early 1998. The decline in the relative contributions of net foreign inflows and private sector credit growth offset the sharp increase in lending to the government, a trend maintained through end-June 1999 (Figure 7). Citing declining inflation and stable exchange markets, the CBSL has lowered its overnight repurchase rate (from 12.1 percent in September 1998 to 9.5 percent from July 30, 1999). However, the interbank call rate, which is the CBSL’s operational target, has remained stable (in the range of 11-14 percent) since early 1998, while the 3-month treasury bill rate has gradually inched up (to nearly 12 percent) (Figure 8).6 Real interest rates (about 8-10 percent for loans and 4 percent for short-term deposits) are higher than in many Asian countries. 11. The financial sector and capital markets remain depressed. Banks continue to have poor portfolios, labor problems, and worsening profitability, while activity and share prices on the Colombo stock market Figure 9. Sri Lanka: Stock Market Pcrformmos, 1994-99 (Ixnury 1994=100. U.S. dollarlcms) 130 I , 130 declined further. Foreign investors were net sellers in 1998. Despite some recent recovery, at end-July 1999 the All Share Index was still nearly 30 percent below the peak of last year, before the nuclear tests carried out in the region affected market confidence. This behavior is in stark contrast to that of other markets in the region (Figure 9). %a11 rates rose very sharply in April to 20 percent because of a temporary liquidity shortage caused by seasonal demand for currency, but subsequently they fell back to 11-12 percent.

The authorities emphasized that their commitment to macroeconomic stability and structural reform had not wavered, but they were not in a position to move quickly. The government’s principal objective remains to achieve a lasting solution to the ethnic conflict, a goal that is critical for economic stability and sustainable growth. Parti;san politics militated against public pronouncements or even open discussion in the pre-election period, so that the government’s position on many structural issues could not be stated in clear and specific terms. A. Medium-Term Strategy 13. For the future, the government was committed to building a strong private sector- driven economy in which rising employment and per capita income would be the key to reducing poverty. However, the economy seems to be stuck in a rut of chronic fiscal deficits, inadequate growth and high inflationary expectations. The authorities agreed that a baseline scenario under which these trends continued was not acceptable (Table 5). The staffs medium- term growth strategy-in line with expectations for a future ESAF and similar to, but more ambitious than, that of the central bank-would require sustained low inflation and higher levels of savings and investment. Development of the private sector would further be promoted through fundamental reforms, especially in the areas of finance, trade, and labor markets. Based on such policies, the macroeconomic framework could envisage annual GDP growth of 6-7 percent, with inflation moderating to below 4 percent. The overall fiscal deficit would need to be brought down to 3% percent of GDP, with the external current account deficit financed by rising private capital inflows, offsetting a trend decline in official assistance. (Annex I provides more details of both the baseline and growth scenarios.) B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 14. The authorities noted that monetary and exchange rate policies were aimed at maintaining external competitiveness while lowering inflationary pressures. At the same time, the CBSL saw a role for monetary policy in promoting economic growth. In real effective terms, the rupee remained appreciated compared with before the Asian crisis. But the authorities did not favor a step adjustment of the exchange rate because Iof the impact on inflation. They preferred to continue to manage the exchange rate flexibly and expected to continue to adjust the band at its current pace for the rest of this year. They did not rule out additional central bank intervention to smooth the adjustment path (Figure 10). 15. The mission noted that the policy of a managed floating exchange rate had generally been satisfactory at retaining competitiveness but-absent fiscal control-it gave an inflationary bias to the system. The vicious cycle of inflation/depreciation will continue until sufficiently tight monetary policies can reduce inflationary expectations and allow the exchange rate to stabilize. The mission stressed that in the period ahead the CBSL should refrain from large scale intervention to support the rupee in the face of further downward pressure. The mission also noted that the narrowness of the current band increased the tendency for commercia1 bank rates to stay at the limits of the band.

The authorities, however, were concerned that such a move would foster larger day-to-day volatility, given the lack of depth of the foreign exchange market. 16. The staff stressed that the central bank’s key task in the period ahead should be to maintain inflation within a low single digit range. This goal could be threatened by undue efforts to stimulate the economy and to reduce government debt service costs by easing monetary policy. At the time of the mission, the CBSL projected that annual inflation would reach 9’/2 percent, on a 12-month basis, by end-1999, falling to 5 percent a year later. The team proposed a more ambitious and publicly-stated inflation path. The mission also observed that the central bank’s monetary program, which targeted broad money growth of at least 14 percent in 1999, might not be sufficiently restrained to maintain low inflation, given the lower growth prospects and stable velocity. Moreover, government financing problems risked a substantial overshooting of the domestic credit targets, putting pressure on both the inflation and external objectives. 17. The staff recommended that the CBSL should be prepared to tighten monetary policy by stepping up open market operations. In line with this recommendation, broad money growth could be constrained to no more than 12-12% percent by the end of the year. As long as fiscal policy remained on track and privatization receipts reduced the need for bank financing of the deficit, private sector credit could also grow by 12 percent. The authorities confirmed that they would monitor various indicators in implementing monetary policy, including interbank interest rates, exchange market activity, and inflation and production trends. However, they were concerned about tightening monetary conditions, and thereby discouraging economic growth. 18. Subsequent to the mission, the CBSL used the occasion of the announcement of low inflation data for July to relax monetary conditions. Despite a sharp increase in government bank borrowing, the CBSL reduced the statutory reserve requirement from 12 percent to 11 percent and lowered the Bank Rate from 17 percent to 16 percent, in an effort to lower interest rate spreads.7 The method of calculating reserve requirements was amended to reduce the volatility of the call market. The CBSL also publicly projected an annual average inflation rate of 6 percent for 1999 as a whole, while highlighting the importance of meeting the fiscal target. The staff has raised concerns with the authorities that this easing of monetary policy was premature, especially given the high risk that government borrowing may exceed the target.’ ‘The Bank Rate is used for lender of last resort facilities and had been unchanged since 1991. *If government bank borrowing for 1999 were to be as high as in 1998, the impact could be to increase broad money by 3x2 percent or squeeze the external position further.

The projected fiscal adjustment for 1999, if achieved, would represent a significant improvement in the public finances. The authorities viewed the fiscal outturn in 1998 as an aberration and stressed the improvement in the budget structure, the restraint on operational expenditures, and the increase in public investment. For 1999, they were committed to fiscal consolidation, containing the deficit through lower defense spending, tight expenditure control and improved tax collection. Their original budget target of 6 percent of GDP would not be met because of a temporary shortfall in GST revenue collection and higher debt servicing associated with borrowing in the last quarter of 1998. However, the revised official projections for 1999 showed an overall deficit of 7% percent of GDP, representing a reduction of 1% percent of GDP with respect to the outturn for 1998. A 2 percent of GDP improvement was targeted for public savings. 20. The staff stressed the importance of meeting the target for public savings, and noted that there was considerable risk of further slippage on both revenue and current expenditure unless additional measures were taken. Non-GST tax receipts for the first five months of the year were below the revised path projected for the year, and net GST receipts were on pace for a f?n-ther shortfall of at least l/z percent of GDP. Additional domestic interest payments and transfers to public enterprises were likely, and overruns in military spending always possible. If such slippages occurred, and additional measures were not taken, the overall deficit could easily climb back above 9 percent of GDP. 21. The authorities were confident that the revised fiscal targets would be met, but would review the position when full data for the first half of the year became available. The authorities were not prepared to make any commitment to take corrective actions. Measures suggested by the mission, if revenue performance fell short of target, included increases in the excise duty on kerosene and diesel and reinstatement of the petroleum customs duty. The mission also emphasized that any decision to increase the National Security Levy,’ if military costs are much higher than budgeted, would need to be taken at an early stage so as to produce the desired revenue impact. These adjustments could allow room for the maintenance of development expenditure, while keeping the overall deficit within the revised budget target. 22. The authorities saw the 2000 budget as important for placing fiscal policy back on their announced medium-term path. However, they were not in a position to articulate detailed targets or policy changes. The mission proposed that measures be taken to raise the tax ratio to 16% percent of GDP by increasing the domestic revenue base, given the policy of reducing reliance on trade taxes. The mission proposed an increase in the GST rate to 17 percent, its extension to the retail level (with revenue-sharing for the provincial councils), and a reduction in exemptions. Moreover, the mission recommended a thorough rationalization of all other tax exemptions and an increase in excise duties on petroleum products -with offsetting fare increases for the railways and buses. The authorities noted that investment tax 9A levy applied to most imported and domestic transactions.

The structure of GST would be reexamined, but they stressed that no major changes could be formulated until the tax was fblly tinctioning and operational problems solved. 23. The authorities’ fiscal target for 2000 was to increase public savings by around 2 percent of GDP mainly through expenditure containment. This goal would require overall reductions in current spending, though the authorities aimed to increase spending on education and health (which amount to only 4 percent of GDP). Military spending would be limited, though it wouId remain relatively high. The authorities noted that strict limits would be maintained on the wage bill, with no general wage increases envisaged and some savings fi-om leaving vacancies unfilled. They also would continue a strict budget constraint on social welfare programs, such as Samurdhi, by freezing allocations in nominal terms. Tlo prevent the reemergence of costly budgetary transfers, the authorities intended to adjust prices for wheat and petroleum products as appropriate. lo Provision would also be made ffor the recurrent fiscal costs of f%ture bank restructuring. 24. These plans would limit the overall fiscal deficit in 2000 to 6% percent of GDP and reduce domestic financing. There would still be room for a retrenchment scheme to facilitate civil service restructuring, and an expansion of the capital budget, including the start of the Southern Highway.” Reducing the government’s domestic borrowing requirement would enable the authorities to reduce dependence on the captive sources by issuing bonds with market-determined yields and a full range of maturities. l2 The mission proposed using privatization proceeds to reduce bank borrowing, together with setting a low cap on borrowing from the central bank. Similarly, there would be no need for fLrther recourse to nonconcessional foreign currency loans for budget financing. The staff noted that international bond issues planned by the authorities to test sovereign creditworthiness should not be used to finance the budget. Financial sector D. Structural Reform Agenda13 25. The banking sector is not fully sound -with large volumes of nonperforming loans and low risk-weighted capital adequncy.Though there are several foreign and domestic ‘@I’0 improve the financial position of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation in 1998-99, the government had not reduced retail prices in response to the earlier drop in world oil prices. “The deficit target does not include the initial capital costs of state bank restructuring (see paragraph 26). 12Captive sources are public financial institutions such as the savings bank and provident tinds that have traditionally lent to the government at below market interest rates. 13A summary of key structural issues is shown in the Appendix.

There has also been persistent government interference in the lending operations of the state banks, undermining their commercial viability. As a result, intermediation spreads for the whole banking system are high. In the coming year, increasing strains and stricter supervision standards may worsen the problems.” I Sri Lanka-Bank Soundness I I March 1996 1997 1998 1999 Share of nonperforming loans (as percent of total loans) State-owned banks Domestic private banks 18.9 12.0 (In percent) 20.2 19.5 19.3 12.4 13.4 14.7 Risk-based capital adequacy State-owned banks Domestic private banks Provisions/non erforming loans State-owne banks l!

The mission urged the authorities to take urgent steps to address the deficiencies of the state banks. Last year, performance agreements were signed binding both the banks’ management and the government to measures to improve the commercial viability of the institutions. Apart from loan recoveries, the banks missed the targets set for 1998, which included nonperforming loan ratios, return on capital, staffing costs and branch rationalization. Bank of Ceylon (BOC) was close to achieving several targets, but Peoples Bank was not able to approach the level of performance required. Moreover, international standard portfolio audits indicated that BOC needed to make substantial additional provisioning while Peoples Bank was insolvent.” The mission proposed that the CBSL should introduce new management, close loss-making branches and recapitalize only after fundamental reforms. The ultimate goal should be the privatization of at least one of the banks. The authorities are considering management changes and selling some shares, but they stressed that full bank privatization had been ruled out during.the President’s current term. 27. The mission supported the Central Bank’s move to strengthen regulation (by amending the Banking Act, consolidating supervision of domestic and foreign currency banking units, and imposing foreign exchange exposure limits). The authorities agreed that the current off-site supervision system should be expanded into an effective detection mechanism, and “A fit11 analysis of the current state of banking soundness is given in the 1999 Recent Economic and Policy Developments paper. lSPeoples Bank needed an estimated Rs 11 billion and BOC Rs 1 billion, together equivalent to 1% percent of GDP.

Supervision staf!IIng has been considerably increased and the Banking Act is expected to be a.mended in early 2000 to strengthen further the CBSL’s supervisory powers. It was understood that the CBSL is monitoring closely one private bank that is experiencing problems. The mission recommended the preparation of a contingency plan for corrective action for distressed private banks, including possible budgetary implications. Public Administration and Enterprises 28. Civil service reform has been on the agenda for a long time and progress is being made, albeit at a rather slow pace. The authorities are taking steps to restructure the Ministry of Finance under the guidance of the newly established Management Services Department (MSD). MSD will address all civil service issues, reporting directly to the National Administrative Reform Council, which is headed by the President. However, the sttinoted that the earlier strategy to eliminate 12,000 vacant posts from the authorized cadre for the 1999 budget had not been carried out. The recent recruitment of 8,000 university graduates raised concerns that the government remained the employer of last resort. The authorities explained that, despite this recruitment, total staffing levels were being reduced in 1999 because of retirements. The closure of several statutory boards was welcomed by th.e team, though the problems with labor regulations meant that not all the staff had been retr(enched or transferred. Recognizing that major actions, including staff reductions, could not be carried out this year, the mission urged early preparations to be made for 2000. 29. The focus of pension reform remains to make the civil service system more affordable in the long run and the general public retirement benefits more appropriate. The authorities envisaged a reform program designed to put the civil service system on a fiscally sustainable path and to treat government and nongovernment employees in a similar way. Aided by the World Bank, proposals were being floated to establish a contributory system for new entrants and an “opt-out” policy for existing staff, and to repeal legislation prohibiting the formation of private pension funds. l6 However, the authorities made it clear that no firm plans were decided and that they would cont.inue to seek a consensus. Because of the long-term cost impact of the civil conflict, the authorities plan to review separately military pensions and reflect them in measures of defense spending. 30. Privatization and public enterprise restructuring continue to make progress. The restructuring of Air Lanka, under new management, is going well. Despite some resistance from employees, preparations are underway to convert the Postal Department into a state- owned corporation and a business plan has been formulated, including voluntary separation. The authorities reported that the expected sale of 10% percent of Sri Lanka Telecom (estimated $100 million proceeds) had been delayed but would proceed in the coming months. Although no public announcement is planned, more than 60 enterprises have been earmarked 16The retirement benefits for the general public are inadequate and restrict labor mobility.

The team supported the plans to open up the insurance sector, with the introduction of a new insurance act and divestiture of shares in the state insurance companies. Priority projects for restructuring also include the ports and the power sector. In the case of the ports, a large private investment has been made, but the state-owned company’s restructuring is going slowly. Labor Market 31. The rigidity of the labor market remains a critical constraint on private sector development and timely public sector reform (see Box 2). The team called for a comprehensive overhaul of existing legislation, including the Termination of Employment of Workmen Act, to simplifir the legal requirements and allow enterprises to determine appropriate staffing levels. Procedures for the resolution of labor disputes, including arbitration procedures, need to be strengthened and the implementation of these procedures by the Labor Tribunals and Commissioner of Labor should be speeded up. The authorities responded that amending the legislation is not politically feasible at present. Efforts are underway to streamline the operations of the tribunals. Trade and Capital Account Issues 32. Several steps were taken in 1998 to reduce tariffs and strengthen regional, bilateral and multilateral relations.” The Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ILFTA) was signed in December 1998, and should lead to some immediate tariff removals on imports from India which satisfy the relevant rules of origin, with other cuts phased in over 3 to 8 years. The authorities noted that the implementation of the ILFTA was affected by large lists of excluded items for which discussions are continuing. The authorities remain concerned that regional nontariff barriers are being removed only very slowly, 33. The mission urged the government to carry out in 2000 the introduction of a system of two non-zero tariff bands, as earlier announced. The two-band system should be viewed as a prelude to a reduction in the maximum rate, to be combined with the elimination of the special tariff regime in place for companies covered by the Board of Investment scheme. The mission supported proposals to incorporate the few remaining nonstandard tariffs in excess of 35 percent into the general regime. The authorities noted that they were concerned about the revenue impact of the two-band proposal but intended to press ahead. 34. Some gradual relaxation of Sri Lanka’s broad range of capital account controls should be possible. Foreign investment is not permitted in five sectors and is limited to 40 percent in many others (including banking and insurance), while capital outflows are subject to restrictions. The mission proposed the removal of limits on inward equity and direct r7Sri Lanka’s rating on the Fund’s Index of Trade Restrictiveness is ‘5’-with relatively open tariff (simple average 1 O-l 5 percent) and moderate nontariff barriers (relating to restrictions for wheat and petroleum products).

Unemployment and Labor Market Weaknesses Unemployment has historically been a sensitive issue in Sri Lanka-with two very violent rebellions in 197 1 and 1987-89, in which unemployed youth were the main participants. Unemployment rates among educated youth have always been high (25 percent for those with secondary school qualifications). Although economic growth over the past two decades has reduced the unemployment rate, it remains around 10 percent. A recent World Bank study concluded:’ . The overall unemployment rate falls dramatically to 3% percent when including only those reported as willing to take “any job” (full-time, part-time, self-employed or other). . Unemployment is closely related to household status and availability of income support from elatives, T critical factors in encouraging extended periods of job search. . There is little evidence of a theoretical skills mismatch to explain unemployment. . Substantial labor market segmentation provides a rationale for the unemployed to wait for good jobs. Even excluding nonwage benefits, public sector jobs are, on average, more lucrative (60-100 percent) than private sector jobs. Private sector jobs covered by protective tariffs and the Termination of Employment of Workmen Act also earn premia. . Unemployment rates have no effect on informal sector wages, but do exert downward pressure on formal sector wages. This suggests that the unemployed an2 waiting for good formal sector jobs and are not interested in jobs in the informal sector. Labor market segmentation and the policy environment. Sri Lanka has a highly restrictive labor market regime. Large wage differentials stem from a policy environment that provides protection to certain segments of the economy in the form of stringent job security, tariffs, preferential employment and pay treatment in the public sector. In addition to termination costs, enterprises in the formal private sector face high wages, large contributions for retirement income, and militant trade unions that take adversarial positions often based on political agendas. Informal sector enterprises have little incentive to graduate to the formal sector. As a result, the supply of formal sector jobs is constrained, while the economy cannot realize its maximum productivity. Policy responses of government. Export Processing Zones (EPZs) and Board of Investment (BOB regulations were established providing tax concessions and relief with regard to labor regulations. Unfortunately, most BOI jobs are considered “undesirable” by the educated youth, leading to numerous vacancies in the sector. The government regularly resorts to ad hoc creation of jobs in the public sector, particularly in the teaching corps, public enterprises, and the operation of poverty programs. The Government’s pay policies have also resulted in a highly compressed pay schedule, which has reduced its ability to attract and retain mid- and high-level employees. As a result, Sri Lanka now faces growing weaknesses in governance and public sector management. Challenges for the future. Sir Lanka must improve the supply of good private sector jobs. This requires: (i) trade and market liberalization; (ii) liberalization of labor regulations; and (iii) reform of public sector pay and employment policies. A proper approach for labor regulations would be to provide job and income security to employees without penalizing employers and constraining job generation. From a broader perspective, labor mobility into the private sector will also require improvements in the education system to better equip workers with relevant skills. ‘World Bank, Sri Lanka: A Fresh Lookat Unemployment, August 1999.

OTHER ISSUES 35. Despite the extensive welfare programs, one-fifth of the population still lives below the poverty line, access to sanitation is inadequate, and there are other social and environmental problems. Moreover, the concerns are even greater for those areas in the Northeast region most affected by the civil conflict. There have been recent initiatives to improve access to basic food and clean water for many of the displaced people. The government is reviewing measures to address these issues, with the UNDP, the World Bank and bilateral donors. Educational reform includes improving the job skills of graduates, while health reforms must also address the needs of an aging population. 36. Key economic statistics are supplied to the Fund on a timely basis and the mission welcomed the increased transparency in public finance. Sri Lanka was a pilot participant in the General Data Dissemination System project, The authorities have begun publication of quarterly estimates of GDP and a monthly industrial production index. The Ministry of Finance has recently published Trends in Public Finance 1998, a major step forward in disseminating information, which the mission urged should be supplemented by regular updates. The new format announced for the presentation of the Budget Estimates for 2000 will give a comprehensive analysis of the general government sector, including the provincial councils and public institutions, further enhancing governance and accountability. 37. While making contingency plans, the authorities are confident that Sri Lanka would not face major Y2K problems, except possibly in the health sector where it was proving difficult to trace all suppliers of equipment. The World Bank has funded a specific project to safeguard the financial sector and the revenue departments. The national task force criticized the rating of “3” that had been assigned to Sri Lanka in the Gartner Group’s recent survey. l9 Nobody had visited the country or discussed issues directly with the task force. V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 38. Despite the lingering effects of the Asian crisis and the continuation of the civil conflict, the authorities were able to maintain broad macroeconomic stability in 1998. The principal challenge now is to build on recent progress by resuming fiscal consolidation and establishing a comprehensive program to address the core issues holding the economy back, including the promotion of social consensus. In this context, it is unfortunate that the political ‘*One area would be some limited access to foreign investments for the provident funds as part of their portfolio diversification. ‘?‘here are five tiers of preparedness. The third tier reflects detailed plans, priorities set and risks assessed but not full compliance of all critical items.

For the short term, the critical task is to keep inflation well within single digits and signal a serious commitment to stabilization. This will require a restrained monetary stance, in particular more aggressive open market operations. The staff supports the long-term goal of lowering financial costs by reducing reserve requirements. However, as government borrowing remains above target and inflationary expectations are still high, the staff is concerned that the recent relaxing of monetary conditions will reverse the fall in inflation. For the future, there is a need to target publicly an inflation rate in the low single digit range. Such a move would have to be part of a sufficiently tight fiscal and monetary framework supported by increased central bank independence. This would help end the longstanding negative cycle of price increases and exchange rate depreciation and permanently reduce inflationary expectations. 40. The staff supports the continuation of the managed floating exchange rate policy. But as the rupee has appreciated in real terms in 1999, the central bank should avoid using large scale intervention to resist a depreciation, Some broadening of the exchange rate band could help to give more scope to market forces and to reduce the need for frequent intervention. Moreover, sustained pressure for depreciation of the rupee should be viewed as a warning indicator to tighten monetary policy. 41. To resume fiscal consolidation, and create the conditions for an ambitious budget in 2000, it is important that the projected reduction in the current deficit in 1999 is met. Achieving this improvement will require close vigilance, and the authorities may need to take corrective actions, keeping open the option of raising the national security levy, if needed as a contingency. 42. Increasing public savings and reducing the overall deficit below 7 percent of GDP in 2000 would give credibility to the medium-term objectives of shifting the focus to the private sector and fiscal sustainability. The improvement would also underpin the intended sustained reduction in inflation. It will be necessary to strengthen budgetary performance and structure through a mix of durable revenue and expenditure measures. Given the intended role of GST as the mainstay of domestic taxation, there is a strong case for generating additional revenue by raising the GST tax rate. The elimination of ad hoc exemptions would help to create a broad base. The focus on expenditure should be on protecting key social spending and ensuring that public investment promotes growth and poverty alleviation. Government domestic borrowing should be managed through bond placements in the market at a full range of maturities. International bond issues should not be used to finance the budget deficit given Sri Lanka’s external debt situation. 43. Priority needs to be given to strengthening the financial system and increasing its efftciency. Fundamental reform of the state banks should be initiated without delay, with the government committing more public funds only after serious. restructuring takes place. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- . portfolio audits and failure to meet the performance targets provide an opportunity to push for management changes and rationalization of activities. In the case of Peoples Bank, comprehensive action must be taken to address the problem of its large negative net worth. The aim to sell shares is welcome, even if fir!! privatization is not politically acceptable at this time. Raising the standard of prudential regulations, together with more effective supervision of the banking system, would be an important complement to these efforts. 44. Moving to a higher growth path will require pressing ahead with an ambitious structural agenda to improve the performance of the public sector and enhance prospects for private business. Public administration reform centered on the new Management Services Department should be started as soon as possible. Plans should also be advanced to make the civil service pension scheme more affordable in the long run and the treatment of government and nongovernment employees should be unified to increase labor mobility. 45. The authorities have successfully embarked upon the divestment of key government enterprises, and the staff fully supports the current public enterprise restructuring and privatization program. High priority should be given to restructuring the port and power sectors and opening up the insurance industry. Efforts should continue to eliminate duplication and inefficiencies in the institutions remaining in the public sector, supported by retrenchment schemes. 46. To improve the functioning of the labor market, the staff would urge revision of the procedures for dispute settlement and arbitration, An overhaul of key labor legislation, including the Termination of Employment of Workmen Act, would allow enterprises greater freedom to determine appropriate staffing levels and thereby facilitate job creation. 47. Trade reforms should focus on continuing the shift toward open trade policies and low uniform tariffs. Some liberalization of the capital account controls could take the form of the removal of limits on inward investment and, paripasm with financial sector reform, a phased reduction of restrictions on capital outflows. 48. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 1Zmonth cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - Table 1.

Greater operational independence for the CBSL would facilitate a clearer focus for monetary and exchange rate policy. . Based on the portfolio audits and performance under the MOUs, the authorities must determine what should be done to improve the two state banks. Options to consider include replacing or restructuring their managements, imposing stronger penalties on management for non-performance, closing loss-making branches, reducing staffing, more stringent internal controls, and separation of commercial from government directed activities. . Proposed amendments to the banking law will strengthen the supervisory powers of the CBSL. The authorities should ensure that the new legislation is implemented quickly. . Bank supervision has improved in recent years. However there is still room for improvement in some areas, including on-site supervision, supervision of foreign exchange exposure, and loan provisioning standards. . The draft insurance bill, currently before parliament, should be passed as soon as possibIe, and preparations made to set up an autonomous regulatory authority for the insurance industry once the bill is passed. 2. Civil service . The National Administrative Reform Council (NARC), which includes the President, senior politicians and public servants, and a private sector representative, has a mandate to determine what civil service reforms are necessary and how they will be implemented. Issues for NARC to consider include the organizational structure, staffing levels, salary structure and performance incentives, and entry and exit policies. 3. Pensions . The current unfunded civil service pension scheme will become an increasing drain on the budget as the population continues to age. Options for reform include extending the retirement age, cutting benefits, requiring contributions from existing stat& a contributory scheme for new entrants, and inclusion of existing workers on a voluntary basis. . Steps should be taken to improve the governance and regulation of the private sector provident funds. There is a need to develop the fbnd management capability of the EPF and ETF. To improve private sector retirement options, consideration is being given to opening the provident funds sector to private competition, and allowing the formation of new private pension funds. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - APPENDIX . The market for annuities should also be liberalized to allow provident fUnd beneficiaries the option to convert their lump sum benefits into annuities. 4. Tax administration and expenditure controls . The authorities should prepare and implement plans to reduce GST exemptions to broaden the tax base and increase revenue. . The treasury should continue and enhance recent improvements in cash management and control over the use of lump sum allocations made to government departments. 5. Privatization and public enterprise restructuring . Steady progress is being made in privatization and public enterprise restructuring. Key privatization projects are in the areas of ports, telecommunications, water, sugar production, plantation companies, and insurance. PERC plans to keep the momentum of privatization going by executing at least one large privatization per year. Political considerations, however, dictate a slower pace and more piecemeal approach than would be ideal. 6. Labor markets . The Termination of Employment of Workmen Act is the most important structural barrier in the economy, and its negative impact is present in all sectors. However, amendment or repeal of the Act is politically unlikely. Some progress is possible by improving the efficiency of labor tribunals which arbitrate disputes between management and workers. Four new tribunals have been set up, which should help ease the backlog of over 15,000 unresolved cases, but concerns about efficiency should also be addressed. 7. Trade Regime . To continue the shift towards an open trade regime, the authorities should introduce a system of two non-zero tariff bands in 2000, as previously announced, and eliminate the special tariff regime for companies covered by the Board of Investment scheme. 8. Education and health . The authorities are looking to tackle health problems and reform the education system. Most of the education and health indicators compare well to countries at similar income levels (see Annex VI). However, key issues for reform in the health sector include preparing the system for handling an aging population, determining the f%ture role of public health care, and quality control for private health care. The authorities need to address the challenges of an outdated education system which churns out graduates with few marketable skills and which inadequately contributes to social and ethnic cohesion.

Growth Scenario 1. The principal objectives of the growth scenario, covering up to 2004, are to: (i) raise and maintain annual real growth at 6-7 percent; (ii) reduce inflation to below 4 percent; and (iii) lower the external current account deficit to a level which can be financed on a sustainable basis-while allowing for a comfortable reserve position. 2. The private sector will be the main impetus to sustainable growth, supported by a leaner and more eficient public sector. To attain the objectives, will require bold and decisive public sector reform, with strong measures of fiscal consolidation. The aim would be to achieve a reduction in the overall deficit to around 3% percent of GDP, as well as a turnaround from public dissaving to positive saving equivalent to more than 4 percent of GDP by 2004. Critical factors would be both improvements in revenue performance and reform of the civil service. Adoption of bold reforms of the financial system, pensions, trade, and labor market and legislative procedures will facilitate sustainable private sector growth. 3. The growth target would require an expansion in both private and public investment and, at the same time, an improvement in the efficiency of investment, Public investment is projected to achieve a strong performance of around 8 percent of GDP during the period 2000-04, while private investment is projected to increase to around 22 percent of GDP by 2004 under the impulse of ongoing privatization, raising total investment from 24 percent of GDP in 1997 to 30 percent of GDP in 2004. Key to this positive outcome will be the investment plans already identified in various sectors of the economy, which include telecommunications, ports, and Air Lanka. Foreign investment inflows are also likely to increase as reforms are undertaken. 4. With an expansion in investment, the current account deficit is projected to reach more than 6% percent of GDP in 2000. By the end of the projection period, however, the turnaround in public saving and the increase in private saving will facilitate financing private investment domestically (the investment-domestic savin,g gap will fall from 10 percent of GDP in 2000 to 5 percent of GDP in 2004) while maintaining an investment level of around 30 percent of GDP. These developments will also allow for an improvement in the debt ratio, with the external debt ratio falling to around 45 percent by 2004. 5. Strong export growth is also projected with an increase in intermediate and capital goods imports to stimulate the economy. The current account deficit will fall from Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- ANNEX1 4% percent of GDP in 1999 to less than 2 percent of GDP by 2004 which will accommodate a sufficient level of foreign reserves. (Gross official reserves are projected to reach 4% months of imports by 2004.) Baseline Scenario 6. The Baseline Scenario describes the economic performance assuming a status quo in policy where strong initiatives for fiscal and structural reforms are not fully adopted. In this case, a weaker fiscal adjustment would result in only a gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit to around 7 percent of GDP. Growth would remain near the historical trend rate of 5% percent and inflation (9 percent) would be higher than under the reform scenario. Saving and investment will be lower, reaching less than 22 percent and 28 percent of GDP in 2004, respectively. Current account deficits will continue to be around 4 percent of GDP, reducing the foreign reserve level to around 2% months of imports in 2004-rendering the economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks. Scenario of the Sri Lankan Authorities 7. The projections presented by the authorities were similar to those in the Growth Scenario, but the projection period ended in 2002. In their case, as a result of strenuous fiscal adjustments, the fiscal deficit in 2002 would be just under 5 percent of GDP, almost at the same level as the Growth Scenario. GDP growth could reach 6% percent and inflation would be lowered to 4 percent in 2002. Saving and investment could improve, reaching 23 ‘/z percent and 29% percent of GDP in 2002, respectively, which are more ambitious targets than in the staffs Growth Scenario. The current account deficit could decline to less than 3 percent of GDP in 2002, raising the foreign reserve level to 4 months of imports in 2002.

ANNEX II Sri Lanka--Statistical Issues Staff assessment Overall, the coverage and timeliness of available data in Sri Lanka are adequate. The authorities supply key data to the Fund on a timely basis, the Government regularly publishes economic information and data, and daily information on stock, money, and foreign exchange market developments is readily available through electronic media. However, as noted below, there are deficiencies in the statistical base which, if rectified, would improve the ability to monitor developments and formulate appropriate economic policies. Sri Lanka is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Outstanding statistical issues Sri Lanka produces several consumer price indices. The official price measure--the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPQ-produced by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) uses an outdated consumption basket and weighting system and has become increasingly irrelevant as a measure of general inflation. The DCS also publishes a Greater Colombo Price Index (GCPI), including Colombo city and the suburbs, and is preparing a new CCPI reflecting the results of the 1995/96 Labor Force and Socio-Economic Survey. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) produces a Colombo District CPI (CD-CPI) and a Wholesale cum- Producer Price Index (WPIRPI). A technical assistance report by STA (October 1998) recommended that the official CPI should cover all households (rather than just lower-income ones), and include a reliable price indicator for rent and owner-occupied housing. The authorities should concentrate their resources and expertise to produce a single, high quality official CPI which can serve the needs of all users, and the CPI should be published within three weeks following the collection of price statistics rather than by the last day of the current month. Finally, the need for a wholesale-cum-producer price index should be reviewed, including the linkages to the quarterly national accounts which are being compiled since end- 1998, and the responsibility for publication should be shified from the CBSL to the DCS. Since early 1999, the authorities have begun to publish quarterly national accounts. Consolidated central government data regularly provided for publication in the GFS Yearbook cover the budgetary accounts and three special funds. The authorities are planning to reduce the lag in producing expenditure details to 45 days, and to revise the presentation to conform to GFS standards. They are also beginning to compile current and historical data on the budgetary operations of Provincial Councils. Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) have been reclassified as resident institutions in the monetary survey. Also, there has been a change in the composition of nonresident foreign currency (NRFC) deposits. To adjust for the proportion of these deposits which are actually held by residents (mainly returning migrant workers), 50 percent of these deposits will be reclassified out of foreign liabilities into domestic deposits. The authorities have not yet started reporting to STA the adjusted monetary data for publication in IFS. The reclassification of FCBUs as resident institutions in the monetary survey has led to changes in the net foreign asset position of commercial banks. This reclassification has been reflected in the balance of payments back to 1994. The authorities have already changed the presentation of balance of payments statistics to conform with BPMS. The staff has encouraged the authorities to report quarterly balance of payments data to STA on a regular and timely basis.

Two MIGA guarantees totaling $7 million were approved in FY97-98. During FY89-99, IDA approved 29 credits totaling $1 ,155 million. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Progress Report of January 1999 featured support for macroeconomic and sector reforms to achieve sustained growth, employment, and poverty reduction by promoting private sector-led growth in a manner consistent with the country’s concern for social welfare and equity. The proposed lending program includes a number of relatively high risk, high return operations to address policy issues in health, poverty and rural development, infrastructure (including ports), urban development, and civil service and pensions. The World Bank is also exploring ways to address the underlying causes of the ethnic conflict and create conditions for lasting peace once the war is ended. In FY99, IDA approved a Year 2000 Emergency Assistance project to help the banking system and government agencies. In the future, the World Bank will provide IDA credits and nonlending analysis and advice to help increase agricultural productivity and reduce rural poverty. Assistance is also planned in support of legal reforms to improve the environment for private investment. Support will also be considered to restructure and promote private investment in energy, water and sanitation, ports and environmental management. Support for the social sectors will improve quality, access, financing, and management of education and address health issues raised by an aging population, financing constraints, and declining quality. If the government were to reach agreement on an ESAF, the World Bank would consider supporting reforms in public administration and the financial sector.

The AsDB has also provided technical assistance (TAs) for 16 1 projects, totaling $55.8 million for project preparation and institutional strengthening. In 1998, the AsDB provided four loans for $190 million, and $7.2 million as grant financing for technical assistance. Only one TA for $150,000 was approved in the first half of 1999. Over the medium-term, the AsDB aims to help reduce poverty and achieve sustainable growth by supporting: (i) reforms to promote private sector development and improve public sector management; (ii) human development; (iii) enhancement of infrastructure; (iv) preservation of the natural resource base; and (v) measures to mitigate the social and environmental impact of the transition to a higher growth path. The AsDB’s lending to agriculture (38 percent of total) will continue to support improving productivity and encouraging private sector participation. In the financial and industrial sectors (16 percent of total), lending has focused on assisting the development of the financial sector; supported initiatives to improve the policy and institutional framework, including reducing the role and influence of the state-owned banks; and providing partial credit guarantee for loans from commercial resources. In the energy sector (12 percent of total), the AsDB has provided tinding for generation, transmission, and distribution projects, and an energy sector study was completed in 1998, to assist the Government plan the future direction of the sector and the needed policy reform. On roads and telecommunications (14 percent of total), the AsDB will continue to support developing the capacity of domestic private sector contractors. In the social sector (20 percent of total), lending will support investment in the water and sanitation sectors and promotion of human resource development On the environment, the AsDB will help strengthen natural resource planning, and conservation and sustainable use of renewable resources, particularly in managing coastal environment, water, and forest resources.

Background Over the last decade, Sri Lanka’s economy has grown steadily, but at a relatively slow rate. Underlying this modest performance has been relatively low levels of saving and investment. Prolonged periods of public dissaving have reflected substantial fiscal deficits that averaged more than 10 percent of GDP. During the late 1980s and early 1990s financial markets were liberalized and the outward orientation of the economy was significantly increased and a more diversified export base established. Progress has been made in other areas, most notably privatization. However, less improvement was made in other priority areas including civil service and pensions, state trading monopolies, and financial and labor market reforms. Despite the Asian crisis and the civil conflict, macroeconomic performance was satisfactory in many respects in 1998. Though less than in 1997, real GDP growth was 4% percent, broadly in line with long-run trends. This result was based on good harvests and buoyant domestic demand, including increased investment in the transport, communications, and utilities sectors. Both public and private investment increased in 1998, supported by a faster growth in the construction sector, and foreign direct investment. Higher private, especially corporate, savings pushed the domestic savings ratio to 19 percent, narrowing the savings-investment gap to 2 percent of GDP. Favorable changes in the terms of trade in 1998 contributed to a reduction in import costs and overall inflation. Consumer price inflation declined to 35% percent at end-l 998. Key factors were lower import prices, favorable weather, and adequate food supply. The external current deficit (excluding official transfers) fell to 2 percent of GDP as tea export prices rose sharply and import prices declined significantly. The declining external debt to GDP ratio; reasonable reserve ‘Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4o- ANNEX VII coverage of short-term debt; the high share of concessional external debt; and limited portfolio flows suggest external vulnerability is not high. Nevertheless, the near-term outlook is less encouraging. GDP in the first quarter of 1999 was only 2% percent above the same quarter last year and growth is projected to reach only 3%-4 percent for 1999 because of depressed export markets and weakening private sector activity. After initially depreciating in 1998 in response to the movements of currencies affected by the Asian crisis, the rupee appreciated in real effective terms by over 7 percent in the first half of 1999 and gross official reserves declined to $1.7 billion by July 1999. In periodic attempts to limit the pace of depreciation, the central bank has sold foreign exchange--the commercial bank exchange rates have been at or close to the bottom of the central bank band. The external outlook for the remainder of 1999 is fragile, with the sharp reversal of the terms of trade. Inflation performance was mixed in the first half of 1999. Inflation rose to 7% percent at end-April 1999 on a 12-month basis, before falling to 4% percent in August. Despite the most recent reported slowing of consumer price increases, led by a record harvest and a strong domestic supply of agricultural products, inflationary expectations are generally still high. The overall fiscal deficit rose to 9% percent of GDP in 1998 (compared to an original budget target of 6% percent), reversing the progress achieved over the previous three years. This outcome reflected in equal measure failure to achieve the budgeted cuts in current expenditure (especially on defense), and a shortfall in tax revenue, principally from the goods and services tax (GST). As a result, public savings were sharply negative and domestic bank financing was 2 percentage points of GDP higher than projected. Monetary policy has been constrained by the fiscal situation, requiring high real interest rates to counter exchange rate and inflationary pressures. The decline in the relative contributions to broad money growth of foreign inflows and private sector credit offset the sharp increase in lending to the public sector, a trend maintained through end-June 1999. Real interest rates remain higher than in other countries in the region. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has adjusted downward the overnight repurchase rate on three occasions (from 12.1 percent in September 1998 to 9.5 percent from July 30, 1999). Structural reforms are focussed on current plans to improve the financial sector, public administration and pensions, and trade reform. The banking sector has problems-with large nonperforming loans and low risk-weighted capital adequacy. The CBSL is developing plans for restructuring and management changes in the two state banks and for an enhanced bank supervision framework for the whole commercial bank sector. While privatization and state enterprise restructuring continues, the challenge remains to reform the civil service and pensions systems. Trade reform is focussing on further rationalization of the tariff structure, while moving ahead with regional integration.
