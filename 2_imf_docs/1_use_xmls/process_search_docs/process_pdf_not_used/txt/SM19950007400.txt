Loser and Mark Allen April 12, 1995 I. Introduction A first round of discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation with Canada took place in Ottawa from November 30 to December 12, 1994. Supplementary meetings were held on March 8 and 9, 1995, following the presentation of the 1995 budget. The staff representatives were J. Mdrquez- Ruarte, T. Alleyne, E. Buckberg (EP), E. Nedde, A. Thomas, and C. Towe (all WHD); and L. Bartolini (RES). The staff team met with the Minister of Finance and senior officials of the Department of Finance; the Governor and senior officials of the Bank of Canada; and officials of the Departments of Agriculture, Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Health, Human Resources Development, and Industry. Mr. I. Clark, Executive Director for Canada, and his Advisor, Mr. S. O'Connor, also attended the meetings. The staff report for the last Article IV consultation (SM/94/88, 4/I/94 > and Supplement I, 5/2/94) was considered by the Executive Board on May 4, 1994 (EBM/94/40). On that occasion, Executive Directors noted that the economic expansion in Canada had become well established, but expressed concern over the continued deterioration of the fiscal situation. Although supporting the proposals contained in the February 1994 budget, Directors noted that, even if the Government achieved its interim fiscal consolidation objective, the country's fiscal situation would not improve significantly. Against this background, and because of the unsettling effect that the fiscal situation appeared to be having on exchange and other financial markets, Directors recommended that Canada take advantage of the economic expansion to accelerate fiscal consolidation over the next few years. Directors commended the authorities for their success in reducing inflation and agreed that it was appropriate for them to keep monetary conditions at a level that would continue to accomodate the economic recovery. In light of the unsettled state of financial markets, however, Directors cautioned against actions that might compromise the credibility of the authorities' commitment to price stability.

Economic Develouments and Outlook Canada's recovery from the 1990-91 recession was sluggish at first, but quickened from early 1993 (Table 1 and Chart 1). The recovery was spurred initially by vigorous growth in exports, which drew strength from the U.S. economic expansion and a marked depreciation of the Canadian dollar (se? Chart 1 and Table 2). Growth was held back in 1992 by weak domestic demand, including a sharp contraction in nonresidential construction. During 1993, however, output growth reflected the expansion of domestic demand: invest- ment in machinery and equipment increased strongly; private consumption rebounded somewhat; and there was a large build-up of inventories (see tabulation below).

Surging exports outpaced imports, and strong growth in profits fueled growth in nonresidential fixed investment. Also, a pickup in employment growth and an associated rise in consumer confidence led to a strengthening of private consumption, despite a run-up in interest rates and sluggish growth in personal income. Thus, the saving rate declined sharply from 9.1 percent in 1993 to 7.6 percent in 1994 (Chart 2). Rising interest rates dampened growth in residential investment, and fiscai restraint at all levels of government acted as a brake on demand. The degree of resource utilization increased markedly during 1994 and early 1995. The unemplovment rate fell from 11.2 percent at the end of 1993 to 9.6 percent in February 1995~-by comparison, the natural rate of unemployment is estimated by the staff at 8 to 8 l/2 percent.

The increase in employment in 1994 was largely among full- time workers, whereas in the previous two years part-time worliers accounted for virtually the full increase (Chart 3), and employment rose in the goods- producing sector after four years of decline. Contrary to the normal cyclical pattern, the participation rate continued to decline, reflecting mainly the decision of youths to remain in school and a possible tapering- off in the trend growth of the female participation rate (Chart 4). 1/ The industrial capacitv utilization rate rose from 80.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993 to 84.8 percent a year later. This level was 4 per- centage points above the long-run average, and just 2 percentage points below.the previous cyclical peak (Chart 5). The increase in capacity utilization was especially large for export-related industries, where the utilization rate ~CIS~ to a Level over 2 percentage points above the previous cyclical peak. For the economy as a whole, the staff's estimates of the excess supply gap in the fourth quarter of 1994 are in the neighborhood of 2 to 3 percentage points of potentiaL output. 2/ The slack in labor and product markets has helped to contain inflation despite the depreciation of the Canadian dollar to a nine-year low against the U.S. dollar. During 1994, core CPI inflation (excluding food, energy, and the effect of cuts in tobacco excise taxes) was 1.6 percent, down from 1.8 percent during 1993, while unit Labor costs declined by 1.8 percent, and wage settlements in the private sector provided for annual wage increases averaging 1.1 percent (see Chart 5). However, prices at the industrial level rose by 9.7 percent during the year ended January 1995, the highest such increase in 13 years, and the raw materials price index rose by 18.6 percent. 2/ The external current account deficit fell sharply in the second half of 1994 to 2.7 percent of GDP, from 3.9 percent of GDP in the first half of 1994 and 4.3 percent of GDP in 1993 (Table 3). The large depreciation of the Canadian dollar since 1991, the decline in unit labor costs, and the cyclical recovery in the United States contributed to strong growth in export volume during 1993 and 1994. Import volume growth also accelerated, owing to the large import content of exports (especially automobiles) and investment: goods. The capital account was bolstered in 1993 by large inflows of portfolio investment, but during 1994 net capital inflows declined markedly as nonresidents' investment in federal and provincial bonds dropped off sharply. Net foreign liabilities rose from an average of about 35 percent of GDP during the mid-1980s to 46 percent of GDP in 1994. I/ This issue is explored in further detail in the background papers. Z2/ The Okun coefficient in Canada is estimated at about 2.3. Estimates of potential output are reviewed in the background papers. 3/ It should be noted that the increase in industrial prices was driven primarily by increases in the prices of exported goods, and that the correlation between consumer prices and industrial prices is not robust.

The output gap is projected to nearly close by the end of 1996, and real GDP growth would average 2.8 percent during 1997-2000 as compared to potential GDP growth of 2.6 percent. The unemployment rate would fall gradually to its natural rate, and core inflation would decline to 1 L/2 percent a year. The current account deficit is projected to fall from 3.3 percent of GDP in 1994 to 2.0 percent of GDP in 1995 and 1.2 percent of GDP in 2000. This decline would reflect continued improvement in the merchandise trade balance owing to the effect of the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar.

Such a shift could cause exchange market pressures and increase interest rate differentials vis-B-vis the United States, worsening the fiscal situation and the prospects for Canadian growth. 1/ A second risk relates to the assumption that a "soft Landing" is achieved in both the United States and Canada. In the case of Canada, real interest rates are relatively high, and it is possible that the economy will slow more abruptly than projected. In the case of the United states, while the projections assume that economic activity will slow toward potential without a substantial further increase in short-term interest rates, there is a risk that larger increases will be needed and that more severe economic slowdown may result. These risks are balanced, to some extent, by the possibility that investor sentiment toward Canadian dollar assets could strengthen in view of the economy's relatively strong output 1,' The Department of Finance estimates that a sustained 100 basis-point decline in interest rates would reduce the fiscal deficit by $3.6 billion in the fourth year.

III. Policy Issues Since coming into office in November 1993, the Government has empha- sized the creation of jobs and economic growth as its main policy objectives. To this end, it has reaffirmed the importance of a low- inflation environment in promoting growth, and it has taken steps toward labor market reform in order to reduce Canada's high rate of structural unemployment. The Government has stressed that the large federal budget deficit and debt are major obstacles to economic growth, and has committed itself to a program of fiscal consolidation that has focused on reducing the deficit from 5.6 percent of GDP in fiscal year 1993/94 (April to March) to 3 percent of GDP by 1996/97. Canada's economic performance has improved in important respects in the past 12 months. Economic growth has been strong and unemployment has fallen markedly, while inflation has remained quite low. The federal budget deficit has declined owing to adjustment measures as well as cyclical factors. However, a large fiscal imbalance remains, and pressures in financial markets underscore the vulnerability of the country's fiscal position and the need for strong efforts to bolster the credibility of the authorities' commitment to fiscal consolidation and price stability. a. Fiscal wlicv Despite a decade of fiscal consolidation programs at the federal level, Canada's fiscal problem remains serious. General government net debt reached almost 100 percent of GDP at end-1994 (Table 4), a level exceeded only by Italy among the G-7 countries. 1/ The vulnerability that this level of indebtedness implies is exacerbated by the fact that over 40 percent of federal government securities have a maturity of one year or less and that just aver 25 percent is held by nonresidents. Moreover, public Sector indebtedness is considerably higher when account is taken of the future funding requirements of Canada's public pension system. 2J Uneasiness about Canada's fiscal situation has led to a downgrading of Canadian debt by debt rating agencies. It also has contributed to frequent episodes of turbulence in Canadian exchange and financial markets and large 1/ The net debt figure referred to above is defined on a "public accounts" basis, which excludes the assets held by public employee pension plans and the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans.

Instead, the Government has focused on an interim target of reducing the budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 1996/97. In order to meet this target, last year's budget contained measures expected to yield l/4 percent of GDP in 1994/95 and 1 l/2 percent of GDP once fully phased-in in 1996/97. Measures included an extension of a freeze on public sector salaries; cuts in unemployment insurance benefits; limits on transfers to provinces; and cuts i.n defense spending, business subsidies, and operating costs. On the revenue side, the tax base was broadened somewhat by eliminating or reducing tax deductions and credits. The Government also started a number of program reviews--notably for unemployment insurance, social security, and government operations--in order to formulate changes consistent with social and fiscal policy objectives. As noted, the Article IV consultation discussions were held in two rounds, the first in December 1994 during the early stages of preparation of the 1995/96 budget. During a second round of discussions in March 1995, the mission reviewed the budget presented to the Parliament in February. The December 1994 discussions focused on the magnitude and content of the adjustment measures that ought to be included in the 1995/96 budget. The mission advanced the view that a fiscal package that aimed simply toward bringing the deficit to about 3 percent of GDP in 1996/97 would imply an unduly slow pace of adjustment, leaving the fiscal position very vulnerable to cyclical or interest rate shocks. The economic expansion was already relatively mature by historical standards, and a downturn could derail the fiscal consolidation effort and cause the debt ratio to increase. The mission recalled that the slackening of adjustment efforts during th'e 1987-88 period of rapid expansion was a major reason for the previous Government's failure to correct the fiscal problem. 2/ Against this background, the mission stressed the need to take advantage of the robust economic expansion under way to put in place a front-loaded package of adjustment measures. The mission proposed accelerating the pace of adjustment through the adoption of new measures that would reduce the deficit by 2 percentage points of GDP, including interest savings, to about 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1996/97.

I/ Apart from putting the debt/GDP ratio on a firm downward path and strengthening financial market confidence, an adjustment program of this magnitude would lead to an increase in national saving and a decline in real interest rates, raising capital formation and potential output. It also could enhance the credibility of the authorities' commitment to price stability by facilitating the slowdown of aggregate demand to sustainable levels and thereby helping to prevent the emergence of excess demand pressures with the least adverse effect on productive investment. 2,' The mission prepared a detailed list of fiscal options that were consistent with its proposed adjustment (Appendix III). The list favored reductions in outlays and tax expenditures because increases in marginal tax rates could exacerbate the problem of tax evasion and adversely affect economic efficiency and international competitiveness. J/ Cuts were encouraged in areas where government action had contributed to distortions in resource allocation and areas where social assistance was not suffi- ciently means-tested, such as elderly benefits. For example, the system of federal-provincial transfers, which includes funding for health, post-secondary education, and social welfare programs, appeared to have led to overly generous provincial programs. Reform of the unemployment insurance (UI) system was needed to ensure that it provided only short-term, basic income maintenance, in order to reduce its use as a long-term welfare system and its detrimental effect on employment. Cuts in government subsidies to business (including the Crown corporations) seemed appropriate given their likely adverse effect on the economy's potential output. In the agricultural area, federal transfers in the form of direct subsidies, income support, and subsidies for transportation of agricultural commodities tended to encourage inefficient production. During the December discussions, the Canadian representatives generally agreed with the need to address the areas identified by the mission. While they expected that the 1995/96 budget would contain measures in most of those areas, they doubted that the size of the adjustment would be large I/ Since the December mission, the fiscal outlook, excluding the effect of the policies in the 1995 budget, worsened by about 0.7 percent of GDP because of a rise in the projected path of interest rates. 2/ On the basis of simulations done with MULTIMOD, a fiscal consolidation package similar to the one outlined above would reduce output by an average of 0.2 percent of baseline GDP for the first two years. However, both actual and potential output then would rise (led by increases in investment and net exports), exceeding baseline levels by 3/4 percent by the sixth year. See the background papers for further details. J/ Personal income tax receipts (including social insurance contri- butions) are roughly the same in Canada and the United States, while indirect tax payments are nearly 7 percentage points higher in Canada.

Nonetheless, in order to meet the 3 percent deficit target within the prescribed time period, deep structural changes would be made in the size and direction of government programs and in relations between the Federal Government and the provinces. Undoubtedly, these changes would put the budget deficit on a downward track beyond 1996/97. The Canadian representatives also questioned the usefulness of setting a timetable for meeting the long-term goal of a balanced budget. After the recurrent failure of the previous Government to meet fiscal objectives, credibility was best re-established by meeting a series of short-term targets. The budget presented to Parliament on February 27, 1995 introduced measures whose yield was estimated to rise to about 1 l/4 percent of GDP in 1996/97, sufficient to achieve the interim deficit/GDP target of 3 percent (Tables 5 and 6). The staff projections, which a&based on slightly more favorable macroeconomic assumptions, portray a similar fiscal outlook through 1996/97. While the budget did not provide fiscal projections beyond 1996/97, the staff estimates that the deficit would fall to 2 percent of GDP by the end of the century (see following tabulation, Table 7, and Chart 6).

Revenue measures, comprising about 12 percent of the fiscal package, included higher corporate tax rates, and increases in gasoline and tobacco excise taxes. The budget eliminated grain transportation subsidies and other regional transportation subsidies. Also, dairy subsidies, subsidies to industry, contributions to farm income stabilization programs, and subsidies to cultural programs were sharply reduced. In a concerted effort to improve cost recovery for many of its services, the Government announced plans to commercialize the air navigation system, convert regional development grants into loan programs, introduce a fee for nzw immigrants, and raise user fees. The budget contained plans to scale back most'spending programs. especially those that were in the constitutional domain of the provinces (such as inland water and forestry management) or where a duplication of services existed with other levels of government or the private sector (such as regional development). In addition, the Government announced further cuts in defense spending and plans to privatize two Crown corporations. The scaling back of programs also "as to be accompanied by a reduction in operating costs. In particular, federal civil service employment was projected to decline by 45,000 (roughly 15 percent of 1994/95 levels), with a cut of about 20,000 positions taking place by the summer of 1996. The budget also included an important change to the system of federal- provincial transfers. Beginning in 1996/97, transfers under the Canada Assistance Plan, which funds provincial social welfare programs on a shared- cost basis, are to be merged with the transfers provided under the Established Programs Financing system, which provides block grants to fund provincial post-secondary education and health programs. The consolidated transfer, the Canada Social Transfer (CST), would be provided as a block grant, increasing the provinces' flexibility in the use of the funds. Funding for the combined transfer was reduced by $2.5 billion and $4.5 bil- lion in 1996/97 and 1997/98, respectively, compared to baseline levels. In discussions with the Canadian authorities in March, the Fund mission endorsed the budget as a significant effort. However, the mission reiterated its view that attaining the 3 percent target still would leave the federal finances under stress, with the debt/GDP ratio declining only slowly from a very high level. The persistence of a large deficit and a high debt/GDP ratio for a number of years, even in the face of adjustment measures ( would weaken the credibility of fiscal policy with adverse consequences in financial markets. The mission noted that the current strength of the economic expansion provided the appropriate environment in which to take further action to address the fiscal problem in a more fundamental way. The Canadian representatives stressed that the fiscal outcome "as likely to be better than projected owing to the deliberate adoption of very conservative economic and technical assumptions.

Nonetheless, they cautioned that the scope for substantial additional spending cuts was now limited, particularly in view of the adverse effects that such cuts could have on the provinces' deficit-reduction efforts. On the revenue side, the Canadian representatives noted that an important assumption underlying the longer term budget outlook was an assumed decline in the revenue/GDP ratio, in turn related to the projected decline in the UI premium. Under current legislation, the UI premium was expected to remain et its current level through 1996, in order to allow a surplus to be built up in the UI account and avoid the need for increases in UI premiums during the next economic downturn. Thereafter, however, the premium rate would decline to a level that would equate UI revenues with UI expenditures, reducing revenues by as much es l/2 percent of GDP. u Therefore, a major decision looming for policymakers was what to do about the projected decline in the UI premium after 1996. The Canadian representatives stated that the country's fiscal situation would make it difficult to give up such a large amount of revenue. One option would be to amend the legislation governing the UI account in order to prevent a sharp drop in the premium rate. An alternative would be to increase the Canadian Pension Plan (CPP) contribution rates by the amount of the decline in the UI premium rate. The latter option would not help the federal deficit--since the CPP's account was off-budget--but it would assist in redressing the CPP's large unfunded liability. While supporting the intention to conserve revenues and strengthen the CPP, the mission noted that less distortionary means than payroll taxes. such as an increase in the Goods and Services Tax. also should be considered. An important element in the Canadian fiscal problem was the large fiscal deficits of the provinces. The Canadian representatives noted that in recent years mo.st of the provinces had adopted credible and substantial medium-term fiscal adjustment programs, which had contributed to a decline in their aggregate deficit from 2.7 percent of GDP in 1993/94 to 2.2 percent of GDP in 1994/95. ZJ With the exception of Quebec and Ontario, the provinces were on track to achieve balanced budgets by 1996/97, which would bring the overall provincial deficit for 1996/97 to about I percent of GDP. While the large fiscal deficits in Ontario and Quebec were a concern, their fiscal consolidation efforts were expected to intensify following the referendum in Quebec on the sovereignty issue and the general election in Ontario, which were fo take place in late 1995. The Canadian representatives acknowledged that expenditure cuts at the federal level tended to affect the provinces' fiscal situation adversely in the short term.

The Federal Government had provided the provinces with substantial advance notice of changes to the level of transfers, thus allowing the provinces to make an orderly adjustment. b. Monetarv uolicv and the exchanpe rate Monetary policy continues to be directed toward achieving the goal of price stability. In December 1993, the new Government and the Bank of Canada reaffirmed this commitment and extended through end-1998 the inflation target range of 1 to 3 percent originally set for end-1995. Canada has a floating exchange rate regime. The authorities intervene in the foreign exchange market in a symmetric manner to moderate exchange rate movements, but do not seek to stabilize the exchange rate at any given level. The Bank of Canada generally responds to abrupt exchange rate movements, so as avoid confusion about monetary policy objectives and contain spillovers to other financial markets. With the marked decline in inflation in recent years, the Bank of Canada generally sought to ease interest rates from mid-1990 to early 1994. As the spread between Canadian and U.S. short-term interest narrowed (Chart 7), the Canadian dollar depreciated by 18 percent against the U.S. dollar between October 1991 and the end of 1993. Interest rates bottomed out in February 1994, when the Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy in the United States. Since then, Canadian short-term rates have risen by 470 basis points and long-term rates have increased by 220 basis points. The spread between Canadian and U.S. short-term interest rates has increased from 40 basis points to 240 basis points, while the long-term differential has increased from 70 basis points to 140 basis points. Since January 1994 the Canadian dollar has depreciated by a further 5 percent against the U.S. dollar. In real effective terms, the Canadian dollar depreciated by 23 percent from its peak in October 1991 to February 1995. The monetary conditions index (MCI), which captures movements in both interest rates and exchange rates, declined sharply from mid-1990 through the first quarter of 1994, and remained relatively stable through late 1994. The broader MZ-plus aggregate, which historically has contained useful information about future inflation, rose by 2.1 percent during 1994, compared with 3.4 percent a year earlier, a level which is regarded as consistent with low inflation. The growth of gross Ml declined from 11.4 percent during 1993 to 7.0 percent during 1994, while household and business credit strengthened during 1994 (Chart 8). 1/ u Real Ml is considered a leading indicator of real GDP, See the background papers for a description of the MCI and a discussion of the informational content of the monetary aggregates.

The focus on these unfavorable aspects of the Canadian situation has heightened during the past 14 months, producing two episodes of sharp declines in the external value of the Canadian dollar and sharp increases in interest rates: during the period February-June 1994, following the increase in U.S. interest rates; and again during December 1994 and January 1995, triggered by expectations of another round of tightening by the Federal Reserve and by the Mexican currency crisis (Chart 9). The Bank of Canada representatives explained that in late 1994 the Bank attempted to moderate increases in Canadian short-term rates in the face of rising U.S. rates, on the basis that a narrowing of interest-rate differentials was consistent with Canada's lower inflation and excess supply conditions. Unfortunately, the Bank's actions seemed to have been perceived by markets as signalling a lack of concern about the exchange rate and contributed to substantial downward pressure on the Canadian dollar, which was exacerbated by the Mexican currency crisis and the continued focus on Canada's fiscal situation. As a result, sharp increases in short-term interest rates were required TV stabilize the exchange rate. The mission suggested that, given the robust pace of the economic expansion and the lags in the effect of monetary actions, it would soon be time to consider the need for a shift in monetary policy to a less accommo- dative stance. The MCI had bottomed out in the first quarter of 1994 and increased somewhat since, but still was close to historical lows. The Canadian representatives saw no need for further significant adjustments in the stance of monetary policy after the increase in interest rates that had taken place from December 1994 to March 1995. While the economy had grown rapidly in 1994, inflation remained quite low, and the currently high level of real interest rates and fiscal consolidation programs at the federal and provincial level would help slow growth in 1995 and beyond. In the view of the Canadian representatives, inflation could be kept in the lower half of the official 1 to 3 percent target range once the full effects of the depreciation had passed through. However, they agreed that the Bank had to remain vigilant and adjust monetary conditions well ahead of the emergence of inflationary pressures. They noted that in the past, at this stage in the economic expansion, most analysts had underestimated how much momentum existed in the economy and had overestimated the amount of economic slack. The Canadian representatives also noted that nearly all of the decline in the MCI during the past two years had been attributable to the depreciation of the Canadian dollar. This mix of monetary conditions--high real interest ratzs and a depreciated dollar--resulted in a pattern of growth skewed towards the external sector; a mix consisting of a stronger currency and lower interest rates would lead to more balanced growth. The Canadian representatives remarked that, on the basis of historical relation- ships, the Canadian dollar was quite undervalued relative to long-term trends, particularly if the recent high level of world commodity prices were Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public20 to persist. An appreciation of the Canadian dollar would provide a propitious environment for a narrowing of interest rate differentials vis-B- vis the United States and a decline in domestic interest rates, as would 'be warranted by Canada's superior inflation performance. c. Structural issues In the 1994 budget, the Government committed itself to a wide ranging reform of social programs, including the unemployment insurance system, social welfare, post-secondary education, and elderly benefits. While the Government had outlined in 1994 various proposals for the reform of the social assistance and post-secondary education systems, the 1995 budget opted instead to provide the provinces with block-grant funding in order to give them greater flexibility in determining their own policies. For unemployment insurance and elderly benefits, the reform process is still in its early stages. Health care reform is proceeding at the provincial level, as those governments attempt to curb the rapid growth of health care spending. In the area of tax reform, the Federal Government and the provinces are negotiating a replacement for the federal value-added tax, the Goods and Services tax (GST). In the financial sector, the Department of Finance recently published a proposal to enhance the safety and soundness of the financial system. In the trade area, Canada has ratified the Uruguay Round Agreement and is seeking to extend NAFTA to other countries. Among the causes often cited by analysts as contributing to the high rate of structural unemployment in Canada is the generosity of the unemploy- ment insurance system. In the 1994 budget, the Government took steps to deal with this problem by linking benefits more closely to the length of time in employment and reducing the maximum number of weeks of III eligibility. The Government also announced initiatives aimed at reducing youth unemployment, including a youth service corps and a youth apprentice- ship program. A discussion paper was issued in October 1994 that outlined possible options for UI reform. The specific features of the reform are still being considered, but the 1995 budget specified that the size of the UI program would be reduced by a minimum of 10 percent, which would yield savings of $700 million in 1996/97. The reform of the public system of benefits for the elderly is likely to be driven in large part by the need to reduce the system's costs. 'The system comprises the CPP, a pay-as-you-go program funded entirely by contributions from workers and their employers and from interest on the accumulated reserves, and the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Old Age Security (OAS) transfer, an income-support program for the elderly that is financed out of general revenues. The Canadian representatives noted that under the existing system of benefits, the financial sustainability of the CPP will require a 130 percent increase in the contribution rate over the next 20 years. With respect to the OAS, there was a need to establish stricter means-testing standards, since individuals earning as much as $80,000 per year were still entitled to some (albeit reduced) OAS benefits.

An important part of the provincial fiscal consolidation effort has been health care reform, which has allowed provinces to reduce the growth of health-care spending from an average annual rate of 9 percent during the 1987-91 period to a rate of just 1 percent during the 1992-94 period. u The Government recently has launched a National Forum on Health, to promote a national dialogue on reforms to the health system. In the area of tax reform, the Federal Government has been negotiating with the provinces on the features of a new value-added tax, to replace the GST, which could involve either harmonization with or replacement of existing provincial sales taxes. 2/ Harmonization would improve the economic efficiency of the indirect tax system by shifting the incidence of provincial taxes away from intermediate inputs to consumption. It would also permit a reduction in the costs of compliance and tax administration. Comprehensive financial reform legislation was passed in 1992 that narrowed the differences among financial institutions by allowing them to offer most kinds of financial services either directly or indirectly. In February 1995, the Government presented a plan to enhance the safety and soundness of the financial system. The main features of the proposed reform would include a legislated mandate for the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) providing for prompt action (including closure) to deal with problem institutions, greater disclosure of financial data, changes to the deposit insurance system that included risk-based premiums, better protection of policyholders of life and health insurance companies, and initiatives to reduce systemic risk in major clearing and settlement systems. The Canadian representatives identified three main objectives of Canadian trade policy: the reducrion or elimination of trade barriers to Canadian exports by expanding WTO membership, broadening NAFTA, and proceeding with bilateral negotiations; the effective management of U.S.- Canadian trade relations; and the creation of an effective WI'0 with an emphasis on dispute settlement and completion of a services agreement. The Canadian Parliament passed legislation making the Uruguay Round Agreement effective January 1, 1995, although it will not implement the Agreement's agricultural provisions until the new marketing year begins on August 1.

The Canadian representatives noted that aggregate subsidy levels were already adequately low to meet the Uruguay Round Agreement's criteria, and that further reductions would not be required. 1/ The Canadian representatives viewed the implementation of NAFTA as satisfactory, although no disputes had yet been taken before panels and thus the dispute-settlement mechanism could not be evaluated. Trilateral committees were working to develop an alternative system to handle anti- dumping and countervail among NAFTA countries. Also, Canada was actively seeking to expand NAFTA, and negotiations have been announced for the accession of Chile and creation of a hemispheric free-trade zone by 2005. Canada also was a signatory to the November 1994 agreement on Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation, which envisaged the creation of a Pacific free trade and investment zone by 2020. In the area of Official Development Assistance (ODA), the Canadian representatives noted that a parliamentary committee had reaffirmed Canada's policy of focussing its aid program on poverty reduction and basic human needs. The committee also had called for reducing the proportion of tied aid and targeting aid to a narrower range of countries. Although the Government still kept its long-term commitment to an ODA/GNP ratio of 0.7 percent, the current climate of fiscal austerity Is expected to lead to a decline in international assistance from 0.35 percent of GDP in 1994/95 to 0.23 percent of GDP in 1997/98. IV. Staff AuDraisal Canada's current economic situation presents both favorable elements and considerable risks. Economic growth has been very strong, inflation is low, and the unemployment rate has fallen markedly. However, these economic gains may not last for long unless the federal fiscal position is strengthened and the rate of expansicn of aggregate demand is brought down to the rate of potential output growth. Capital formation also needs to be supported by encouraging national saving and phasing out distortions that impair resource allocation. The measures adopted in the February 1995 budget constitute a significant step toward correcting the federal budget imbalance. If the 1/ Additional commitments under the Agreement include the elimination of tariffs in specified sectors and the reduction of remaining tariffs by 40 percent in five to ten years; the expansion of intellectual property rights protection; and revision of rules governing antidumping and countervail. Canada also is undertaking a review of its import tariff regime with a view to making the system simpler, more transparent to users, and easier to administer.

In order to achieve this outcome. however, it will be critical that the authorities adhere to their commitment to curb the growth of spending. This will require a resolute implementation of the budgeted downsizing of the civil service, as well as ensuring that a broad range of regional spending programs are reduced and eliminated as planned. Even with the budget measures, however, the public finances will remain under considerable stress. The debt/GDP ratio would continue to be extremely high at about 70 percent, while interest payments would be the equivalent of one third of government revenue, making the budget highly vulnerable to interest rate shocks or an economic downturn. The persistence of high deficits and debt levels, even in the face of adjustment measures, could undermine confidence in the Government's economic policies and lead to sharply higher interest rates and downward pressure on the Canadian dollar. Government debt would continue to rise, and ultimately more strenuous efforts would be required to deal with a worsened fiscal situation in an environment of public skepticism. In these circumstances, a more fundamental correction of the fiscal situation seems warranted. A package of additional measures leading to a more rapid balancing of the budget would go a long way toward meeting the economic challenges outlined above. Such a package would put the debt/GDP ratio and the interest burden on a declining path, strengthen market confidence, and alleviate pressures on interest rates. It would also help to moderate the expansion of aggregate demand, raise the credibility of the authorities' commitment to price stability, and ease the task of monetary policy. Finally, it would strengthen the national saving performance, releasing resources for domestic investment or foreign debt reduction, and raising living standards in the long term. During the December discussions, the staff delivered to the authorities a detailed list of the measures that could be considered to achieve fiscal adjustment. The February 1995 budget took measures in many of the areas identified in that list, but action still is required in a number of important areas. Reforms are needed in the unemployment insurance system so that it provides short-term, basic income support but does not discourage job search. Further cuts in business and agricultural subsidies would reduce the deficit while improving resource allocation, and reforms of the system of benefits to the elderly are necessary to improve equity while yielding fiscal savings. Important steps have been taken toward simplifying the system of federal-provincial transfers, but uncertainty remains regarding the mechanisms that will govern the growth and distribution of transfers beyond 1996/97. With the projected decline in the UI premium, the federal revenue/GDP ratio is expected to fall, and additional action will be required to maintain federal revenues. While the scope for increases in personal and corporate tax rates may be limited, the base of direct and indir-ect tax systems could be broadened considerably by eliminating or reducing tax Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public24 exemptions. The staff also supports efforts to harmonize the GST with provincial sales taxes. Fiscal adjustment also is needed beyond the Federal Government. While most provinces have begun to adjust, additional action is still required, particularly in Ontario and Quebec. In addition, the public pension system represents a substantial unfunded liability of the government, and there is a clear need to address the situation by either an increase in funding or a decrease in benefits. The projected decline in the UI premium provides room for raising pension contribution rates. However, payroll taxes tend to be distortionary, and consideration could be given to developing more efficient revenue sources and to phasing in an increase in the age of entitlement. The reduction of the rate of inflation to very low levels is a praise- worthy achievement. The challenge for the future is to preserve a favorable price performance even as unemployed resources are absorbed, thus allowing the long-term productivity gains arising from low inflation to be realized. The recent increase in interest rates, although aimed at subduing pressures in foreign exchange markets, also responded to the need to slow the growth of aggregate demand to rates that would ensure a continuation of low inflation. However, vigilance will be required, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding the measurement of economic slack and the underlying strength of domestic demand. With the substantial depreciation of the Canadian dollar that has taken place in recent years, and the benefits of structural reform and low inflation, external competitiveness has risen considerably, and the external current account has shown definite signs of improvement. Although further exchange market pressures cannot be ruled out, it is to be hoped that a resolution of fiscal and political difficulties will permit a strengthening of the Canadian dollar and allow the economy's good fundamentals, in particular the excellent price performance, to show through in a narrowing of interest rate differentials vis-8.vis the United States and a fall in real interest rates. The implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreement will provide the opportunity to phase out long-standing distortions in trade and agriculture. In particular, the supply-management system for certain agricultural com- modities constitutes a major impediment to efficient resource allocation and results in unreasonably high prices for Ganadian consumers. Import quotas on those commodities are being replaced by tariffs at prohibitive levels in line with the letter but not the spirit of the Uruguay Round. Cutting tariffs to levels that permit genuine access would improve resource allocation and reduce prices for consumers, while raising tax revenue. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Canada be held on the standard 12.month cycle.

Forecast summary The staff's economic Droiections envisage that real.GDP growth will decelerate from 5.6 percent during 199LI to 3.2 percent during 1995 and 2.5 percent during 1996 (fourth quarter over fourth quarter), as projected high real interest rates and fiscal consolidation restrain domestic demand growth and an assumed slowdown in the United States slows the growth of net exports (see attached table). Over the 1997-2000 period, the output gap is virtually eliminated as real GDP growth is projected to average 2.8 percent, compared with potential GDP growth of 2.6 percent. The unemployment rate is expected to decline gradually from its current level of 9.6 percent to 8.4 percent in 2000. Consumer Drice inflation is expected to rise to 2.3 percent during 1995, and then to gradually decline to 1.5 percent by the end of the projection period. The current account deficit is projected to fall from 3.3 percent of GDP in 1994 to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2000 owing to a large increase in the merchandise trade surplus. 2. Main assumutions Real GDP erowth in the United States is expected to decline from 4.1 percent in 1994 to 3.2 percent in 1995 and 1.9 percent in 1996 before rising back to its potential rate of 2.4 percent in the medium term. The Federal Reserve is expected to continue tightening monetary conditions this ye==, resulting in an increase in the 3-month treasury bill rate from its current level of 6.0 percent to 6.5 percent by the third quarter of 1995, after which it is assumed to remain constant. m-y policy in Canada will keep inflation below the midpoint of the 1-3 percent official target range. Consistent with this, and also with the path of U.S. interest rates, the 3.month Canadian treasury bill rate is assumed to remain constant at 8 percent during 1995, decline to 7.3 percent during 1996, and remain at that level thereafter. Fiscal uolicv in Canada, based on the 1995 federal budget and the 1994 provincial budgets, is assumed to be restrictive at both levels of Government for the entire projection period, resulting in a reduction of the general government deficit from 5.3 percent of GDP in 1994 to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2000 (national income accounts basis). This projection is consistent with the federal deficit falling from 5.8 percent of GDP in FY 1993/94 to 1.9 percent of GDP in Fy 1999/2000 (public accounts basis). 3. Domestic demand The growth of domestic demand is expected to slow beginning in the second half of 1995. Personal consumption growth is expected to moderate during 1995, owing to continued weak income growth and high real interest rates. Government expenditure on goods and services will be a drag on demand throughout the entire projection period as a result of fiscal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX II consolidation. Residential investment is expected to remain weak in 1995 on account of high interest rates, but is expected to gain strength in 1996 as interest rates decline. Business investment is projected to show strong growth in both 1995 and 1996, spurred by strong corporate profits and the need to increase capacity in the export sector. In the medium term, personal consumption should grow in line with real disposable income, and investment is projected to grow faster than GDP, consistent with maintaining the long-term capital/output ratio of the economy. 4. External sector The current account deficit is expected to fall from 3.3 percent of GDP in 1994 to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2000 owing to a steady rise in the merchandise trade surplus which offsets a worsening of the invisibles deficit caused by a growing net investment income deficit. The factors underlying the rise in the merchandise trade surplus are an increase in world commodity prices and continued growth in the volume of manufacturing exports in response to a sustained expansion in the United States and lasting gains in competitiveness. 5. Prices and interest rates The presence of economic slack throughout virtually the entire projection period is expected to put downward pressure on inflation. In 1995, there is a one-time upward adjustment in the price level because of the lagged pass-through effects of Canada's prolonged currency depreciation and the effect of the increases in gasoline and tobacco excise taxes announced in the 1995 budget. The projections assume that the differential between Canadian and U.S. short-term interest rates declines through 1995 and 1996 and remains constant at 75 basis points thereafter, This assumption is consistent with the different cyclical positions of the two economies, Canada's projected superior inflation performance, and the maintenance of a risk premium on Canadian dollar-denominated securities based on Canada's projected unresolved fiscal problem. Low inflation expectations are expected to lead to a decline in long-term rate.s in Canada that is consistent with the decline in U.S. long-term rates. Specifically, the lo-year government bond yield is assumed to fall from 8.9 percent in the first quarter of 1995 to 8.2 percent by the middle of 1996, and remain constant thereafter. 6. &inz and investment In the forecast, investment increases from 18.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to 21.4 percent of GDP in 2000, with private investment rising from 16.2 percent of GDP to 19.4 percent of G3P. The rise in investment is financed by an increase in public and private savings of 3.6 percent of GDP and 1.5 percent of GDP respectively, and is consistent with the projected narrowing of the external current account deficit.

Risks to the forecasts As outlined in the staff report, the main uncertainty associated with the staff projection pertains to the reaction of financial markets to the Government's fiscal policy initiatives. The baseline assumes that the risk premium on Canadian dollar securities declines relatively slowly, resulting in a continued positive spread between Canadian and U.S. interest rates, despite the excess supply conditions and lower inflation in Canada.
