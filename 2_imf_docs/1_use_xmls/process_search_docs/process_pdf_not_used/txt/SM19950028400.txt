Introduction and Recent Economic Develouments The staff report (SM/94/191) for the last Article IV consultation discussions (held during the period April 25-May 9, 1994) was discussed by the Executive Board on August 26. 1994. At that time, Executive Directors, while noting Mauritius's past success in economic management, stated that the completion of the Uruguay Round provided Mauritius with important new opportunities and challenges. In this context, they stressed that the most urgent macroeconomic task was to bring inflation down, and called for tightened fiscal and monetary policies. . Information on recent economic developments obtained during the course of the 1995 Article IV consultation mission is summarized in the basic data (Table 1 and in Chart 1). lJu The Mauritian economy grew by an estimated 4.1 percent in 1994/95, slightly lower than in the previous year (Table 2). Real GDP growth dropped largely on account of the impact of Cyclone Hollanda as well as drought conditions (particularly in the agricultural sector). The cyclone also caused disruptions to production schedules in the manufacturing sector. Inflation eased in 1994/95, averaging 6.1 percent for the year as a whole, down from 9.4 percent in 1993/94. However, underlying inflation may have been higher, reflecting u The consultation discussions were held in Port Louis during the period July 20-August 3, 1995, with the Honorable R. Sithanen (Minister of Finance), Sir Indur Ramphul (Governor of the Bank of Mauritius), as well as with government officials concerned with economic and financial matters, and with representatives of the private sector. The staff representatives (all AFR) were Messrs. Cyril Enweze (head), R. A. Franks, and J. Toujas-Bernate, Ms. J. Scarlata, Mr. A. A. Selassie (EP), and Ms. M. Williams-Smith (assistant). Mr. A. R. Ismael, Office of the Executive Director for Mauritius, attended some of the final policy meetings. Further discussions were held between the Mauritian authorities and the staff team on October 9 during the 1995 Annual Meetings in Washington. 2J The background paper provides a comprehensive set of statistical tables; relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are attached as Appendices I and II, respectively.

The 1994/95 budget (July-June) recorded *n estimated overall deficit (including grants) of *bout 4 percent of GDP, compared with a budgeted level of 2.2 percent of GDP (Table 3); the deficit as well as net repayments of both external atid domestic nonbank debt were financed from the banking system (about 4.8 percent of GDP). Although the authorities initiated the process of indirect tax reform in 1994/95 (rationalizing the highly complex structure of import taxes, reducing the rates of customs duties overall, and extending the excise system to imports), the revenue measures recommended by the FAD technical assistance mission were not adopted. Consequently, the declining trend in the tax/GDP ratio observed since lVVO/Vl continued. u Current expenditures also exceeded budget estimates by some 0.5 percent of GDP, and measures were not put in place during the fiscal year to compensate for the lower revenue expectations. . After increasing by 17.3 percent in the previous year, broad money growth decelerated to *bout 13 percent in 1994/95 (Table 4), accompanied by a decline in net foreign assets and a slowdown in overall credit expansion. Increases in both credit to the private sector and net claims on Government have contributed to the monetary expansion of the past two years. . For the second year in a row, Mauritius's external accounts have weakened: the current account deficit widened in 1994/95 to 5.1 percent of GDP, from 2.3 percent of GDP in the previous year (Table 5), as the trade account deteriorated sharply. The Mauritian authorities stated that there were basically two factors responsible for the deterioration in the external current account in 1994/95. These included a shortfall in sugar exports (by some 4 percent) on account of the impact of drought and cyclones on sugar availability; and a significant increase in payments for aircraft purchases by Air Mauritius (which contributed about 3 percent of GDP to the deterioration in the current account). The capital account recorded a larger surplus, mainly due to increased net inflows from direct and portfolio investments following the liberalization of international financial transactions. Nevertheless, external reserves declined by about SDR 60 million, to about four months' imports at end-June 1995. u . On September 29, 1993. Mauritius accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and, except for the multiple currency practice *rising from the provision of exchange rate guarantees on deposits 1/ The trend reflects successive reductions in the tax burden on imports, as well as the increased provision of fiscal incentives in the form of tax relief. &I The gross official reserves have declined from SDR 680.8 million in 1991/92 (7 months of imports) to SDR 437.1 million in 1994/95 (4.2 months of imports).

Subsequently, in the 1994/95 budget, the Maurftian authorities completed the liberalisation of the capital account (see SM/94/191), introduced a flexible exchange rate system based on a" interbank exchange market, and suspended the Exchange Control Act. Between 1989/90 and 1994/95, the nominal effective exchange rate has recorded a modest depreciation of about 9 percent, while the real effective exchange rate has remained virtually stable (Chart 2). II. peuort on the Discussions In addition to the weaker domestic economic performance noted above, the consultation discussions took place against the background of a difficult political situation for the ruling party and its five-party alliance, as well as a changing international economic environment for a large part of Mauritius's exports in the context of the Uruguay Round (UR). MOKeOVeK) the recent liberalisation of both the current and capital accounts of the external sector, as well as the new flexible exchange system, put a" added premium on strong macroeconomic policies. The ruling alliance lost two by-elections at the beginning of 1994. While this has not affected the Government's overall parliamentary majority, it has prompted relatively early preparations for parliamentary elections (due by September 1996, although the Electoral Law allows a delay of up to six months) as well as a number of concessions in economic and financial policies. Consequently, although bold policy measures were take" by the authorities in the past two years (see Box l), to lay a sound foundation for a" efficient and competitive economy, some of these policy actions (such as the initiatives on a National Pay and Productivity Council (NPPC) and the reform of pension arrangements) have stalled. Owing to a number of domestic factors in the European Union (EU), the current assessment is that the likely impact of the UR for Mauritius (both for sugar and textile exports) may now be somewhat less negative--at least in the medium term--than initially envisaged, although the long-term prospects, particularly for textiles, remain uncertain. 2/ In the face of the mixed signals connected with recent slippages and delays in the policy area, a" atmosphere of "wait-and-see" pervades the decisions of both domestic and international investors, and the growing domestic and external imbalances carry the risk of later forcing a costly adjustment on the economy. Accordingly, the discussions were aimed at u These restrictions were approved by the Fund until July 31, 1996, when all of these deposits will mature (EBD/93/161 and H/93/199, Sup. 1). 2/ See note on the Impact of the Uruguay Round on Mauritius in the background paper.

Structural wlicies Structural policies--mainly at the sectoral level and related to labor market rigidities--are designed to respond to five issues: the continuing vulnerability to recurring droughts and cyclones; the potential impact of the UR on major exports (sugar and textiles); the need to strengthen competitiveness by addressing the rigidities in the centralised wage determination system; the intense competition facing Mauritius's upscale, long-haul tourism sector and the difficulty of accessing new and profitable routes; and the development of offshore and other sectors. Economic resilience to drought and cyclones. The economy is recovzring and growth is projected to reach 5 percent in 1995/96. Based on present trends, the inflation rate may be somewhat higher. The resilience of the economy reflects the broadly favorable results of past economic diversification efforts; of the "four pillars" of the Mauritian economy-- sugar, the EPZ, tourism, and the growing offshore sector--only the EPZ is expected to continue to encounter significant problems. . The sugar sector's promising prospects and related policies. Present indications for 1995/96 are that Mauritius should again, as in the previous year, meet its quota of sugar exports to the EU. The authorities are targeting a significant increase in production--to 560,000 tons--in 1995/96 in order to fulfil1 partially an additional annual quota of 85,000 tons (for an initial period of six years), to make up for the so- called Refiners' Deficit in Europe, u at a price equal to at least 85 percent of the guaranteed price for the EU, with prospects for renewal upon completion of the contract. Largely'on the basis of the recommenda- tions .of a special Mauritian study--the Julien Report--the 1995/96 budget speech includes a number of incentives and measures, which, if implemented, should increase sugar production over the period 1996-98 to 670,000 tons. u The additional quota and the new measures have infused new life into the sugar sector, which was facing difficulties, owing principally to the declining availability of land. In addition--mainly because of lobbying by European producers to protect beet sugar prices under the UR, to which the cane price is linked--the Mauritian representatives stated that sugar prices are not now expected to decline as initially assumed. . Strengthening the EPZ sector's performance. Even by its recent standards, the EPZ's performance in 1994/95 was particularly poor: value u This is the deficit in the refineries in Portugal, France, UK, and Finland. &' The phased program measures include: varietal improvements; improved irrigation; a seven-year cane cycle (large producers currently have an a-year cycle and small producers a lo- to 12-year cycle); increased use of fertilizers; application of ripeners: the rehabilitation of hitherto fallow sugarcane lands; development of new acreage in former tea growing areas; and improvements in sugar recovery at the factory level.

The EPZ sector has lost competitiveness (see Box 2) as reflected in the movement of A staff analysis of Mauritius!s external oompetitiveness broadly indicates that Mauritius has been losing .compatitivsness vis-A-vis its trading partners and, moreimportantly, other developing countries over the past several years. The findings of this analysis are as follows: l CPI-based real exchange rates do not show any appreciation, and have been broadly constant since 1987 (see Chart 2). l However, indicators based on broader price indices, such as the GDP and export price deflators, as well as on manufacturing sector-specific indices, such as unit labor costs, show that there has been an appreciation in the range of lo-40 percent in the real exchange rate between 1987 and 1994. a In addition, textile industry-specific comparisons of Mauritius and other reference textile exporting countries (such as India, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong; and South Korea) also point to a loss of competitiveness, as unit labor costs,in the apparel industry have grown in general much faster in Mauritius than in competitor countries between 1985 and 1991. This loss of competitiveness has resulted from higher growth in labor cost, or slower growth in labor productivity, depending on the reference country to which Mauritius is compared. source: Background paper. a number of firms' production activity to Madagascar, in search of cheaper labor, and. as a result, the growth of EPZ exports has slowed down markedly. Moreover, the number of new enterprises established last year fell to its lowest level in a decade, and foreign direct investment in this sector has practically dried up. Based on current trends, the growth of the EPZ sector is expected to fall further to 3 percent in 1995/96. Consequently, the Mauritisn authorities stated that the 1995/96 budget includes a package of monetary measures (see below), which are designed to encourage investment in the sector and enable it to regain its earlier dynamism. In addition, the authorities expect that the World Bank's Competitiveness Project u for Mauritius (in support of the Government's efforts to strengthen tech- nological capacity, to enhance productivity gains, and increase flexibility in labor and other markets) will play a major role in revitalising the EPZ. jJ Technical Assistance to Enhance Competitiveness Project (approved by the World Bank Board in May 1994).

The mission emphasized the need to strengthen the competitiveness of the economy, as an essential element of ongoing diversification efforts. This will involve policies to increase labor productivity and help contain the pressure of wage increases on unit labor costs (Chart 3) in various sectors of the economy. u Policies in this area aim for: improved efficiency in labor use (through, inter alia, the redeployment of labor from less productive to more productive sectors), a process presently hindered by a number of factors, notably rigid labor laws; the privatization of selected public enterprises; and increased investment in human resource development (education, training, and health) such as is being undertaken by the Government under the Industrial Vocational Training Board (IVTB) and other programs as well as by the Mauritius's Employers' Federation. In particular, the mission urged the authorities to t&e early action on the much-delayed establishment of the NPPC (see SM/94/191) to replace the present cumbersome wage-setting system-- comprising both sporadic sectoral awards (with a tendency to leapfrog) and annual tripartite negotiations setting a general economy-wide cost-of-living adjustment--with one linking rewards more closely (and in a decentralized manner) to efforts and productivity. The Mauritian representatives expressed the hope that this could be done shortly, but that substantive action was unlikely before the general elections. . Promoting the growth of the tourism sector. Despite intense and growing competition from similar high-cost destinations, the tourism sector in Mauritius continued to register strong growth in 1994, and prospects are good for 1995. Tourist arrivals increased by 7 percent in 1994, to reach 400,000 for the first time, and are projected to rise by about 5 percent in 1995 to 420,000. The continued growth of the sector is attributable to the successful marketing of Mauritius in the upper segment of the market as a top resort center, with high-quality hotels providing a very personalized service. Nonetheless, efforts are under way to further strengthen the tourism sector. These include: the provision of institutional support for the construction of additional hotels (including small and medium-sized hotels) to add capacity for the sector; the intensification of promotional campaigns in the new Asian and Australian markets; the provision of incentives for the development of support activities (designed to enhance the attractiveness of Mauritius as a tourist destination) such as aquariums, amusement parks, and diving caters; and the development of inland ecotourism facilities. . Fostering the development of offshore and other sectors. The offshore financial and business services sector continued to grow rapidly during 1994, largely on account of the double-taxation agreement between lJ The wage pressures reflect a labor shortage (the unemployment rate is 1.6 percent). This is presently ameliorated, among other things, by imported labor, estimated at 5,000-7,000, about two thirds of whom are employed in the textile sector.

In addition to creating some employment, the sector also generates value-added through custodial services offered by banks, as well as accounting and legal services by professionals. Regarding other sectors of the economy, the Mauritian representatives stated that work on the development of transshipment and entrepBt activities by the Mauritian Freeport Authority (MFA) (see SM/94/191) was proceeding smoothly. However, in considering proposals for processing activities in the Freeport, the MFA has been constrained by lack of space. To ease this constraint. some 25 hectares have been allocated to the MFA; the World Bank has provided a loan of Mau Rs 140 milli on for site preparation and it is proposed to lease space to the private sector on a long-term basis. The 1995/96 budget also contains some incentives and measures to encourage nonsugar agricultural production (such as fruits, vegetables, flowers) and the livestock sector, as well as fisheries. 2. Macroeconomic policies Domestic demand, propelled by government consumption and total domestic investment, is forecast to grow more rapidly in real terms (about 7 percent) than real GDP. There is also a risk that these trends may be accompanied by an accommodative monetary policy, as reflected in a high rate of credit expansion. a. Fiscal policies In discussing the 1995/96 budget, the Mauritian representatives recognized the need to reduce demand pressures by bringing about a sharper reduction in the budget deficit than the envisaged reduction to 3 percent of GDP (which entails financing from the domestic banking system of about 3.2 percent of GDP). Excluding prospective equity sales, amounting to Mau Rs 1.9 billion, or 2.6 percent of GDP, the budget deficit is likely to reach 5.6 percent of GDP. In discussing potential revenue measures, the mission inquired about the prospect of reforming the sales tax in line with FAD recommendations, noting that it would facilitate the move to a value-added tax and that a one percentage point increase in the sales tax rate (currently at 5 percent) could raise revenues by about 0.5 percent of GDP. The Mauritian representatives recognized the importance of reforming the sales tax, but indicated that social considerations precluded action at this time. The mission expressed concern that the 1995/96 budget did not include revenue- 1/ See SM/94/191 for a discussion of the nature of the sector and the reasons for its rapid growth: for an update on the sector, see the note in the background paper.

In particular, measures had not been taken to offset the revenue loss from the changes in excise duties introduced in 1994/95, which is estimated at about Mau Rs 300 million (0.5 percent of 1994/95 GDP). Instead, the Mauritian representatives called attention to the reform of income taxation of individuals end corporations (to be phased $lauritfua - FAD Proposals for Reform of Customs l&&&s and Excise Duties in 1995/96 The following eight proposals (four each in relation to customs duties and excise duties) were made to continue the process of indirect tax reform in 1995/96: Customs Duties l Removal of the anomalies in the present tariff system. e Reduction of the number of zero-rated items, which still account.for a high proportion (47 percent) of total imports, from the present tariff. e Curtailing further the scope of exemptions and concessions, which accounted for almost 49 percent of the customs receipts forgone. b Reduction of the range of customs duties further with a view tb reducing ever time, and in a revenue-neutral fashion, the.high levels of protection, as well as realigning the tariff structure according to the degree of processing.. gxciss Duties l Increases in the rates of emfse.duties on liquor products and cigarettes to reccver the revenue loss that was incurred last year. a Re-exsmination of the rates of excise duties on imports. If the loss of revenues in 1994/95 is to be recbvered, the rates of excise duties on imports should be brought up to the levels that would equalize their total (customs duty plus excise duty) burdens with those (cf total import taxes) prevailing before 1994/95. For imports of excisable items, exemptions from excise duties should not be granted (except to honcr international conventions and contracts), and the excessively large exemptions of automobiles from excise duties should.be eliminated. l Removing the protective element in domestic excise duties vis-a-vis the nominal rates of excise duties on imports, preferably by raising the excise duties levied on domestic outputs; a complete elimination of the.gap between the two rates would be consistent with UT0 rules, and would also help raise revenues. As a minimum, the gap should at least be narrowed, starting in 1995/96. l Rationalizing the base.of excise duties on imports.

I/ Several tax incentives had been introduced, and measures lowering income and profit taxes .for both enterprises and house- holds were announced for implementation in 1996/97. They stated that various tax incentives were provided in the 1995/96 budget for the key sectors of the economy (such as textiles, sugar, and tourism) to help level the playing field between these sectors and the EPZ sector. The reform plYOgl-~ID, which is revenue neutral, aims broadly at simplifying the income tax system, making it more transparent, achieving greater equity, and fostering efficient resource allocation. To raise budgetary resources in the meantime, a decision has bee" made to undertake sizable equity sales. The Government is proceeding with its privatization program for selected public enterprises, largely through the sale of as many shares of the relevant public enterprises as are needed for it to be listed on the stock exchange. 2/ On the expenditure side, the mission, while welcoming the study of the parastata1 sector, and urging accelerated work in this area, regretted that the drive for pension reform was losing momentum. Although the proposals for the reform of the pension arrangements (with a view to raising the retirement age from 60 to 65 years and improving the funding and transfera- bility of pensions) have been worked out in detail and a White Paper issued, the recommendations are likely to be implemented more gradually than earlier envisaged, largely because of strong opposition by the trade unions. MOreOVelI) the subsidy on rice and flour (amounting to Mau Rs 200 million or 0.3 percent of GDP) was deemed socially necessary and reintroduced, eve" though the mission argued strongly for their replacement with more targeted safety nets. b. Monetary policies Commenting on monetary developments and policies, the Mauritian representatives stated that the slowdown in the growth of total credit in 1994/95 refLected mainly a deceleration in credit to the private sector, due lJ The reform program includes: for individuals, the removal of all discrimination against women in the tax laws; increases in the limit of the PAYE exemption threshold, in personal reductions as well as in various allowa"ces. For companies, it includes the simplification of the Current Payment System (CPS), the rationalization of various allowances, tax credits and deductions; and the accordance of similar tax treatment (at the reduced rate of 15 percent) to companies in the manufacturing and agroindustrial sectors as is the case with EPZ companies. Also, a new tax regime with the same lower tax rate of 15 percent currently levied on domestic companies will apply to the companies registered in the offshore sector as from July 1, 1998; existing companies will also be given the right to be governed by the new tax regime. 2/ Even so, investor reluctance Co buy new shares presently pervades the Stock Exchange. A task force on the reform of parastatal entities (esta- blished earlier in 1995) is also expected to report by about early 1996, with a view to proposing a new charter for parastatals.

Accordingly, to provide increased resources to the EPZ sector, the 1995/96 budget included a number of measures (see Box 4); the mission. however, expressed reservation about their distortionary nature (see below).

It stressed the need to reduce the fiscal deficit and its bank financing to provide scope for adequate credit expansion to the private sector. A reduction of the fiscal deficit would also facilitate the development of the auction system for Treasury bills, which had slowed, to some extent, because of concerns about the interest cost of the Government's deficit financing needs. The mission also noted that, although the ceilings distinguishing between credit to priority and nonpriority sectors had been eliminated, the 1995/96 budget speech had introduced a number of nonmarket policy Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - interventions, which sought to direct resources to increase commercial bank lending to the EPZ sector, establish special loan guarantee schemes, and reduce the cxst of borrowing to the EPZ. It pointed out that these measures carried the risk of generating quasi-fiscal losses and distorting the structure of interest rates. Finally, given that the foreign trade and exchange system was virtually free of restrictions (on current and capital transactions), there was a pressing need to liberalize further the domestic financial sector, and to allow financial transactions to be conducted under competitive market conditions. As regards interest rate policy, the authorities noted that the auction of Treasury bills provided the primary modality for establishing market- based interest rates, and that they planned to respond SOOTI to the proposals by MAE to develop further the bill market as part of a process of reform of monetary instruments and operating procedures. They stated that, in the meantime, adjustments in the Bank Rate (which was currently higher than international interest rates, both in nominal and real terms) have been used to signal the direction of the Government's anti-inflationary policy. Thus, reflecting c.xcerns about inflation in the first half of the year, the Bank Rate was increased from 8 percent in January 1994 to 13 percent by November 1994. By December, the deceleration in inflation. as well as concerns about the interest cost of government borrowing, prompted the authorities to signal a drop in interest rates; hence, the Bank Rate was reduced to 10 percent and held at that level through June 1995 (Chart 4). Subsequently, in order to link more closely adjustments in the Bank Rate to changes in the Treasury bill rate, it was announced in the 1995/96 budget that the Bank Rate would be calculated as the weekly average of the Treasury bill rate (rather than a 12-week average, as previously), plus 0.25 percent. c. External sector prosuects and uolicies Mauritius's near and medium-term balance of payments outlook would be greatly improved by tighter financial, especially fiscal, policies (Table 6). In this connection, the introduction of the recommended sales tax reform in 1996/97 would contribute about 2 percent of GDP to a projected narrowing of the fiscal deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP: continued expenditure restraint should enable a further reduction in the deficit to less than 1 percent by 1999/2000. The increase in domestic savings resulting from the improved position of the public sector would, in turn, allow for a narrowing of the external current account deficit, while maintaining gross domestic investment at a level required to sustain economic growth at 5-6 percent per annum. However. this scenario depends on a number of important assumptions, including those regarding the new sugar agreement, a tighter stance of financial policies, and a flexible exchange rate policy that would help to limit any further weakening of gross international reserves. 1/ Otherwise, the growing domestic and external imbalances would disrupt u The foreign reserves are projected to decline from the equivalent of 4 months of imports in 1994/95 to about 3 months of imports by 1999/2000.

AS regards reserve management, the Mauritian representatives stated that the two-tier arrangement--under which fund managers were entrusted with investing about 25 percent of Mauritius's reserves for a higher long-term return and the balance was managed by the BOH--was being managed prudently and satisfactorily (see H/94/191). While the returns on the long-term investments (which were held mostly in blue chip Treasury papers of the OECD governments) were higher, maximization of current income was not the objective. In addition, the total amount for the fund managers would be released gradually, in tranches, following satisfactory review of the performance on earlier tranches. In reviewing the operation of the interbank exchange market (established on July 15, 1994), 1/ th e authorities noted that they were considering measures to increase competition in the market, by licensing other participants in the market (such as foreign exchange bureaus); accordingly, such actions are reportedly imminent. 2~' Meanwhile, the BOM's intervention policies appeared to be geared to maintaining an unsustainable intervention rate--relative to an undisclosed basket of currencies--within an unspecified band; in the process, the BOM sought to discourage speculative deals. so far, the BOM has had to intervene only in one direction, that is to supply the domestic market with U.S. dollars; given the continuing loss of reserves, this situation was not sustainable. In the circumstances, and in light of the erosion of competitiveness (noted in Box 2 above) as well as the persistent pressures in the interbank exchange market, the Mauritian authorities were urged to allow the exchange rate to depreciate, and to support such a policy by removing the existing rigidities in interest rate determination and relying on appropriately tight financial policies. Exchange market intervention should aim basically at maintaining a relatively comfortable level of reserves (as a ratio of imports) and to smoothing out temporary fluctuations. J/ The staff also stressed the need to eliminate the existing rigidities in wage determination (discussed in Section II.1 above), in order to preserve the gains from exchange rate depreciation. Commenting on regional initiatives such as the Cross Border Initiative, the Mauritian representatives stated that Mauritius has already gone relatively far in liberalizing its economy and trade regime, and that other countries in the region needed to take reciprocal steps. u See description in the background paper. 2/ Apart from initial problems arising from the newness of the system, the other institutional aspects of the interbank market are working reasonably well. 3J The authorities have requested technical assistance from the Fund to improve the operations of the interbank exchange system, with particular reference to the conduct of intervention policies.

The mission confirmed that all the remaining restrictions on capital transactions have been eliminated, including the 5 percent transfer tax on residents investing abroad, which was abolished following the suspension of the Exchange Control Act on July 27, 1994. . The quality and timeliness of Mauritius's reporting of the core aininum data to the Fund (Table 7), as well as other economic and financial statistics are, in general, satisfactory (see Appendix III). The authorities have noted the staff's recommendations to produce higher frequency fiscal data (quarterly or monthly), as well as balance of payments data (perhaps quarterly, at least in summary), and having both published in m. The staff is awaiting the authorities' approval of the publication of data on Mauritius's effective exchange rates in the IFS; in addition to publishing some data on the economy themselves, the Mauritian authorities also do not object to the regular publication of economic and financial data by the Fund. IV. Staff Auuraisal The Mauritian economy has experienced a slowdown in growth over the past two fiscal years (1993/94-1994/95). The fiscal and external current account deficits have widened and gross official foreign reserves have fallen steadily. Moreover, rising unit labor costs have weakened the competitiveness of textiles and other manufacturing activities in the EPZ sector. These developments, as well as Mauritius's move to an open capital .¶cc0u*t, underscore the need to strengthen the anti-inflationary stance of financial policies and improve Mauritius's international competitiveness. The staff is concerned that, despite the large increase in the fiscal deficit in 1994/95 to about twice the level of the preceding year, the 1995/96 budget targets only a small reduction in the deficit and does not include any revenue-enhancing measures. Furthermore, the small budgeted reduction in the 1995/96 deficit is predicated largely on prospective one- time equity sales to the public, and the underlying fiscal deficit is projected to widen substantially. Thus, there remains an urgent need for strong, structural fiscal adjustment. The staff urges the authorities to apply the proceeds of equity sales toward a reduction of government debt rather than funding higher levels of current expenditures. There is also a need to take early action to implement the overdue reform of the sales tax, as recommended by the Fund, with the objective of introducing it in the 1996/97 budget. The reintroduction of general subsidies for rice and flour, which the authorities had successfully replaced in May 1993 with a means- tested, special income support program for the needy, is also worrisome. The staff believes that general subsidies on basic necessities such as rice and flour result in a misallocation of resources and have been found to be ineffective as a means of assisting the less privileged. Accordingly, the staff urges the Mauritian authorities both to explore ways of offsetting the subsidy, through revenue and expenditure measures, and, in the next fiscal yea=, to revert to a more targeted approach similar to that in place prior Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - to the recent budget. The authorities are also encouraged to implement the recommendations for the reform of the pension system as soon as possible, Meanwhile, slippages in the implementation of the 1994/95 budget point to the need to strengthen the expenditure monitoring system, so that timely action can be taken if, as in 1994/95, anticipated revenues do not materialize. While the staff notes the authorities' intention to rely on a tight monetary policy to contain inflationary pressures, it will be important to ensure that this instrument is not overburdened. To this end, reducing the fiscal deficit and its domestic bank financing will be essential. The staff also urges the authorities to assign an unambiguously high priority to the development of more market-oriented monetary policy instruments. In this regard, the recent reduction in liquid assets and reserve requirements designed to release resources for increased credit allocation to particular sectors, such as the EPZ. represents a backtracking from the authorities' earlier policy of financial market liberalization and reliance on market- based instruments of monetary control. Furthermore, the emphasis in the foreseeable future must be on the development of a monetary framework that would permit a more flexible interest rate policy. The liberalization of interest rate policy within a fully functional market-based system should allow reserve requirements to be substantially reduced over time. Proposals to this end have been made by MAE, and the staff strongly urges the authorities to act on these proposals as a matter of urgency. The staff commends the Mauritian authorities for the recent establish- ment of an interbank exchange market, and the subsequent suspension of the Exchange Control Act. These measures will require more attention to the implementation of strong macroeconomic policies. The staff is concerned that the authorities' present intervention strategy in the exchange market-- which has led to a continuing loss of foreign reserves--is not sustainable. It should be replaced by a comprehensive package of appropriately tight monetary and fiscal policies and a more flexible wage policy, which would help to improve competitiveness, promote economic growth, and strengthen the external position: in addition, there is a need to improve efficiency through structural reforms. In the context of such a policy package, the authorities should also be prepared to allow the exchange rate to depreciate in response to the continuing pressures in the exchange market to avoid any undue weakening of the foreign reserve position. Given Mauritius's relatively tight labor situation, the staff considers that the future growth strategy must be based firmly on sustained efforts to increase labor productivity; this would help to offset the effect of wage increases on unit labor costs in various sectors of the economy. To this end, in addition to determined implementation of the competitiveness project of the World Bank, the staff urges the authorities to take early action on the much-delayed establishment of the National Pay and Productivity Council, to replace the present cumbersome wage-setting arrangements under the annual tripartite negotiations with more flexible arrangements linking wags awards more closely to effort and productivity. While noting the adequacy of the quality and timeliness of Mauritius's reporting of the core minimum data to the Fund, the staff urges the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - authorities to produce and communicate to the Fund fiscal and balance of payments data with a higher frequency, in light of the importance of these data for effective surveillance. The staff proposes that the next Article N consultation with Mauritius be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

IFC has made four loans in 1971, 1981, 1990, and 1991 for tourism development, two loans in 1987 and 1990 for textile projects, and one loan in 1991 for transport and storage. In 1992, it made a loan for capital market development and also invested in a Country Fund. In the 198Os, the Bank's lending program in Mauritius supported macro- and sectoral policies that the Government needed to pursue to bring about structural adjustment in the economy. The strategy for Bank lending therefore linked bank loans directly and indirectly to policy reforms in general and in specific sectors, and included quick-disbursing lending to alleviate balance of payments constraints on structural reforms and growth. With the success of the structural adjustment effort, the need for quick- disbursing resources declined and there has been a return to more traditional project lending. A.

However, an important priority will be to produce and report for publication higher frequency fiscal and balance of payments data (at least on a quarterly basis). The Hauritian authorities already publish some economic data on Mauritius, and do not object to the regular publication of such data by the Fund. The staff is awaiting the authorities' approval of the publication of data on Mauritius's effective exchange rates in m. 1. Real sector Annual national accounts data are prepared on a calendar-year basis, and expenditure components are reported regularly by the Bank of Mauritius for publication in m; the Central Statistical Office (CSO) is still working on developing quarterly national accounts data. National accounts at constant prices have been produced using 1992 as the base year; however, these data have not yet been verified for publication in m. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated on the basis of actual prices (not controlled or "official" prices), and is regularly rebased as consumption patterns and relative prices change (most recently to July-June 1992 - 100, using weights from a 1990 household expenditure survey). Data are cabled to STA during the following month for use in m. Indices on producer prices, unit labor cost, and employment have been developed, but have not been reported for publication in m. Trade aggregates are reported on a quarterly basis. 2. Government Mauritius continues to be a regular and timely reporter of GFS data and the data continue to be of good quality. However, data are reported only on a yearly basis, and an important priority will be to increase the frequency of reporting. 3. Monetarv accounts Data provision to STA and AFR has been consolidated on STA's monthly reports, which are immediately available to AFR. 4. Balance of Davments Following the establishment of a new format for balance of payments data in the fifth edition of the BOP manual, the Bank of Mauritius has provided data with this new format.

The Bank of Mauritius is continuing to work on this problem. Data are provided on a yearly basis, although infor- mation is available on a half-yearly basis, and it will be important to increase the frequency of reporting (perhaps on a quarterly basis).
