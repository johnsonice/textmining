Introduction The discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation and the third review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) were held in Amman during June 13-21, 1995. I/ The representatives of Jordan were led by the Minister of Finance and Customs and included the Ministers of Planning and of Industry, the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ), and other senior officials. 2J The last Article IV consultation with Jordan was concluded by the Executive Board on May 25, 1994, y when the Executive Board also approved the authorities' request for the extended arrangement. On that occasion and during the subsequent two reviews under the extended arrangement, Executive Directors underscored the importance of: (i) continued tight policies and the maintenance of competitive interest rates as part of Jordan's efforts to build up gross official reserves; (ii) accelerating the pace of structural reforms; and (iii) opening up the economy further to create a more favorable environment for private sector domestic and foreign investment. All performance criteria through end-March 1995 under the extended arrangement were observed, except for the one relating to the net claims on the public sector by the banking system for end-March 1995 (Table 1). The Executive Board granted a waiver for its nonobservance on a lapse of time basis on June 6, 1995 (EBS/95/93, 6/l/95). The supplementary letter of intent from the Jordanian authorities for the third review under the arrangement, dated August 12, 1995, is attached as Appendix VI. Jordan has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, effective February 20, 1995. The quality of Jordan's economic and financial data is good, and data are provided to the Fund on a timely basis (Appendix V). I/ On May 25, 1994 the Executive Board approved a three-year arrangement under the EFF in an amount equivalent to SDR 127.8 million (35 percent of Jordan's quota on an annual basis). In support of the Government's strengthened macroeconomic program and need to improve Jordan's gross official reserves, the Executive Board approved augmentations of Jordan's access under the EFF by SDR 25 million (20.5 percent of quota) on September 14, 1994 and SDR 36.5 million (30 percent of quota) on February 13, 1995. Jordan has made all scheduled purchases to date amounting to SDR 98.4 million. 2/ The staff mission comprised Messrs. Maciejewski (Head), Mansur, and McDermott (all MED), Ms. Alonso-Gamo (PDR), Mr. de Callatay (FAD), and Mrs. Miles (staff assistant, MED). Mr. Chabrier participated in some of the policy discussions. Mr. Fayyad, Advisor to the Executive Director for Jordan, attended the policy meetings. 3/ EBM/94/47 (5/25/94), SUR/94/59 (5/31/94), EBS/94/74 (4/7/94), and SM/94,'102 (4,'24/94).

Discussions on a Trade Policy Adjustment Loan (TPAL) are expected to be concluded in September. II. Recent Developments, Policy Implementation, and Prospects for 1995 Jordan's macroeconomic performance in 1994 under the extended arrangement remained in line with the EFF program objectives (Table 2 and Chart l), which were continued rapid and sustainable economic growth, low inflation, and an improvement in the external position with a view to restoring medium-term viability. To this end, the authorities have pursued firm demand-management policies and embarked on an ambitious program of structural reforms. In 1994, real economic growth (5.7 percent), inflation (3.5 percent), and the reduction of the external current deficit (5 percentage points in relation to GDP) were all better than programmed, and these trends continued in early 1995. With the marked pickup in tourism and trade-related activities, the unemployment rate declined in 1994, but remained high at about 13-15 percent. 2/ Notwithstanding continued firm monetary policy, the level of gross official reserves remained low (US$380 million or 1.2 months of imports at end-June 1995), particularly in view of such special factors as the lingering uncertainties in the region, and the possible future redemption of the Jordan dinars (JD) circulating in the West Bank Gaza Strip (WBGS). The structural reform effort has regained momentum since the beginning of 1995, and legislation related to the direct and indirect tax systems and the opening up of the economy and financial markets has been drafted and submitted to Parliament (Appendix II). 1. Real sector At 6.2 percent, real economic growth in 1995 is expected to remain buoyant and broad based, with particularly strong performances in mining, tourism-related services, agriculture, and construction. Although manufacturing output is projected to grow at a modest 2 percent--following average annual growth of more than 10 percent over the last five years--this may prove to be an underestimate, since capital investment in manufacturing L/ Jordan's relations with the Fund and the World Bank are presented in Appendices III and IV, respectively. 2/ The unemployment rate increased sharply to about 25 percent in 1991, following the return of 300,000 workers to Jordan in the wake of the August 1990 regional crisis. Rapid real growth in recent years allowed for their absorption and a remarkable reduction in unemployment. However, the current level remains excessively high and, in view of the rapid population growth, sustained real growth over the medium term would be needed to reduce it.

Reflecting increased domestic supply of agricultural products and prudent demand-management policies, the rate of inflation is envisioned to remain under 4 percent in 1995, 1.5 percentage points below the initial program target. After some delays, progress was registered since the last review in implementing structural reforms in the real sector. In particular, under the World Bank ASAL, irrigation water tariffs were raised and agricultural imports were liberalized; further privatization has also taken place. 2. Demand-manaeement policies Monetary policy continues to be geared toward maintaining the attractiveness of JD-denominated financial assets, in support of the exchange rate policy, in order to build up gross official reserves to a more comfortable level. For this purpose, the CBJ has maintained sizable interest rate differentials in favor of JD financial assets relative to foreign assets. Consistent with this policy, domestic interest rates have not followed the decline in U.S. dollar interest rates in recent months, thereby allowing the interest rate differentials in favor of JD-denominated assets to increase to about 2.7-2.9 percentage points vis-a-vis U.S. dollar- denominated assets of similar maturity. In 1994, broad money expansion was 8 percent, well below the original program target of 12.3 percent and nominal GDP growth of 9.9 percent (Table 3). The increase in net domestic assets of the banking system was limited to 6.6 percent of the beginning period stock of broad money, partly reflecting the tight credit stance, but mostly net repayments to the banking system by the Central Government and the contractionary effect of other items (net) resulting from the accumulation of reserves and capital by commercial banks. Monetary expansion decelerated further in the first four months of 1995, largely due to the impact of the high prevailing interest rates on demand for credit. With the steady strengthening of indirect monetary control operations, the CBJ eliminated the credit to deposit ratio in February 1995. In order to promote the development of the interbank market, the CBJ also excluded interbank deposits and borrowing denominated in JDs from the base subject to JD reserve requirements. Liquidity ratios are being maintained for prudential purposes, rather than used as monetary control instruments. To further strengthen prudential regulations governing commercial banks, the CBJ: (i) required an increase of the minimum paid-up capital of licensed Jordanian banks; (ii) imposed a 10 percent reserve requirement on customer's deposits and borrowing denominated in JDs for branches operating in the WBGS; and (iii) set tighter standards aimed at reducing the risks to banks arising from their single credit exposure. Following a period of sustained fiscal consolidation in recent years, in 1994 the central government deficit (excluding foreign grants) was higher than the program target (5.9 versus 5.0 percent of GDP), primarily due to the lower level of imports in 1994 and the shift in their composition toward Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicTab10 3.

Total expenditure was broadly in line with the program, but the quality of the Government's expenditure program suffered, as capital outlays in relation to GDP were lower than programmed, while wages and salaries, military expenditures, and food subsidies were higher. Reflecting these developments, the primary current balance deteriorated in 1994 compared with 1993. However, as a result of the effect of debt relief and external financing, the Central Government was able to reduce its outstanding stock of domestic bank credit by JD 57 million (1.3 percent of GDP), whereas the original 1994 program had not envisaged any repayments by the Government to the banking system. There were indications during the first months of 1995 that, in the absence of corrective measures, a number of adverse developments might jeopardize the attainment of the fiscal targets for the year: lower than expected revenue resulting from shifts in import composition; external interest payments larger than programmed (by 1.1 percentage points of GDP to 6.2 percent of GDP), due to higher interest rates and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis other major currencies; and an increase in food subsidies to 1.2 percent of GDP (compared with 0.8 percent envisaged under the program), owing to higher world prices. Under unchanged policies, the fiscal deficit (excluding foreign grants) was forecast to amount to 5.2 percent of GDP in 1995, compared with a program target of 4.3 percent of GDP, before the proposed package of rectifying measures. 3. External sector Continued strong performance of merchandise exports and services receipts led to a marked fall in the current account deficit in 1994 (6.5 percent of GDP versus a target of 9 percent) and is projected to contribute to a further reduction in the current account deficit to 5 percent of GDP in 1995, considerably lower than the initial program target of 8 percent of GDP (Table 5). Domestic exports are projected to grow by 15.6 percent in 1995, on account of the recovery in minerals and fertilizers and continuing growth in nontraditional exports, reflecting increased competitiveness of Jordan's products and renewed growth in export markets. Import payments declined in nominal terms in 1994, but showed a marked shift in favor of raw materials and capital equipment, which allowed for sustained economic expansion. Imports rebounded beginning in 1995 and are now projected to grow by 10 percent for the year as a whole, still below the initial program level. Notwithstanding the tightened monetary stance and improvements in the external current account deficit, the level of gross official reserves has remained excessively low, reflecting partly shortfalls in external financing disbursements and, at times; delays in adjusting interest rates. Moreover, the private sector continues to show a preference for holding U.S. dollar- denominated assets, which may be attributable to the uncertainties related to possible future redemption of the JDs currently circulating in the WBGS, and the low level of foreign exchange reserves itself in the face of such a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- Tab18 4.

L/ Private foreign direct investment inflows remain modest, still inhibited by regional uncertainties, the high level of external debt, and a number of structural rigidities. However, as a result of the recent and prospective progress on the structural reform front, official balance of payments financing has resumed (and is expected to accelerate in the second half of 1995) while it is expected that foreign investment will pick up. The authorities have pursued an exchange rate policy of nominal stability of the JD vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, geared to maintain confidence in the currency and encourage inward flows. Given the weakening of the U.S. dollar, this policy has led to a depreciation of the JD by about 10 percent in real effective terms over the 12-month period through April 1995 (Chart 2), resulting in improved external competitiveness. III. Policy Discussions The discussions considered the need to strengthen the macroeconomic policy stance, in particular through a reversal of the moderate fiscal slippage envisaged for 1995, in order to maintain good price performance and to achieve the gross official reserve target of about US$600 million by end- 1995 (2.1 months of imports). On the structural front, the discussions focused on the core reforms which the authorities are planning to implement before the October 1995 Amman Economic Summit, especially those to encourage domestic and foreign private sector investment, if the objectives of the EFF program are to be realized. 1. The updated medium-term macroeconomic framework for 1995-2002 The baseline scenario that was projected in the staff report for the second EFF review has been updated (Table 6, Scenario I, EBS/95/7), to reflect the recent improvements in the external current account and the impact of foreign interest rates and exchange rate movements among major currencies. The updated framework is also predicated on continuing adjustment and timely and full implementation of structural reforms during the EFF period and beyond. Relative to earlier projections, the major macroeconomic objectives, fiscal adjustment path, and pace of reserve accumulation, have been kept essentially unchanged (Appendix I, Table 6). The framework shows a L/ The CBJ is not without additional resources: in addition to US$360 million of unencumbered gross official reserves, the CBJ holds US$lOO million of other deposits in foreign currency and US$300 million of gold against which it can borrow. On the other hand, although the CBJ also holds US$l.l billion of foreign exchange on account of commercial banks' obligatory reserves on foreign currency deposits, the authorities are determined not to utilize these reserves to defend the exchange rate, as it would likely lead to a loss of market confidence.

Under the updated scenario, total cumulative exceptional financing needs would be somewhat lower, but medium- term viability would still not be attained, and in the outer years external debt service payments (notably amortization) and financing gaps would continue to widen (Appendix I, Table 9). The authorities consider this updated medium-term scenario as leading to relatively low growth and stagnant consumption per capita, especially in the outeryears, with narrow scope for further adjustment if the essential employment objective is to be protected. Domestic savings are projected to increase substantially, but not enough to offset the decline in foreign savings. Private domestic investment would therefore be constrained, a problem compounded by the projected low level of capital inflows, as the risk persists that the continuing debt overhang might have a discouraging effect on foreign direct investment. Furthermore, the risks to even these modest targets have been accentuated by the projected higher service payments on outstanding external debt, and the uncertainties arising from the JDs circulating in the WBGS and their effects on the demand for JDs in the JD-area as a whole. The authorities expressed the view that, with further debt consolidation and more readily available external financing--on appropriately concessional terms given Jordan's overall debt burden--and the related beneficial impact on private flows, more ambitious growth targets could be set, thus enhancing social and political support for the reform program. 2. Short-term policy issues a. Fiscal policy The authorities remain convinced about the importance of continued fiscal consolidation for restoring Jordan's balance of payments viability in the medium term. They were therefore concerned about the unexpected deterioration in the fiscal deficit in 1994 and early 1995. Although this fiscal deterioration was largely attributable to exogenous factors, it highlighted the importance of continued structural reforms in the direct and indirect tax systems to widen the domestic tax base and improve tax elasticity; of containing the budgetary costs of the current food subsidy program through a combination of price adjustment and better targeting; and of continued prudent debt management policy. Consistent with this strategy, the overall fiscal deficit on a commitment basis (excluding foreign grants) is to be reduced to 4.6 percent of GDP in 1995. While this targeted fiscal deficit is somewhat higher than the initial program target of 4.3 percent of GDP, both the primary balance and the fiscal deficit on a cash basis would be better in 1995 than initially programmed. To achieve the needed adjustment, the Government increased in June the prices of barley (by an average of 21 percent) and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - other animal feeds, and intends to increase the basic General Sales Tax (GST) rate by 3 percentage points to lo'percent in August. In addition, the Government intends to raise license fees for cars and to limit expenditures on goods and services. These additional fiscal measures are projected to yield JD 28 million (0.6 percent of GDP) in 1995. b. Official reserve buildup. monetary. and exchange rate policies The authorities remain concerned that the low level of foreign exchange reserves, coupled with the continuing uncertainties arising from the future redemption of JDs circulating in the WBGS, have contributed to a lower demand for JDs since April 1994. Given the limited scope for further fiscal tightening in 1995, continued tight monetary policy through competitive domestic interest rates would need to be the primary instrument to achieve the reserve target. The authorities shared the staff representatives' assessment that the interest rate policy pursued since July 1994 had not adversely affected real economic growth and private sector investment in recent months. In addition, the staff stressed the importance of removing remaining structural biases against the holding of JD deposits, notably the desirability of harmonizing the remuneration of legal reserve requirements for JDs and foreign exchange deposits. Monetary expansion in 1994 was lower than the increase in nominal GDP, in line with the perceived lower demand for the JD. A similar situation should prevail in 1995, as net domestic assets are programmed to increase by 7.6 percent of the beginning period stock of broad money, while money supply would expand by 9.7 percent in 1995 (compared with a projected nominal GDP expansion of 10.8 percent). Accordingly, quarterly credit ceilings have been established for the net domestic assets of the CBJ and for the net claims on the banking system by the public sector, along with indicative targets for reserve money for end-September and end-December 1995 (Appendix I, Table 10). With the level of excess reserves at the lower-end of their historical levels, the liquidity position of the commercial banks has remained tight. On this basis, and with the expected seasonal increase in inflows of workers' remittances and the pickup in external disbursements, a turnaround in the gross official reserves position- -as happened during July-November 1994--is expected in the second half of 1995. Despite the external financing shortfalls in the first half of 1995, recent and prospective progress on the structural reform front would ensure that total external financing for the year would be broadly in line with program projections. Consistent with the gross official reserve target envisaged under the program, quarterly net international reserve floors of the CBJ have been established for end-September and end-December 1995 (Appendix I, Table 11). The CBJ will continue to closely monitor developments in foreign exchange reserves and to maintain interest rates differentials geared to ensure the attractiveness of JD-denominated assets vis-a-vis U.S. dollar- denominated assets. If needed, the CBJ intends to further increase those differentials through the sale of JD-denominated certificates of deposits. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - The authorities' exchange rate policy remains to maintain the de facto peg of the JD vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar; particularly in view of the continuing strong performance of external current account receipts, the key role of workers' remittances, and the need to attract foreign inflows. 3. Structural reforms A package of structural reforms--consisting of amendments to the GST, a reform of corporate and personal income tax, and a new investment law which rationalizes the incentive structure --has been agreed with the private sector and submitted to Parliament. The Government is confident that the package will be passed with no major changes and that it could be implemented prior to the Amman Economic Summit. These reforms will be complemented by a law governing the operations of the Amman Financial Market; further tariff reform; and ongoing real sector reforms under the World Bank ESAL and ASAL. Overall, the proposed reforms are consistent with the authorities' medium-term private sector and export-led strategy and should place Jordan in a position to benefit from prospective regional developments and new trade and financial opportunities. a. Tax policy reforms With a view to improving the design and operations of the GST system, the authorities intend to propose a number of other amendments to the current GST law, in addition to increasing the basic rate to 10 percent, The main measures are: (i) replacement of the positive list of taxable services by a negative list with limited exemptions; (ii) elimination of the current practice of subjecting capital goods to GST without allowing for tax credit; (iii) voluntary registration of taxpayers with turnover below a certain threshold; and (iv) provisions for introducing supplementary duty on selected luxury products, alcohol, and tobacco, to protect revenue in the context of the forthcoming external tariff reform/reduction. Further steps would need to entail extending the input tax credit to cover capital goods and nonembodied inputs; eliminating the scope for using the proposed supplementary excise duty for protective purposes; and further limiting the list of exempted goods. The draft legislation to reform the direct tax system includes a number of substantive improvements: (i) elimination of tax holidays (except for investments in less developed areas); (ii) limitation of tax deductibility to net interest payments; (iii) reduction of the number of tax rates and of the maximum tax rates for both personal and corporate income taxes to 30 percent; (iv) rationalization of corporate income tax rates with a view to treating all corporate sectors equally and reducing the standard corporate income tax rate to the level of the maximum tax rate for personal income; and (v) broadening of the tax base through reduction and simplification of exemptions and applying uniform standard deductions for all wage earners. Although the proposed law could entail a revenue loss of about JD 25 million (0.5 percent of GDP) in the first year, the authorities consider that it should be revenue-augmenting in the medium term because of the proposed elimination of tax holidays for most companies. Scope for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 .- further improvements remains in several areas: (i) the two corporate rates--the reduced rate of 15 percent being applicable to operations covered under the Investment Law--may be distortionary; (ii) agriculture, livestock, and reinsurance companies are exempted; and (iii) the criteria for favorable treatment lack transparency. b. Civil service reform and food subsidies As regards expenditure management, central government wage-related outlays 1/ and food subsidy programs- -accounting for about 80 percent of central government current primary expenditure- -are the two major structural problems seriously limiting the Government's flexibility in fiscal operations. If unattended, they could undermine the sustainability of its medium-term fiscal consolidation program. The current level of public sector employment relative to the size of the economy and total labor force is excessive, and there is a need for reducing the size of the public sector wage bill (in relation to GDP) over the medium term. Progress has already been made in containing civil service employment by limiting new hirings primarily to the education and health sectors, and a comprehensive civil service reform plan is being formulated with technical assistance from the World Bank. The Government has also undertaken background studies related to the development of a performance assessment, system data, and a management information system based on personnel data. Though significant gains have been registered so far in reducing the cost of the food subsidy program, the recent increase in world prices for wheat and barley has demonstrated the vulnerability of the budget to external developments in the absence of a proper mechanism for passing on the higher prices to consumers in a timely manner. The authorities are thus considering a fundamental reform of the current generalized food subsidy program by charging the full price to consumers, while protecting the low-income households through direct cash transfers based on family income/means tests. Such a scheme could be established by end-1995, and should enable the Government to contain budgeted subsidy/transfers to a specified level, generate net budgetary savings (about 0.5 percent of GDP, based on current costs), and also prevent wastage and smuggling of the subsidized products. C. Trade policy A more liberal trade regime, with the associated improvement in allocational efficiency and increased access to foreign markets, remains key to Jordan's export-led growth strategy. Therefore, with a view to opening A/ Covering civilian and military wages and salaries, pensions, and the bulk of transfers to decentralized agencies. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - up the economy and building on the first stage of customs tariff reform implemented in November 1994, the Government intends to formulate, by August 1995, an action plan for further improvement of the tariff regime. Consistent with the Government's earlier commitments under the EFF, the following elements are to be implemented in 1995: a simplification of the customs tariff regime by combining the existing numerous fees and charges into one consolidated tariff structure; a significant reduction of the number of tariff rates; a reduction of nontariff barriers through elimination of import licensing requirements and import monopolies; and a further substantial reduction of the maximum effective duty from the current level of 70 percent (including 20 percent on account of various fees and surcharges), except for three categories of products: cars, alcoholic beverages, and cigarettes. Following the reduction of tariff barriers, the proposed incorporation of the provision for supplementary excise duty under the modified GST legislation should help the Government in protecting fiscal revenue, with equal treatment to domestic and imported goods. These reforms are also being supported by the World Bank's ASAL and the proposed TPAL. The authorities remain concerned, however, about: the short-term effects of trade liberalization on domestic import-competing industries; Jordan's ability to compete in services (including financial markets); and protection of domestic industries from unfair foreign competition (if imports are subsidized by the producing/exporting countries). Any short-term costs would nonetheless be outweighed over the medium term by the benefits of a more open trade system and greater integration with international markets, especially if Jordan is to attract increased foreign direct investment. The authorities are initiating discussions on a bilateral agreement with the European Union (EU) and on accession to the World Trade Organization. These should significantly increase welfare and efficiency in Jordan through wider market access for Jordanian goods and increased international competition. Trade between Jordan and the WBGS and transshipment to the WBGS through Jordan have been limited thus far, but the potential for trade and cooperation in regional infrastructure development between Israel, Jordan, and the WBGS is nonetheless considerable and should eventually materialize, following further progress in political and security-related issues. d. Real sector reforms Under the ongoing reform of the energy sector operations supported by the World Bank ESAL, the authorities are seeking certain financial targets in the operations of the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) either through financial restructuring measures or by an increase in the average electricity tariff; a detailed financial and institutional restructuring plan for the power sector, including the incorporation of the JEA; establishment of a transparent regulatory regime; reorganization of the Ministry of Energy; and establishment of a new oil and gas company to be formed out of the assets of an existing public entity. The authorities expect that all reforms associated with the second tranche release of this ESAL should be completed by November 1995. The staff cautioned that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - implementing quickly the measures that would allow for timely disbursement of the World Bank ESAL second tranche and the first tranche of the proposed TPAL remained crucial to ensure adequate balance of payments financing. As part of its privatization program, the Government has sold a large part of its shares in the Jordan Hotels and Tourism Company, and completed the commercialization of the Alia Gateway Hotel and duty free shops at the Amman International Airport. The Telecommunication Corporation (TCC) is allowing the private sector to provide complementary services; and a strategy to privatize the TCC should be completed by end-1995 under the World Bank Telecommunications Project. On the other hand, the planned privatization of the Royal Jordanian Airline is likely to be delayed. Despite successful restructuring and cost containments efforts, the financial performance of RJ continues to be weak, and it is estimated that a substantial capital injection would be needed for privatization to proceed. e. Financial sector and other regulatory reforms With the steady strengthening of indirect monetary control operations and supporting reforms, the CBJ has implemented most of the structural reforms recommended by the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department of the Fund. These reforms have enabled the CBJ to intervene effectively without resorting to ad hoc and arbitrary use of credit limits, and enabled the banks to respond efficiently to the CBJ's interest rate policy being pursued through open market operations. The banks responded to the steady signals for higher interest rates given by the CBJ by gradually rearranging their balance sheet. The development of a domestic interbank market has been encouraged by the exclusion of both interbank deposits and borrowing denominated in JD from the base subject to JD reserve requirements. The CBJ also intends to undertake a study relating to the operations of the foreign exchange interbank market, with a view to increasing its efficiency and broadening the scope of its operations. Further initiatives to enhance the efficiency of the financial system and to deepen financial intermediation are being discussed with the World Bank. The Government submitted to Parliament in July 1995 a new law regulating domestic and foreign investment. The draft law allows for equal treatment of all investors and aims to rationalize the incentive structure and open the financial market to all foreign investors, and should help establish a stable and predictable environment for the private sector in an open financial system. This law would be complemented by the proposed new law governing the operations of the Amman Financial Market (AFM), which aims at improving and restructuring the operations of the AFM, increasing the number of instruments to be traded, and establishing transparent rules and uniform treatment for all foreign investors. The authorities are favorably considering the recommendation of the World Bank and the USAID to price new issues on the basis of market factors (and not by an issuing committee).

External debt and debt service, debt management policy, arrears, and capacity to repay the Fund Jordan's outstanding external debt declined to 112.4 percent of GDP (USS6.9 billion) by end-1994, and is projected to increase to USs7.5 billion by end-1995 (109.6 percent of GDP), reflecting primarily the effect of the recent depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis other major currencies. In particular, external debt service denominated in Japanese yen--mostly post- cutoff date and thus not subject to rescheduling under the recent Paris Club rescheduling agreement--increased substantially. Debt service to the United States also turned out to be higher than projected earlier, owing to delays in securing congressional approval for the second tranche of the debt reduction announced in 1994. The authorities intend to continue their prudent debt management policy, limiting recourse to commercial and short-term borrowing. However, as shown in the updated medium-term scenario, despite the gains recorded until 1994, both debt and debt service on outstanding debt are higher than envisaged during the second review under the arrangement. This unfavorable development raises concern, as it could offset much of the gain achieved through the remarkable strengthening of the external current account receipts. The authorities have initiated discussions with the Japanese, German, French, and other official bilateral creditors in order to secure possible additional debt and/or debt service relief, including via swaps and buybacks, as well as additional financing on concessional terms. As regards the normalization of payments relations with official bilateral creditors, since the Paris Club rescheduling of June 1994, Jordan has completed 12 bilateral agreements with Paris Club creditors, and significant progress has been made toward concluding the remaining two. As all bilateral agreements with Paris Club creditors could not be completed by end-June 1995, the authorities have requested the Paris Club for a further extension of the deadline for completion of all bilateral agreements to September 30, 1995. The authorities have offered non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors debt service rescheduling on terms comparable to those extended by the Paris Club creditors and progress has been made in concluding agreements with some creditors. However, despite their best efforts and renewed offers, no progress has been made in regularizing payments arrears to some national funds. In these circumstances, and in view of the progress that has been made in reducing external payments arrears and normalizing payments relations, the authorities have requested the Fund's approval for the retention of exchange restrictions evidenced by external payments arrears through December 31, 1995. Despite the larger debt service payments in the updated medium-term projections, conventional indicators relating to Jordan's capacity to repay the Fund are not substantively different from earlier estimates (Appendix I, Tables 12, 13, and 14). Debt service to the Fund would peak at 0.8 percent of exports of goods and services in the year 2000 and Fund credit would decline from 3.7 percent of Jordan's medium- and long-term external debt in 1996 to 1.8 percent in 2002.

EXCeDtiOnal financing needs over the medium term Jordan's economic policies and adjustment efforts are being implemented in an external environment characterized by a weak balance of payments structure, high external debt, and uncertainties regarding regional developments. These factors, coupled with the current low level of gross official reserves --insufficient to cope with a major external shock--have contributed to a decline in the demand for the JD and highlighted the need for a more rapid buildup of gross official reserves. Against this backdrop, two issues are of special concern to the authorities. First, for as long as uncertainties persist regarding future currency arrangements in the WBGS, the risk of a sudden shift out of the JD cannot be ruled out. Earlier this year, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority (PA) signed an agreement that confirms the status of the JD as legal tender in the WBGS, along with other currencies, and precludes any unilateral action by either party that could destabilize monetary conditions. In view of the ongoing trend toward dollarization in the WBGS, the risk of such destabilization would be reduced if Jordan and the PA were to reach an understanding that would ensure an orderly phase-out of the stock of JDs currently in the WBGS (estimated by the CBJ at about US$500 million), but this might not be possible for some time in view of the current legal considerations. u Therefore, while uncertainties remain about the timing and modalities of a redemption of the JDs circulating in the WBGS, a faster and significantly larger build up of gross official reserves than that envisaged under the EFF program would enable Jordan to overcome unfavorable market perceptions in a decisive manner. Since Jordan would not be at present in a position to wholly finance the redemption from its own reserves, the authorities are continuing their efforts to secure resources from foreign donors for the needed additional reserve buildup. Second, Jordan's outstanding external debt and prospective debt-service payments remain excessively high despite progress in reducing them through a comprehensive debt management strategy. Reflecting the structure of its amortization payments, from 1998 onwards Jordan would again need to borrow heavily to achieve even relatively modest growth targets. Moreover, the high external debt might well discourage private investment and foreign u This estimate is highly tentative. However, an amount around this order of magnitude would appear to be consistent with the results of a recent study commissioned by the Palestinian Monetary Authority (PMA), which shows that JD deposits with banks in the WBGS stood at close to the equivalent of US$380 million at end-March 1995. In addition, JD currency in circulation is presently estimated by the PMA and bankers in the WBGS at about US$lOO-150 million, an estimate that appears plausible in view of the traditionally high share of cash in the WBGS.

While pursuing a comprehensive debt restructuring operation--which would be most effective in solving the debt overhang problem--the authorities continue negotiations with official bilateral creditors to secure additional debt relief and/or restructuring, as well as additional financing under concessional terms. IV. Staff Annraisal Building on the progress achieved on the macroeconomic front in recent years, Jordan is continuing with further adjustment in 1995 along the lines envisaged under the EFF. Since the last Article IV consultation, Jordan's macroeconomic performance has been impressive: firm demand-management policies, contributing to lower imports, together with strong export performance, have helped to sharply reduce the external current account deficit. The corresponding lower foreign savings are being offset by increased domestic savings, allowing for higher domestic private sector investment than envisaged under the program. Economic growth and inflation performance are also expected to be better than programmed. Notwithstanding the improvements in the general macroeconomic conditions, in the short term Jordan has been facing two problems: a deterioration in the fiscal outlook for 1995, primarily due to larger interest payments on foreign debt and larger food subsidies on account of higher world prices; and the continuing low level of gross official reserves, reflecting shortfalls in the disbursement of external financing and the private sector's continued preference for holding foreign assets, due to market perceptions about the possible costs of the redemption of JDs circulating in the WBGS. Over the medium term, despite the registered stronger external current account adjustment, high debt and debt-service payments would hinder external viability even with relatively modest growth targets. If not addressed, these developments could undermine the social and political support for the adjustment and structural reform efforts needed if Jordan is to benefit from the new opportunities in the region. The authorities' commitment to restore the pace of fiscal consolidation is welcome. Although the revised fiscal deficit target for 1995 is somewhat higher than initially programmed, the primary balance is now projected to be better than the initial program target. The corrective fiscal measures-- particularly increasing the basic GST rate and reducing subsidies--will help alleviate the excessive vulnerability of central government revenue and expenditure to exogenous developments, but vulnerability will persist unless fundamental reforms in the operations of the generalized food subsidy program and civil service are undertaken. In this regard, the staff welcomes the authorities' intention to replace remaining generalized food subsidies by an arrangement to pass on increased costs to consumers in a timely manner, while protecting the low-income groups through direct income transfers. The planned implementation of such a reform by end-1995 would contribute greatly to the attainment of the 1996 fiscal targets. Over the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - medium term, a more ambitious fiscal consolidation effort, with the concomitant increase in public savings, would also assist Jordan in meeting the challenges ahead. In spite of the significant strengthening of the external current account position, Jordan's external situation remains fragile. It is therefore appropriate that the authorities intend to continue maintaining sufficiently high differentials in favor of JD-denominated assets. For the targeted recovery of gross foreign exchange reserves in the second half of 1995 to materialize, the CBJ should stand ready to act promptly. In this regard, the staff welcomes the authorities' commitment to closely monitor developments in foreign exchange reserves and, if needed, take steps to further increase interest rate differentials vis-a-vis U.S. dollar- denominated assets. The staff endorses the CBJ's policy of fully backing, commercial banks' reserves on foreign deposits, which has served well to increase market confidence. In addition, the staff would stress the desirability of removing structural biases against JD-denominated deposits. Exchange rate policy will continue to maintain the peg of the JD vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, which remains appropriate given Jordan's competitiveness, the strong performance of current account receipts, and the need to attract foreign inflows. In view of the low level of gross official reserves, the authorities remain concerned about the possible re-emergence of external pressures, particularly those associated with expectations regarding the eventual redemption of JDs currently in the West Bank. A faster buildup of foreign exchange reserves to a level higher than contemplated in the EFF program would constitute an additional safeguard, and would contribute to minimize downside risks. Given the strong domestic policy stance, the staff supports the authorities' efforts to seek additional foreign assistance to increase Jordan's foreign exchange reserves-- including a provision for an eventual redemption of JDs circulating in the WBGS- -since such a reserve buildup would contribute to reassure the markets and minimize the risk of disruptions to the adjustment and reform program. Structural reform efforts have regained momentum with the formulation of a comprehensive package of structural reforms geared to open up the economy and rationalize the incentive structure for the private sector. The staff welcomes the intended reforms, which are consistent with the authorities' medium-term private sector and export-led strategy, and should effectively promote increasingly higher domestic and foreign private investment. At the same time, there is scope for further improvements, and the authorities are encouraged to persevere in their efforts, especially as regards trade liberalization. An intensification of those efforts is also needed to accelerate the disbursement of external financing. In particular, it is important for Jordan to reach timely agreement with the World Bank on the reforms supported by the ESAL second tranche and the TPAL, in light of the size of the balance of payments support involved.

Following the Paris Club rescheduling agreement in June 1994, Jordan has completed 12 bilateral agreements with official bilateral creditors, and the remaining two bilateral agreements are expected to be concluded soon. Since all bilateral agreements with Paris Club creditors could not be completed by end-June 1995, the authorities have requested the Paris Club to extend the deadline for completion of all bilateral agreements to September 30, 1995. Jordan has also offered non- Paris Club official bilateral creditors debt-service rescheduling on terms comparable to those extended by Paris Club creditors. Nevertheless, despite renewed and best efforts in seeking debt relief from non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors on terms comparable to those obtained from Paris Club creditors, arrears to some non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors still persist, giving rise to an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. In view of the substantial progress made in reducing external payments arrears and the authorities' intensified efforts to clear the remaining arrears by end-December 1995, the staff recommends an approval for the retention of the exchange restriction evidenced by certain external debt service payments until December 31, 1995 or completion of the fourth review under the extended arrangement, whichever is earlier. The staff urges the authorities to settle the remaining payments arrears expeditiously. From 1998 onwards, Jordan would again need to borrow heavily to meet debt service obligations, even allowing for relatively unambitious growth targets. There is concern that, even with continuing strong economic policies, the external debt situation would tend to inhibit private capital formation and foreign investment inflows, thereby weakening further the outlook for growth, and creating the prospect of perpetuating dependence on exceptional financing. A comprehensive debt restructuring operation, bringing about a substantial and permanent reduction in debt-service payments, would be most effective in solving the debt overhang problem. At present, the authorities are pursuing their efforts with creditors bilaterally, in order to obtain further debt restructuring/relief and additional financing under concessional terms with a view to improving the prospects for medium-term viability. A solution to this problem, to bolster continued determined policy implementation by the authorities, would leave Jordan better positioned to benefit from the new climate in the Middle East. It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

The Fund takes this decision relating to Jordan's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Section 2, in the light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Jordan conducted under Decision No. 5392- (77/63) adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance Over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Jordan retains, as described in EBS/95/140, an exchange restriction evidenced by arrears on certain external debt-service payments that is subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). The Fund welcomes the authorities' intention to eliminate all external payments arrears by December 31, 1995. In the circumstances of Jordan, the Fund grants approval for the retention of this restriction until December 31, 1995, or the completion of the fourth review under the extended arrangement, whichever is earlier. B. Third Review Under the Extended Arrangement 1. Jordan has consulted with the Fund in accordance with paragraph 3 of the extended arrangement for Jordan (EBS/94/74, Sup. 1) and paragraph 30 of the Memorandum on Economic Policy of the Government of Jordan attached to the letter dated April 5, 1994 from the Minister of Finance and Customs and the Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan, in order to review progress made in the implementation of the policies and measures described in that letter and annexed Memorandum on Economic Policy of the Government of Jordan.

They will be adjusted downward for any buybacke of official external debt. In view of the unusually high degree of uncertainty surrounding potential changes in the NIR resulting from the currency and banking arrangements with the West Bank and Plaza Strip (WBGS), appropriate modifications could be made at the time of reviews.

Use of Fund Resources Jordan made reserve tranche purchases of SDR 16.6 million in June 1983 and of SDR 7.2 million in May 1984. A compensatory financing purchase of SDR 57.4 million was made in January 1985; this amount has been repurchased in full. Purchases under the compensatory and contingency financing facility were made on July 19, 1989 (SDR 16.7 million) and on August 23, 1989 (SDR 22.8 million). Both purchases were in respect of the compensatory financing of export fluctuations. Purchases under an 18-month SBA in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - APPENDIX III amount of SDR 60.0 million were made on July 19, 1989 (SDR 18.5 million) and on December 29, 1989 (SDR 8.3 million). Under the last SBA, Jordan has made purchases of SDR 7.4 million each on March 2, 1992, June 26, 1992, September 1, 1992, and January 4, 1993, respectively, of SDR 3.7 million on February 16, 1993, and of SDR 11.1 million on February 18, 1994. Under the current three-year EFF, Jordan made two purchases of SDR 9.8 million each on May 31, 1994 and August 8, 1994, one purchase of SDR 12.5 million on September 19, 1994, one purchase of SDR 22.3 million on December 2, 1994, and one purchase of SDR 22 million on February 16, 1995. Nonfinancial Relations VIII. Exchange System On February 15, 1975, the Jordan dinar was pegged officially to the SDR at the rate of JD 1 = SDR 2.5790 with margins of 2.25 percent. However, from 1984 until 1988, the exchange rate was allowed to move within a wider margin, with a view to effecting a gradual depreciation in real effective terms. Moreover, in 1986 commercial banks were allowed to quote their own rates using the central bank rate as a guide. The dinar came under increasing pressure in 1988, and was allowed to float in October 1988. On February 8, 1989, the CBJ unified the central bank and commercial bank rates at JD 1 - USS1.852. In late May 1989, the dinar was pegged to a basket comprising the five currencies of the SDR basket with the weight of each of these currencies reflecting its importance in Jordan's external transactions. The dual exchange rate system was formally established on July 31, 1989 at which time the official rate (applying to Central Bank and about 15 percent of commercial bank transactions) was JD 1 = USS1.726 and the commercial bank rate (applying to all other transactions of the commercial banks) was JD 1 - USS1.124. On February 17, 1990 the official and commercial bank rates were unified at JD 1 - USS1.486. Following the start of the regional crisis in August 1990, a parallel market rate emerged, which in November 1990 was nearly 10 percent more depreciated than the official rate. The parallel rate disappeared shortly following the end of the crisis in 1991. At end-May 1995, the exchange rate was JD 1 = USS1.4390. IX. Article IV Consultation Jordan is on the standard 12-month cycle. The 1994 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on May 25, 1994. The Executive Board's decision was as follows: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Jordan's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Section 2, in concluding the 1994 Article XIV consultation with Jordan and in the light of the 1994 Article IV consultation with Jordan conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance Over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Jordan retains, as described in EBS/94/74, Supplement 1, an exchange restriction evidenced by arrears on certain external debt service Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - APPENDIX III payments that is subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). The Fund welcomes the authorities' intention to eliminate all external payments arrears by September 30, 1994. In the circumstances of Jordan, the Fund grants approval for the retention of this restriction until September 30, 1994, or the completion of the first review under the extended arrangement, whichever is earlier. X. Technical Assistance During the last several years, extensive technical assistance has been provided to Jordan. This included assistance in the use of computing facilities by the Bureau of Computing Services (BCS) that fielded missions for that purpose in 1985, 1988, and 1990. Similarly, FAD has provided technical assistance in the areas of financial reporting, sales taxation, procedures for budget preparation and execution, and reform of the tax system. This assistance took the form of several staff missions and the assignment of experts. In addition, a staff member of the Statistics Department (STA) visited Jordan in 1987 to assist the authorities in reviewing the national accounts methodology. Since the adoption of a Fund-supported adjustment program in 1989, technical assistance provided by the Fund has been concentrated in the areas of tax reform and financial sector reform. A FAD mission visited Amman in July 1989 to make recommendations regarding the reform of the tax system, particularly with respect to improving its elasticity; the mission's final report was submitted to the authorities in November 1989. The authorities also requested technical assistance from the Fund to help in laying the groundwork for the introduction of a general sales tax, and fiscal missions visited Amman in June 1990, May 1992, September 1993, February 1994, and June 1994 for that purpose. Peripatetic technical assistance was provided by FAD through Spring 1995 regarding the implementation and improvement of the GST system. In June 1994, a fiscal mission visited Amman to make recommendations on income tax reform and synchronization of customs duties with the general sales tax that was introduced on June 1, 1994. A fiscal mission also visited Amman in September 1994 to provide technical assistance on social safety net options and budgetary implications. A mission from BCS visited Amman in June 1990 and made recommendations regarding the computerization of external debt statistics. A mission from MAE visited Amman in July 1993 and made recommendations to improve the operations of monetary control. A follow-up mission from MAE visited Amman in May 1994 to assist the authorities in their move to reliance upon indirect instrument of monetary control; this visit was timed to coincide with the short-term assignment (one month) of an MAE expert on monetary operations. In August/September 1993, a staff team from the Middle Eastern and STA Departments visited Amman and made recommendations on the reporting and compilation of monetary statistics with proper sectorization/classification of financial accounts.

All the credits and 26 of the loans have been fully disbursed. Project implemen- tation and disbursement performance have been satisfactory and are generally higher than the average for the Middle East and North Africa region. The IFC has made loans and equity investments in Jordan with total commitments of US$143 million, including about US$SO million in syndications. In the postregional crisis era, the most important medium-term objective of the World Bank has been to assist the Government in launching the country on a sustainable growth path, while helping it to restore the country's creditworthiness. This objective has been pursued through a series of policy-based adjustment loans to support structural reforms in Industry and Trade (US$lSO million, completed in 1992), Energy (US$80 million, approved in October 1993) and Agriculture (US$80 million, approved in May, 1995). Parallel to the IMP's SBA, the Government has already implemented a number of steps associated with time-bound action programs for the operations in Industry and Trade and in Energy. Future action programs in trade, finance, and the regulatory environment are under discussion. The World Bank is seeking appropriate external financing in support of the adjustment and structural reform programs. The World Bank will continue to address critical physical and policy constraints through investment projects in transport (approved in FY93), w telecommunications (FY94), export development (FY96), power (FY96), tourism (FY97), and water supply (FY97); and implement a development strategy for the social sectors with projects aimed at improving the quality of, and access to, health (approved in FY93) and education (FY95). Its support for direct interventions for poverty alleviation and employment generation is being pursued through appropriate links between the private sector development and social sector strategies. Provided the Government's adjustment and reform programs stay on track, and in view of prudent exposure limits, the World Bank expects to be able to commit approximately US$400 million in new lending to Jordan during FY96-98. In support of the Government's efforts to mobilize the required external financing, Consultative Group (CG) meetings were convened in January 1993 and May 1994. The response of the donor countries to Jordan's adjustment and reform efforts was generally positive, and the gaps for 1993 and 1994 were effectively closed. In view of the external debt burden, the resulting uncertainties regarding needed exceptional financing and the vulnerability of the balance of payments to external shocks (including currency substitution/redemption of Jordan dinars in the West Bank) a third 1/ Prepared by World Bank staff. u FY refers to the World Bank's fiscal year.

The World Bank's economic and sector work provides analytical support for the adjustment and reform programs implemented by, or under discussion with, the Government. A Country Economic Memorandum covering the financial sector, external debt, trade incentives, public sector involvement in the economy, and the labor market, and separate reports on the impact on Jordan of the Middle East peace process and a Poverty Assessment were completed in 1994. A water sector review, a private sector assessment, and an analysis of women in the labor force are under discussion with the Government. An analysis of trade policy vis-8-vis the European Union will begin in F'Y96.

Real sector The Fund's Statistics Department is investigating the possibility of: including a quarterly wholesale price index on the IFS page for Jordan which is now available on a regular basis. The base period for the reported data on industrial production (code 66.. .xb) was changed from 1979 to 1980 without overlap period, which precludes the compilation of historical data before 1980. The national accounts data are reported on a regular basis. The trade price and volume indices have been reported on a regular basis, however for 1994, annual data were provided without the corresponding quarterly figures. 2. Government finance The latest yearly data reported for publication in GFSY are for 1993 and cover budgetary operations of the central government. There are discrepancies between revenue, grants, expenditure, and lending minus repayments data reported to GFSY and to MED that seem to be only partially explained by the difference in coverage and recording basis. Moreover, there are differences in classification between data reported to STA and to MED. 3. Monetary accounts Consistent monetary data for the central bank and the deposit money banks are reported on a regular basis. Revised report forms 10R and 20R reflect revisions in the classification of the accounts of the Central Bank and the deposit money banks recommended by the STA money and banking statistics mission of August 1993. Data for the specialized credit institutions, with the necessary breakdown of deposits by maturity and transactors, beginning December 1993 were recently reported to STA. 4.

Jordan's macroeconomic performance and policy implementation under the extended arrangement approved by the Executive Board on May 25, 1994, continue to be broadly in line with program expectations. Real economic growth (6.2 percent), inflation (less than 4 percent), and external current account adjustment are expected to be better than the program targets for 1995. The external current account deficit was sharply reduced in 1994 (to 6.5 percent of GDP, versus a target of 8.8 percent)--as a result of a strong performance of merchandise exports, tourism and remittances and of lower imports, and is projected to be reduced further in 1995, by 1.5 percentage points to 5 percent of GDP. The composition of imports has also shifted markedly in favor of industrial raw materials and capital equipment, allowing for continued economic expansion with lower imports. However, the developments on the import side have resulted in lower tax revenue which, combined with higher external interest payments and other recurrent expenditures, have made the attainment of the fiscal targets for both 1994 and 1995 difficult. 2. Monetary policy continues to be guided by the objective of maintaining domestic price stability and the attractiveness of holding Jordan dinars (JD) while supporting nominal exchange rate stability, which has led to improved external competitiveness. To achieve the targeted buildup of gross official reserves (i.e., readily usable foreign exchange reserves), the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) has been maintaining domestic interest rates at competitive levels with foreign interest rates. Currently, the interest rate differentials in favor of JD-denominated assets (vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar-denominated assets of similar maturity) are about 2.7-2.9 percentage points. Reflecting the high interest rates, monetary expansion was limited to 8 percent in 1994 (compared with a 10 percent growth in nominal GDP), and decelerated further during the first four months of 1995. Nevertheless, due to large shortfalls in external aid disbursements and continued uncertainty about the JD-holdings in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the level of gross official reserves remains low: at US$420 million (1.3 months of imports) as of mid-June 1995, they were substantially below the program target for end-1995. With continued tight liquidity of the domestic banking system, the expected seasonal increase in inflows of workers' remittances and resumption of external financing disbursements, a significant turnaround in the gross official reserve position is expected to take place during the remainder of 1995. 3. The Government remains committed to achieving the gross official reserve target for end-December 1995 of about US$600 million (2 months of imports) and to sustaining the pace of reserve accumulation in the medium Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 46 - APPENDI:= term as envisaged in its medium-term macroeconomic framework (Attachment I). To achieve this objective, the CBJ intends to continue to monitor closely developments in foreign exchange reserves while maintaining nominal exchange rate stability vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. Interest rates will be maintained at appropriate levels in order to ensure the attractiveness of JD- denominated assets. If needed, the CBJ will further increase interest rate differentials vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar-denominated assets through sale of JD-denominated certificates of deposits. Accordingly, overall money supply is programmed to be limited to 9.7 percent in 1995, in line with the perceived lower demand for the JD and compared with a projected nominal GDP expansion of 10.8 percent. On this basis, quarterly ceilings and floors have been established for end-September and end-December 1995 on the net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBJ and the net claims on the public sector by the domestic banking system, in combination with the indicative targets for reserve money (Attachment II), and for net international reserves (NIR) (Attachment III), respectively. Consistent with the current stance of macroeconomic policies and the reduction of the external current account deficit, the Government intends to continue with the policy of maintaining nominal exchange rate stability. 4. Notwithstanding the fiscal slippage in 1994, the Government also remains committed to further fiscal consolidation. Accordingly, the over.all fiscal deficit (excluding foreign grants) will be reduced to 4.6 percent of GDP in 1995, compared with an initial program target of 4.3 percent of GDP. As a result of higher interest payments on foreign debt (by 1.1 percentage points of GDP, reflecting the appreciation of the yen and higher world interest rates), higher cost of food subsidies, and lower revenues from customs duty, the overall fiscal deficit would have increased to 5.2 percent of GDP under unchanged policies. In order to limit the fiscal deficit to the program level, the Government: (i) has already increased the price of barley and other animal feed by an average of 21 percent; and (ii) intends to increase the basic GST rate by 3 percentage points to 10 percent, raise license fees for cars, adjust customs duties on iron bars, and reduce recurrent outlays on goods and services. The combined effect of these measures are projected to yield JD 28 million (0.6 percent of GDP) in 199s. The Government is also considering a reform of the current wheat subsidy system, with a view to reducing the fiscal cost through better targeting, and pursue its efforts at civil service reform. 5. In line with its earlier commitments, the Government intends to improve the functioning of the general sales tax (GST) system and to reform the direct tax system. The draft laws have been discussed with the private sector and submitted to Parliament for its consideration in the current session. The proposed amendments to the GST system include: (i) a negative list of exempted services, instead of a positive list for taxable services; (ii) the provision of voluntary registration; and (iii) the provision for imposing supplementary excise duty on selected luxury and socially undesirable products at both the import and the domestic manufacturing stages, with a view to protecting fiscal revenues in light of the prospective reduction of customs duties envisaged under the external tariff reform (see below). The Government also has submitted to Parliament a new Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 47 - income tax law whose main features are: (i) elimination of tax holidays, except for investments made in under-developed areas; (ii) reduction of the maximum tax rate to 30 percent (from 45 percent); (iii) broadening of the direct tax base through reduction and simplification of exemptions and applying uniform standard deductions for all wage earners; and (iv) interest payments deductible net of interest earned. 6. With the steady strengthening of indirect monetary control operations, the CBJ has eliminated the credit to deposit ratio in February 1995. The CBJ also excluded interbank deposits and borrowings denominated in JD from the base subject to JD reserve requirement, to promote the development of the interbank market. While liquidity ratios are being maintained on prudential grounds, these ratios are no longer considered as monetary control instruments. To strengthen further the banking prudential framework, the CBJ increased the minimum paid-up capital of all Jordanian licensed banks (to JD 10 million by end-1995 and further to JD 20 million by end-1996); imposed a 10 percent reserve requirement on customers' deposits and borrowings denominated in JD for branches operating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS); and set tighter standards aimed at reducing the risks of banks arising from their single credit exposure. The CBJ also intends to undertake a study relating to the operation of the foreign exchange interbank market. Further initiatives are being considered to enhance the efficiency of the financial system and to deepen financial intermediation. 7. As part of its ongoing liberalization of the exchange system, Jordan accepted the obligations under the Fund's Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4 effective February 20, 1995. Following the Paris Club rescheduling of June 1994, the Government has completed 12 bilateral agreements with Paris Club official bilateral creditors, Since all bilateral agreements with Paris Club creditors could not be completed by end-June 1995, the Government has requested the Paris Club for an extension of the bilateral deadline to September 30, 1995. Progress has also been made toward concluding the bilateral agreements with some non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors. The existence of restrictions evidenced by the remaining arrears vis-a-vis some national development funds is the only restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. The Government has been offering to negotiate debt rescheduling on terms comparable to those extended by the Paris Club official bilateral creditors, but despite its best efforts and renewed offers no progress has been made thus far in regularizing these payments arrears. Under these circumstances and taking into account the significant progress that has been made in reducing external payments arrears and normalizing payments relations, the Government would like to request the Fund's approval for the retention of external payments arrears through December 31, 1995, while it continues to make its best efforts to resolve this issue. 8. In addition to the fiscal reforms outlined above, preparations are well underway to secure legislative approval for structural reforms in a number of other areas aimed at opening up the economy and financial markets and establishing a stable and predictable regulatory environment. Following the first stage of customs tariff reform implemented in November 1994, the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 4.8 - APPENDIXJ Government will formulate, by August 1995, an action plan for further reform of the tariff regime. The elements of the action plan for implementation in 1995 include: simplification of the customs tariff structure by combining the existing numerous fees and charges into one consolidated tariff structure; a significant reduction of the number of tariff rates; reduction of nontariff barriers through elimination of import licensing requirements and import monopolies; and a further reduction of the maximum effective customs duty from 70 percent currently (except for three categories of products), consistent with the commitments in the Government's letter of December 31, 1994. These reforms are to be supported by the World Bank's proposed Trade Sector Adjustment Loan (TSAL) and Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL). 9. The Government has submitted legislation related to reforming the laws governing domestic and foreign investment and the associated incentive structure to Parliament for its consideration during its current session. The draft investment law allows for equal treatment for all investors, and aims at rationalizing the incentive structure and opening the financial market to all foreign investors. This investment law is to be complemented by the proposed draft direct income tax law, the tariff reform program, and the law governing the operations of the Amman Financial Market (AFM). The draft AFM law would aim at improving the operations of the AFM, increasing the number of instruments to be traded on the market, pricing the new issues based on market mechanism, and restructuring the AM. After consideration of all associated technical issues, the AFM law is to be submitted to Parliament in late 1995. The Government also intends to continue the reforms initiated in the energy sector under the World Bank's Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (ESAL), and the sales of public shares in several companies while promoting commercialization of state-owned companies prior to their privatization. Moreover, the Government will shortly begin discussions on a bilateral agreement with the European Union and on membership in the World Trade Organization. 10. The Government considers that ear'ly implementation of the structural reform package, consisting of the key legislation described above, would constitute a major step toward further opening up Jordan's economy, improving allocational efficiency, and enhancing the prospects for attracting higher private sector domestic and foreign investment. The Government expects that most legislation will be enacted and implemented by the time of the forthcoming Amman Economic Summit in late October 1995. The Government also reiterates its resolve to pursue the necessary structural Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 49 - APPENDIX VI reforms consistent with its medium-term private sector and export-led program strategy to achieve sustained economic growth with price stability and to generate employment.

In the event such receipts fall short of the program assumption, the quarterly ceilings will be reviewed taking into account all relevant factors.
