Introduction A staff team visited Almaty during October 25-November 8, 1995 to conduct the 1995 Article IV discussions and undertake the mid-term review under the current stand-by arrangement. u The mission also held initial discussions for a medium-term program covering 1996-98, that could be supported by an arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The mission met with President Nazarbayev, Prime Minister Kazhegeldin, Deputy Prime Minister Sobolev, National Bank of Kazakstan (NBK) Chairman Sembayev, Finance Minister Pavlov, and other senior officials. A twelve month stand-by arrangement for Kazakstan, in an amount equivalent to SDR 185.6 million (75 percent of quota), was approved by the Executive Board on June 5, 1995. The first purchase of SDR 46.61 million (18.75 percent of quota) was made following Board approval, and the second purchase (also of SDR 46.61 million) was made in September 1995, following the granting of a waiver by the Executive Board for the non-observance of the performance criterion on the non-accumulation of arrears on external debt service payments. In a letter dated November 24, 1995 (EBS/95/206 and Correction l), the authorities describe the policies they intend to pursue for the remainder of the program period, and request a further waiver for the non-observance of the performance criterion relating to the non- accumulation of arrears on external debt service payments (all other performance criteria having been met). Following completion of this review and the granting of a waiver, Kazakstan would be able to make a third purchase of SDR 46.61 million (18.75 percent of quota). As of November 30, 1995, Kazakstan's outstanding use of Fund credit amounted to SDR 291 million, equivalent to 117.5 percent of quota. Relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendix II and Appendix III, respectively. At the conclusion of the last Article IV Consultation in November 1994, Executive Directors welcomed the progress made toward financial stabilization in the second half of 1994, but observed that the rate of inflation was still too high. Directors also stressed that the authorities had not moved strongly enough to impose financial discipline on, or restructure, the state enterprise sector, and cautioned that sustainable progress in macro stabilization would be jeopardized unless the momentum of enterprise restructuring was accelerated. At the same time, Directors welcomed the substantial progress toward price and trade liberalization. u Consisting of Mr. Donovan (head), Ms. Nagy, Mr. De Broeck, Ms. Kostial (EP--all EUR II), Messrs.

Key economic data are made available in a timely fashion. However, significant statistical problems remain, especially in the areas of national accounts and balance of payments statistics, that impair economic analysis and the monitoring of economic developments. Extensive technical assistance in the statistical area has been provided and further assistance is planned. The authorities have generally been receptive to recommendations to upgrade the quality of the statistical system to international standards. II. Overview and Performance Under the 1995 Program 1. DeveloDments in 1993-94 Since 1993, the Government of Kazakstan has embarked on an ambitious strategy of financial stabilization and systemic reforms, supported by three consecutive financial arrangements from the Fund. A purchase under the Systemic Transformation Facility (STF) was approved in July 1993, followed by two stand-by arrangements approved in January 1994 and June 1995. Overall, during 1993-94, significant progress was achieved despite difficulties associated, first, with membership in the ruble area, and, second, following monetary independence in late 1993, with the stop-and-go nature of financial policies, particularly in the first half of 1994. The monthly inflation rate was reduced from an average of 30 percent in 1993 to 10 percent in December 1994 (Chart 1). At the same time, price liberalization was almost completed, most of the restrictions on foreign trade were eliminated, and privatization was commenced. Since November 1993, Kazakstan has maintained a unified exchange system. Institution building also advanced. The NBK moved progressively toward a greater degree of independence; state orders were eliminated; and major changes in the legal system were adopted. However, progress on the structural front, notably as regards the enterprise sector, typically lagged, which tended to undermine the gains achieved in macro- stabilization. u L/ Developments in 1994 are described in detail in EBS/95/78.

Developments under the 1995 orogram The program for 1995 aimed at achieving a sharp and rapid reduction in inflation via a major tightening in fiscal and monetary policy, supported by accelerated structural reforms. Monthly inflation was targeted to fall from 10 percent at end-1994 to l-l l/2 percent by end-1995; the fiscal deficit was to be virtually halved from 6 3/4 percent of GDP in 1994 to 3 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995; and the external current account deficit was to be reduced slightly, from over 8 percent of GDP in 1994 to around 7 percent of GDP in 1995 (Table 1). The program also aimed at completing the second stage of privatization and speeding up enterprise restructuring. a. Inflation, output. emolovment and wages Monthly inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from 10 percent in December 1994 to 5 percent by March 1995 and, in the following six months, fluctuated between 2 and 3 percent. However, prices rose by 4.1 percent in October and by 4.4 percent in November, reflecting a combination of seasonal factors, adjustments in administered prices, and the lagged effect of significant base money growth during June-July. Officially recorded outout declined by about 11 percent in the first nine months Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 4- of 1995, compared to the corresponding period of 1994 (Table 1). 1/ While industrial production broadly stabilized, output in the agricultural, construction, and transport and communications sectors continued to contract. Partly due to financial problems and lack of fertilizers and equipment, the 1995 grain harvest is estimated to have been one third lower than in 1994. Recorded emolovment as of end-September 1995 was about 13 percent less than a year ago. Officially registered unemployment has increased only moderately, to about 2 percent of the labor force; however, using the IL0 definition, the unemployment rate is currently around 6 percent, while broader measures, which take into account workers on part-time employment or on involuntary leave, point to a rate closer to 12 percent. During January- September 1995 real wages were around 10 percent higher compared to one year earlier, roughly 20 percent above the program level; the monthly wage averaged about US$75. b. Fiscal develoDments The fiscal outcome during the first nine months of 1995 was markedly tighter than planned (Tables 2 and 3, and Chart 2). The overall cash deficit of the General Government amounted to only 0.3 percent of GDP compared to 2.4 percent of GDP under the program. While regular budgetary operations recorded a much smaller-than-expected deficit, the surplus on quasi-fiscal operations was less than the program target due to a lower level of payments by enterprises in respect of arrears to the budget. Overall, extrabudgetary funds remained in slight surplus through the first nine months of 1995, as a continued sizable surplus recorded by the Road Fund more than offset small deficits incurred by the Pension and Employment Funds. The lower deficit on regular operations largely reflected a squeeze on cash expenditures which led, in turn, to an accumulation of domestic arrears (mainly in respect of wages and utility bills) and external debt service arrears, together amounting to about 2 percent of GDP. Revenue collections amounted to almost 15 percent of GDP in the first nine months of 1995, in line with the program target. Tax collections were buoyed by good performance on VAT, export duties, and Investment Fund contributions; however, there were disappointing yields from natural resource and property taxation. Total nontax revenues were broadly on- track, while proceeds from privatization were much lower than budgeted. The compression of cash expenditures (to about 16 l/2 percent of GDP compared to the program target of 18.7 percent) was associated with a strict sequestration policy mainly directed at restraining spending on the "national economy" rincipally subsidies and operation and maintenance outlays), defense, L!d to some extent * social safety net outlays. u As in other transition economies, official statistics do not capture a substantial part of emerging private sector activity, especially in the services sector.

These bonds, the value of which totalled about Tenge 13 billion, (equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP), were partially settled in the third quarter of 1995 via: (i) direct cash payments of about Tenge 1.2 billion (in respect of individual claims up to Tenge 1 million); (ii) a direct offset against tax and other budgetary obligations of Tenge 4.8 billion; and (iii) the issuance of non-interest bearing debt instruments (KOs) in an amount of Tenge 3.5 billion, to be redeemed by end-year. u Consideration is being given to redeeming the remaining dollar-indexed bonds (about Tenge 3.5 billion) by the issuance of one-year Treasury bills at market rates in January 1996. Net foreign financing of the budget was the equivalent of 1.9 percent of GDP during the first nine months of the year, compared to a program projection of 3.4 percent of GDP, owing to lower official disbursements as well as a more appreciated exchange rate for the Tenge. Net financing from the banking system was actually negative (to an amount of 1.5 percent of GDP), reflecting a substantial buildup of government deposits, including in foreign exchange. Sales of Treasury bills increased rapidly, reaching 0.3 percent of GDP, but were held almost entirely by the banking sector, including the NBK. Nonbank domestic financing was also negative, reflecting the net impact of the partial redemption of the dollar-indexed bonds. C. Monetary and exchange rate policies Performance with respect to the program's financial policies has been satisfactory, and all performance criteria for the net domestic assets (NDA) and the net international reserves (NIR) of the NBK, as well as for net credit to the Government and to the budget from the banking system, were met for end-June and end-September by large margins (Appendix 1 and Table 4). Although domestic credit expansion was much slower than programmed, a sharp and unexpected surge in NIR led to rates of monetary expansion that were more than twice as rapid as anticipated (Chart 3, upper panel). 2 Nevertheless, during this period, prices rose by 42 percent, only slightly higher than the program target of 36 percent, implying an outturn for income velocity about 25 percent lower than envisaged (Chart 3, middle panel). The increased demand for the Tenge can be attributed to relatively stable exchange rates throughout most of the period and the persistence of high real interest rates, and an associated increase in financial confidence. 1/ These KOs are used to settle tax and tax arrears payments as well as utility bills among enterprises. u This contrasts with developments under the 1994 program, when most of the base money increase resulted from an expansion in the NDA of the NBK (mainly stemming from net credit to the Government).

During January-June, the NBK increased its NIR by US$289 million, compared to a targeted accumulation of US$78 million. The larger-than-expected build-up of NIR did not lead to excessive monetary growth through end-May (base money increased at a monthly average rate of 3.4 percent) as the rate of domestic credit expansion was much lower than programmed. However, in the following six weeks of June and July, in the face of large scale foreign exchange inflows (partly relating to an unexpected improvement in the current account as well to foreign management contracts-- Section 11.3), the NBK's NIR rose sharply, as the authorities intervened, so that the nominal exchange rate continued to depreciate. Thus, despite stepped up sterilization operations by the NBK (via the sale of short-term NBK notes), base money expanded by 17 and 16 percent in June and July, respectively. By mid-July, the authorities had come to the view that the sharp increase in base money was likely to lead to an upsurge in inflation, and adjusted exchange rate policy to place greater emphasis on base money targeting. This involved limiting foreign exchange purchases by the NBK to an amount commensurate with sales of NBK notes; the remaining market pressures would be reflected in an appreciation of the Tenge. The NBK also temporarily suspended credit auctions and reduced gradually its refinance rate. Following this policy shift, the exchange rate of the Tenge rose from 62 per U.S. dollar in mid-July to below 55 per U.S. dollar during the first 10 days of August. At that point, market sentiment switched. The supply of foreign exchange dwindled, reflecting the perception that the Tenge had become overvalued, while the demand for foreign currency intensified as imports rebounded; as a result, the exchange rate depreciated to slightly over Tenge 61 per U.S. dollar by end-September. The combined effect of the authorities' policy switch was to restrain the cumulative increase in base money to only 1 percent during August-September, far lower, indeed, than the limit of 6 percent the authorities had set in discussions with the staff. u Between end-September and end-November, the Tenge depreciated slightly, by about 5 percent. Between end-December 1994 and end-October 1995, despite a nominal depreciation of 16 percent, the real exchange rate of the Tenge vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar appreciated by some 20 percent, reflecting the relatively higher rate of inflation in Kazakstan (Charts 4 and 5). In contrast, during the same period, the real exchange rate vis-a-vis the Russian ruble depreciated by 25 percent. Overall, the real effective exchange rate during January-October depreciated by about 5 percent. In tandem with the decline in inflation, the NBK refinance rate was reduced from 230 percent per annum in December 1994 (equivalent to a monthly u As described in EBS/95/147. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - . rate of 13.6 percent) to 95 percent by end-May 1995 (a monthly rate of 6.7 percent); the real refinance rate remained strongly positive, at around 3 percent per month throughout this period (Chart 3, lower panel). With a continued fall in inflation, and partly in response to a surge in capital inflows from May onwards, the refinance rate was reduced further to 45 percent by early September (a monthly rate of 3.4 percent); the real rate declined to 1 percent. Following the pickup in inflation in October and November, and in the face of a widening gap vis-a-vis the (typically higher) credit auction rate, the NBK raised the refinance rate to 53 percent in mid- November, a level implying an approximately zero real rate. d. External sector develonments During the first three quarters of 1995, the current account of the balance of payments registered an estimated deficit of about US$420 million (3.2 percent of GDP) as against a programmed deficit of 6.6 percent of GDP (Table 5). The outcome reflected both a better-than-expected export performance, mainly due to higher world prices, especially for non-ferrous metals, and sluggish import growth as a result of the continuing fall in output and incomes. The capital account surplus (including errors and omissions) of about US$840 million also exceeded the programmed level, as a shortfall in official financing was more than offset by higher than envisaged foreign direct investment. An overall balance of payments surnlus of US$421 million was recorded compared to a programmed deficit of US$453 million. All performance criteria relating to external debt were observed. However, during 1995, as described in Section III, external payments arrears were accumulated. Kazakstan's stock of external debt (including Fund credit and debt owed to Russia) was estimated at USS3.3 billion as of end- September 1995, of which USS1.4 billion was owed to Russia. 3. Structural reforms Progress under the program with respect to structural policies has been mixed, despite the authorities' formal adherence to most specific structural benchmarks (see Appendix I), Price liberalization was largely completed in early 1995 through the liberalization of domestic energy prices, including the abolition of profit margin limits. Trade liberalization was further deepened through the elimination in early 1995 of export quotas and export and import licenses, except in respect of a short negative list and, in August 1995, of the compulsory export surrender requirement. In January 1995, Belarus, Kazakstan and Russia agreed to form a customs union, and in early October 1995, Kazakstan's external tariff structure was modified to align it with that of the other members (see Box 1). In contrast, implementation of the Government's enternrise privatization/restructuring program during 1995 generally proceeded more slowly than planned.

Changes in Kazakstan’s EXDOB~S Duties and Imwrt Tariffs Followiw Aweement on a Customs Union Between Belarus. Kazakstan and Russia l Brief Hi&q In January 1995, Belarus, Kamkstan and Russia agreed to form a customs union in two stages. The first stage, which involved the elimination of tariffs between the three states, was completed in March 1995, and the second stage, involving agreement on a Common Extend Tariff (CET), was completed in early October 1995. l Changes in Export Duties Under Kazakstan’s previous (i.e. pre-CET) tariff schedule, there were 10 different duty rates for exports ranging from O-30 percent, with most products falling in the range of S-30 percent. With the exception of a handful of metal products, virtually all rates were expressed in ad valorem terms. Following the agreement on a CET, and the alignment of Kamkstan’s export duties with those of Russia, the number of duty rates was reduced to 6 A/ (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 percent), and the maximum rate was lowered from 30 percent to 25 percent. In addition, the number of major product groups subject to export duties was reduced from 70 to 27, including the addition of three new groups mainly related to military equipment. The new tariff structure relies to a significant extent on specific duty rates expressed in ECUs, in contrast to the previous usage of ad valorem rates. l CSanges in Import Duties The previous (i.e. pre-CET) import tariff schedule had 12 bands ranging from O-100 percent, with duties for most products falling in the range of 5-50 percent. Only a few imported items were subject to duty rates of 1 petcent (ores, coal and railroad locomotives), 2 percent (on automobile parts) and 100 percent (furniture mattresses, bed spreads etc.). Under the CET the number of import bands (including zero-rated items) remained unchanged at 12, although the previous rate of 2 percent was eliminated, and a new rate of 80 percent was introduced. 2/ With this new structure, the dispersion of rates has been narrowed as the rate of duty for most products now falls in the range of 5-30 percent; at the lower end of the schedule, the duty rate of 1 percent is applied only to cereals and to beetroots and sugar, while, at the upper end, the 50 percent rate is applied to one group of products which includes genuine or cultivated pearls, gems or precious and semi-precious stones; the maximum duty rate of 100 percent is applied only to some alcoholic drinks, and to weapons and ammunition. 11 The number is seven if an ad valorem duty of 3 percent that is applied only to “Chips or shavings from coniferous wood varieties” is included. 2/ The new rate of 80 percent is applied to playing cards and to special tables and articles for casinos.

The objective of the second stage privatization program was to complete small-scale and mass privatization by end-1995 and to intensify case-by-case privatization (see Box 2). The number of enterprises offered for sale per month was substantially increased in mid-1995 to over 700 small-scale enterprises and over 160 medium-sized enterprises during July-September. However, these offerings included a significant number of repeat offers and, in the case of mass privatization, numerous enterprises that did not qualify. u While there has always been some uncertainty as to the precise number of enterprises that need to be offered for sale, there appear to be significant shortfalls with respect to completing the mass privatization program. Under the case-by-case scheme, as of end-October, only five enterprises had been sold, partly because, for some enterprises, the approach of relying on foreign management contracts was used instead (see Box 3). In the spring of 1995, the Government introduced a new bankruptcy law, which allows for out-of-court settlement procedures to liquidate insolvent enterprises, and established two specialized agencies for industrial enterprises, namely, the Rehabilitation Bank to deal with major distressed enterprises with a heavy debt burden, and an Enterprise Restructuring Agency to handle other distressed enterprises. However, neither agency is, as yet, fully operational. By early-October 1995, only 2 of the 20 enterprises designated for takeover by the Rehabilitation Bank have had their finances effectively transferred to the Bank and were subject to a restructuring plan; also, not all of the 20 designated enterprises appear to satisfy the original selection criterion to qualify for takeover by the Bank. The activities of the Enterprise Restructuring Agency have been hampered by internal disagreements concerning the agency or Ministry to which it should be responsible. As of September 1995, the Government had approved plans for dismantling around half of qualifying state holding companies and privatizing their subsidiaries. However, progress in actually implementing these plans has been slow; there are indications that the former holding companies' subsidiaries are reorganizing in new forms of enterprise groupings. Also, there have been significant delays in dismantling the agricultural grain holding monopoly, Astyk, which has inhibited the process of aligning domestic procurement prices for grain closer to world market prices. III. Report on the Discussions The discussions focused mainly on developments under the 1995 program and the outlook for the rest of the year, as well as on the broad prospects for 1996.

The authorities indicated that they preferred to defer detailed discussions on a medium-term program that could be supported by an arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility, until early 1996. 1. Performance and short-term outlook under the 1995 program a. Macroeconomic policies The authorities expressed satisfaction with the sharp reduction in inflation since early 1995, brought about by sustained tight monetary and fiscal policies. However, they agreed with the staff that a disproportionately heavy burden had fallen on expenditure compression; the overall cash deficit of the budget had been kept much lower than planned, partly due to a build-up of arrears. Nevertheless, despite the associated pent up fiscal pressures, in the period ahead monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to aim at controlling monetary expansion; an indicative limit of 8 l/2 percent for the growth of base money has been established for the fourth quarter of 1995. Notwithstanding the lagged effect of previous monetary growth, the authorities expressed the view that the monthly inflation rate could generally remain below 2-3 percent in the months to come. The authorities viewed exchange market developments in the past several months as broadly satisfactory. Since early August 1995, monetary and exchange policy has assigned greater importance to keeping the growth of base money within predetermined limits. Foreign exchange intervention by the NBK has generally been restricted to smoothing out short-term exchange rate fluctuations and has been implemented in a manner consistent with the limits set for base money. The authorities do not envisage any change in their current approach to monetary and exchange rate policy for the time being. However, they felt that a repeat of the large-scale capital inflows experienced in mid-1995 might call for flexibility in implementing the base money targeting approach, especially if the exchange rate were to appreciate too quickly and by too much. This could cause excessive uncertainty in the foreign exchange market that would rapidly spill over into the Treasury bill and interbank credit markets and could also hurt external competitiveness. h/ They indicated that the fiscal and quasi-fiscal costs, as well as the likely effect on domestic interest rates, constrained the use of intensified sterilization operations to relieve upward pressure on the exchange rate over a sustained period. l-J In reviewing the events of mid-1995, however, they took note of the staff's observation that the rapid and sharp appreciation of the exchange rate in early August 1995 (some 10 percent within a ten day period) might have been moderated if the NBK had chosen instead to gradually stop buying foreign exchange earlier, i.e. from mid-June onwards (when the surge in capital inflows became more intense).

The first stage of this program was characterixed by spontaneous sales/takeover of enterprises by managers and workers’ collectives, with outsiders excluded. Between 1991 and early 1993, an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 enterprises were transferred to private interests in this way; however, few of the transfers were competitive and transparent, and the process lacked a strategy and clear objectives. In April 1993, a broader and more ambitious National Privatixation Program for 1993 to 1995 was adopted constituting the second stage of the privatization process. This so-called “three-tier approach” to privatization of industrial enterprises consists of small-scale privatization, a mass privatization program, and case-by-case privatization. l Record of the ‘-Tier Approach l The small scale prison pmgnm involves the sale of the assets of small enterprises (with less than 200 employees), such as shops, restaurants, and trucks. There are specific sub-programs for trucks and wholesale trade, covering the facilities of 205 warehouse enterprises. Assuming that between 18,000 to 26,000 non-agricultural objects were left for small-scale privatization by August 1993, the World Bank estimates that to date around one third to one half of these objects have been offered for sale (including repeat offers) and that up to a quarter were actually sold. 0 The mass priva&ation program covers medium to large scale enterprises (200 to 5,000 employees), which are sold through voucher auctions. Blocks of shares ranging from 51 to 90 percent of the enterprises’ capital are offered to Investment Privatixation Funds, in which citizens invest their allocated privatixation investment coupons. Workers receive 10 percent of the shares, and the remaining state share (if any) is available for cash sale. As of September 1995, 18 privatisation auctions have been conducted and a total of 1781 enterprises were offered for sale, including repeat offers. Of the 1268 enterprises offered for the first time, 756 were sold, and of the 389 enterprises offered for the second time, 312 were sold; none of the 124 enterprises which were offered for the third time were actually sold. According to World Bank estimates, some 50 to ‘70 percent of the total 1,500- 2,000 enterprises, subject to the mass privatization program, were actually sold. l The caae-byw privahatim program is for very large/strategic enterprises; 180 of such firms have been identified. So far, 5 enterprises have been sold to foreign investors, and a significant number of enterprises are now being reviewed by foreign consultant firms. Meanwhile, for a number of the large enterprises earmarked for the case-by-case privatization program, management contracts with mostly foreign companies have been concluded (see Box 3). These management contracts have effectively “by-passed” the case-by-case privatisation program.

Under these arrangements, foreign firms are given the right to manage the enterprise for a limited period of time (usually for 5 years). Almost all of the management contracts have been awarded to the management companies without competitive procedures; however, recently efforts have been made to make the bidding process more transparent. So far, 27 management contracts have heen concluded for 33 firms, mainly in the mining and metallurgy sectors. Meanwhile, 5 of the 27 contracts have been canceled. e Terms of &t&acts In exchange for bonuses and/or shams in profits and, in most cases, a priority right to purchase the majority of the firm’s shares at the end of the contract, management companies are obliged to redeem, up-front, outstanding mars of the enterprise, including to the budget. Thus, the appearance of foreign management contracts has been accompanied by large foreign exchange inflows, particularly starting in late May 1995. The authorities believe such foreign exchange inflows could eventually reach US$l-2 billion. Many contracts include additional clauses such as provisions of “soft” credits or material and equipment by the managing company, a freeze on the number of employees, or the maintenance of production volume. a Contracts aud Privatiration Almost all of the firms under management contracts would qualify for the case-by-case privatisation program; however, their privatisation appears to have been deferred until after the expiration of the contract. In an effort to find ways not to slow down the privatization of these firms, the State Property Committee recently launched a pilot project, offering small share packages of one firm under a management contract via cash and coupon auctions; a significant share was bought by the management company itself. Following this success, similar plans are now being prepared for two other firms.

In any event, if a real appreciation were to prove inevitable, it would be preferable for this to occur via low inflation and a nominal exchange rate appreciation rather than in an environment of higher inflation and a more stable nominal rate. The staff and the authorities agreed that, if unexpectedly large foreign exchange inflows were to materialize, the base money limits under the program should be made subject to review and amendment as appropriate, especially if there were indications of a corresponding rise in the demand for real balances. The relatively successful conduct of monetary policy in recent periods owes much to the impressive progress of the NBK in liquidity management, which is now conducted within a formalized institutional framework employing an increased array of indirect monetary policy instruments. u While the banking system remains fragile, recent mergers and liquidation of some smaller banks and improved bank supervision (See Section 111.2) have helped create a core of larger banks with whom the NBK can interact effectively. Sterilization operations using short-term NBK notes have come to play an important role since mid-1995, and a Lombard Facility has been in place since September 1995. For the time being, credit auctions are expected to continue to be a significant monetary policy tool; the authorities intend to improve the functioning of the auctions by increasing their frequency, reducing the average maturity of auctioned credit, and eliminating regional auctions. During 1996, the NBK plans to develop further the interbank market as well as NBK T-bill operations in the secondary market, and to introduce repos and reverse repos. In view of their harmful effect on the conduct of monetary policy, the staff welcomed the decision not to issue any further KOs. The authorities are considering lowering the relatively high reserve requirement (at present 20 percent of deposits in both domestic and foreign currency), and reducing the implicit tax on banks by raising the interest rate paid on required reserves (currently 25 percent of the refinance rate). The staff agreed that moves in these directions are warranted, while noting that the appropriate magnitude and timing of changes should be considered in light of the potential budgetary impact (via lower NBK profits) and the likely effect on the money multiplier. Fiscal nolicv has been extremely tight thus far in 1995. However, the markedly lower-than-programmed deficit (on a cash basis) during the first nine months of the year was brought about in part by the accumulation of lJ As of September 1995, average wages in Russia, expressed in U.S. dollars, were about 25 percent higher than in Kazakstan (Chart 5, lower panel). 2J Extensive technical assistance has been provided by MAE in this area.

In this context, the staff observed that a very sizable margin with respect to the program's ceiling on net credit to the budget had arisen largely due to a major, unplanned- -and to a considerable extent unmonitored--build-up of Government deposits with the banking system. This pointed to the need for improved cash management and coordination between the NBK and the Ministry of Finance. The authorities indicated that full implementation in 1996 of the new Treasury system (with FAD technical assistance) should help solve this problem. The authorities expect the overall budget deficit for 1995 as a whole to reach 2.7 percent of GDP, compared to the program limit of 3.5 percent of GDP. The sharp rise in the deficit in the fourth quarter (to 8.6 percent of quarterly GDP) compared to the first nine months of the year is mainly due to the planned settlement of all arrears on wages and external debt (see below) and a large part of other outstanding budgetary obligations. lJ Net foreign financing in 1995 is now expected to be lower than programmed (by 1.2 percent of GDP) due both to delays in some official disbursements and a stronger than expected exchange rate for the Tenge. Domestic bank financing of the deficit should be the same as originally envisaged, while net nonbank financing should be larger than programmed due to the less-than- complete redemption of U.S. dollar-indexed bonds. As noted earlier, the authorities intend to settle all outstanding KOs by end-1995 (this is a structural benchmark under the program). The fiscal and monetary program assumes that the second tranche of the World Bank SAL (US$90 million) will be disbursed before end-1995. However, given the substantial uncertainties involved, in the event of shortfalls/excesses in actual foreign financing relative to the programmed amounts, the program provides for an automatic corresponding upward/downward adjustment (up to US$90 million) of the ceilings relating to the increase in net domestic credit to the Government during the fourth quarter. 2J The current account of the balance of payments in 1995 is now envisaged to register a deficit of about US$600 million (3.4 percent of GDP) compared to the programmed deficit of US$1,167 million (7.2 percent of GDP). Thus, despite the fact that official capital inflows will be below the programmed level, an overall balance of payments surplus of about US$330 million is now projected. Net international reserves of the NBK are expected to increase by around US$330 million for the year as a whole (compared to a program lJ The accumulated arrears (about T 20 billion) correspond to around 7 percent of fourth quarter GDP. 2J The same adjustment applies to both NDA and NIR of the NBK (in the case of NIR, the adjustment is in the opposite direction). The adjustment is larger than in the originally approved program (US$75 million). However, the total shortfall in net foreign financing to the budget is now estimated at between US$130 and US$220 million.

Considerable difficulties continue to be experienced with respect to the timely servicing of Kazakstan's external debt service obligations associated with borrowing by enterprises which received government guarantees, particularly in the early period after independence. In the July discussions with the staff, an amount of US$12 million had been identified as being in arrears on government-guaranteed loans as of July 31, 1995; these arrears were cleared on August 9, 1995. In the Board paper supporting the authorities' request for a waiver of the performance criterion relating to the non-accumulation of official external debt service arrears (EBS/95/147), the staff indicated that there were other arrears totalling US$48 million-- apart from the US$12 million--in respect of government-guaranteed debt, which the authorities considered to be in dispute and which were the subject of ongoing administrative and legal investigations. During the recent discussions, the authorities explained that, as a result of their investigations and following major improvements in data collection and monitoring of past external borrowing by enterprises, the total amount of arrears on all debt--disputed and non-disputed--as of November 1, 1995, had been calculated at US$96 million. u However, they had concluded that so far as relations with official creditors were concerned, the distinction between internally disputed and non-disputed debt was not generally relevant or useful. On November 14, 1995, arrears of US$90 million were settled, leaving an amount of US$6 million owed to one creditor. 2/ The authorities are engaged in discussions with the creditor concerned (U.S. Eximbank) concerning the legality of the government guarantee that may be involved and expect the matter to be resolved shortly. The staff will report to the Executive Board on the outcome of these discussions prior to the Board meeting. The authorities have drawn up and provided the staff with a monthly series of forthcoming debt service obligations on all government and government-guaranteed external debt. They intend to confirm to Fund Management, prior to Executive Board consideration of the review under the u They also indicated that the total amount in arrears as of end-July 1995 had been re-estimated at US$90 million, compared to the authorities' original estimate of US$60 million referred to by the staff in EBS/95/147, page 2. The staff understands that the difference between these two figures relates to additional debt that the authorities considered to be under dispute at that time. Until August 1995, the Ministry of Finance did not possess comprehensive records on government guaranteed debt which had been maintained, first with Alembank, and, from late 1994, with Eximbank. The changes in the estimates of arrears that have occurred in recent months reflect further processing and verification of loan records. a The difference between this figure of US$96 million and the US$86 million referred to in the authorities' Letter of Intent reflects the final calculation of the amounts actually paid.

To help implement a prudent external debt management policy, ceilings for the remainder of the program period relating to short- and medium-to-long-term debt have been established; other institutional steps to strengthen debt management policies (including provision of data to the World Bank's Debt Reporting System by December 31, 1995, which is a structural benchmark under the program) are described in paragraph 13 of the authorities' Letter of Intent. The authorities have requested a waiver for the non-observance of the performance criterion under the stand-by arrangement with respect to the non-accumulation of external arrears on offic.ial debt service. On the basis of the authorities' actions to date, including settlement of all arrears except for an amount of US$6 million, and the taking of specific measures to1 prevent a recurrence of the problem, the staff recommends granting of the waiver. Regarding claims vis-8-vis Russia, the authorities stated that the Protocol signed in January 1995 by the Prime Ministers of Kazakstan and Russia called for a mutual cancellation of claims, which would involve Russia canceling the stock of debt accumulated during 1991-94 owed by Kazakstan, and Kazakstan renouncing its claims on Russia for ecological damage associated with the operation of the Baikonour space complex in 1991-93. Accordingly, they stated that the separate agreement on the annual rental payment by Russia of US$115 million for 20 years for use of the Baikonour space center should imply a net payment to Kazakstan. The authorities informed the staff, however, that the current position of the Russian authorities appears to be different from that of the Protocol. The Russian authorities have indicated to the Kazak authorities that only the interest on the stock of debt should be offset against the claims by Kazakstan for damage and that future rental payments by Russia for the Baikonour space center should be used to amortize the debt owed to Russia (estimated at USS1.4 billion). Under such a scheme, no net payment would be made by Russia to Kazakstan in respect of rental payments for Baikonour until the debt owed to Russia was fully amortized. The Kazak authorities informed the staff that the positions of the two parties had not been reconciled but that negotiations were continuing. u Kazakstan continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangement under Article XIV but no longer maintains exchange restrictions under the transitional arrangement. Proceeds of current international transactions deposited in certain non-resident T-type Tenge accounts cannot be freely converted and transferred abroad and there are limitations on the making of 1/ In the meantime, the Russian authorities continue to adhere to their agreement, conveyed at the Consultative Group meeting on Kazakstan in 1995, to defer all payments due on Kazak debt to Russia through June 1996.

JJ As such, these accounts and the import payment limitations give rise to exchange restrictions which are subject to approval under Article VIII, section 2(a). However, the authorities intend to eliminate these restrictions in early 1996, and to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF's Articles of Agreement in the first half of 1996. No new exchange restrictions, which would be subject to approval under Article VIII, were imposed by the Kazak authorities since the last Article IV consultation. b. Structural policies The authorities noted that during 1995 important progress had continued in the structural transformation of Kazakstan's economy. Small-scale privatization had proceeded steadily, several major holding companies had been broken up, a significant reform of unemployment benefits had been implemented, 2J and the divestiture of the social assets of enterprises to local governments had commenced. However, as noted in Section II, progress lagged somewhat behind schedule in some key areas. As a result, as described in paragraph 16 of their letter, the authorities indicated their intention, by December 1, 1995, to accelerate actions relating to mass privatization, dismantlement of the agricultural grain monopoly, Astyk, establishment of the Rehabilitation Bank, and the preparation of land reform legislation (these measures are structural benchmarks under the program). The staff observed that this deadline was very ambitious, especially given the technical complexities involved. Progress on these areas was to be discussed with a World Bank SAL supervision mission in early-December. 2/ IJ The T-type Tenge accounts refer to local currency balances held in the banking system by non-residents which may be credited with proceeds from current payments made by residents. 2J The basic unemployment benefit (received by most workers) was raised to three times the minimum wage (equivalent to 16 percent of the average wage) and the duration of benefits was set at six months (which may be extended). Workers laid off from enterprises undergoing restructuring would receive from 2 to 3 times the basic rate. 3J Preliminary information suggests that there have been some slippages with respect to the deadline. Specifically, as of December 1, 1995, (i) approximately 500 medium- and large-scale enterprises remain to be privatized (compared to the target of around 900 enterprises to be privatized during May-December 1995); (ii) while the agricultural grain monopoly, Astyk, has been restructured, most of its former subsidiaries have not been privatized so far; (iii) there have been delays in the transfer of the finances of 20 large distressed enterprises to the Rehabilitation Bank; and (iv) while proposed land reform legislation has been discussed with the World Bank, it is still under review within the Cabinet. Prior to the Board meeting the staff will provide a more detailed report to the Executive Board on the status of these measures as well as the outcome of the discussions with the World Bank staff, including the next steps planned by the authorities.

The outlook for 1996 At the time of the discussions, the authorities were in the process of preparing the 1996 budget and the associated macroeconomic framework; they were hoping to finalize the budget by early December. Financial policies are expected to remain tight, with the aim of reducing average monthly inflation further to about 2 percent during 1996. Real GDP is likely to stabilize at around this year's level. While the external current account deficit is expected to widen somewhat mainly owing to a pickup in import demand, the prospective capital account balance (assuming sizable official disbursements from existing commitments as well as some new commitments) should permit the overall balance of payments to remain in significant surplus. The staff, while in broad agreement with this macroeconomic framework, suggested that a somewhat more ambitious inflation objective, perhaps of the order of 1 l/2 percent per month, would be preferable, especially since the process of relative price adjustment had already proceeded quite far in Kazakstan, and the economy was not subject to extensive inflation indexation. The authorities responded that significant relative price adjustments for utilities and communal services were envisaged for 1996 and that the experience of other transition economies underscored the considerable difficulties encountered in quickly reducing monthly inflation much below the 2 percent range. lJ In any event, the authorities' monetary program for the first quarter of 1996 aims at limiting base money growth to 6 percent which, in the staff's view, would be consistent with limiting cumulative inflation to about 5 l/2 percent. It was agreed that the question of the appropriate inflation objective for all of 1996 and the associated monetary program would be revisited with the staff in early 1996. The authorities indicated that they were contemplating a budpet deficit for 1996 of the order of 3 - 3 l/2 percent of GDP, compared to the staff suggestion of a maximum deficit of around 2 l/2 percent of GDP. The difference between these alternative limits for the deficit reflects the staff's assumption of somewhat lower net credit to the budget from the banking system (reflecting, in turn, a more ambitious inflation target) and the authorities' expectation that more net foreign financing could become available than has been identified to date. For the first quarter of 1996 (traditionally a seasonally favorable period for the budget), the program limits the increase in net credit to the budget from the banking system to about 0.6 percent of GDP; given available indications regarding likely foreign financing, this would be consistent with an overall budget deficit lJ However, at the time of the discussions, the precise time path for these increases in administered prices was still being worked out.

On present policies, after taking into account the full impact in 1996 of the extensive changes in the Tax Code approved in mid-1995, u revenue is expected to amount to 15.5 percent of GDP, or roughly the same level as in 1995. In view of Kazakstan's relatively low revenue/GDP ratio and the need to mobilize resources to finance additional expenditures relating to ongoing restructuring, the staff urged the authorities to embark upon a major revenue enhancing effort. This could cover: (i) a fundamental overhaul of the taxation of natural resources (particularly petroleum and gold) on the basis of a revised section of the Tax Code on income taxes and a supplement on petroleum taxation; (ii) a reform of the personal income tax in order to increase its presently low yield and to enhance equity; (iii) a removal of exemptions on some direct taxes; (iv) changes in the VAT (for instance, the universal use of the invoice method, and a switch to an accrual basis); and (v) measures to increase revenues from land and property taxation. At the same time, in the context of the customs union with Belarus and the Russian Federation, consideration should be given to lowering the average duty rate and reducing the dispersion of rates, accompanied by the elimination of export duties on a phased basis. The authorities, while agreeing that these proposals deserved careful consideration, observed that following the extensive changes embodied in the new Tax Code, it was desirable to avoid excessive tinkering with the tax system. Also, the possibility of major changes in petroleum sector taxation might be circumscribed, at least in the short-run, by existing tax agreements with individual foreign companies. They also indicated that the implementation of the delayed project to improve tax administration should boost revenues in 1996. J/ At the time of the discussions, expenditure plans for 1996 were still being developed with individual ministries. The authorities had in mind a significant increase in social expenditures (including a further take-over of social assets of enterprises, such as health and primary education facilities), probably accompanied by some rationalization of services and lJ For the first quarter of 1996, the program also provides for an automatic adjustor (up to US$90 million) to net credit from the banking system to the government and to the budget, NDA, and NIR of the NBK to accommodate divergences between actual and projected flows of net foreign financing to the budget. 2J See the accompanying report on Recent Economic Developments for details. 3J As a pilot project, the authorities intend to introduce computerized systems and procedures for VAT administration in the Almaty region.

Investment (mainly on infrastructure) was envisaged to increase somewhat. The authorities also plan, if possible by early 1996, to increase sharply average remuneration of government employees, financed by a major retrenchment of personnel (averaging 20 to 40 percent, depending on the ministry or agency). The staff cautioned that any salary increase should only follow full implementation of the personnel reductions when the savings associated with the latter (net of costs such as severance payments) had been achieved. Otherwise, an increased wage bill would conflict with the authorities' other worthwhile expenditure priorities. The authorities agreed that these considerations might call for some delay in the planned salary adjustment, perhaps beyond the first quarter of 1996. The staff also observed that the authorities' budgetary plans did not at this stage incorporate likely additional net expenditures associated with the restructuring of enterprises, the strengthening of the Employment Fund, and reform of the financial sector (see below). This would increase the potential budgetary "gap" for 1996 beyond the l/2 to 1 percentage point of GDP accounted for by the difference between the authorities' current plans, and the scenario suggested by the staff. The authorities indicated that their thinking on these issues had not yet fully evolved, but said that, in the event that a major additional fiscal burden were to emerge, the need for further revenue measures would be looked at carefully so as to maintain the deficit within acceptable limits. lJ As noted above, regarding the enterprise sector, the authorities plan to take steps by end-1995 to accelerate mass privatization, enterprise restructuring, and the dismantling of the government grain holding monopoly. In tandem, they intend to develop detailed plans for 1996 relating to these and related areas. Several issues need to be addressed urgently, in consultation with the World Bank: (i) the scope and modalities of the third stage privatization program covering 1996 and beyond, which is expected to involve sale of leftover state shares in already privatized firms, enterprises that were not included in the small-scale or mass privatization tiers of the second stage, major firms targeted for the case-by-case approach, and public utilities; (ii) measures to improve governance of financially healthy enterprises (e.g. the removal of barriers to effective assumption of governance by investment privatization funds and large private investors, the facilitating of secondary ownership transfers, and further dismantling of state holding companies); (iii) clarification of the roles, responsibilities and work plans of the three state-supported agencies--the Rehabilitation Bank, the Agricultural Support Fund and the Enterprise Restructuring Agency--that are, in principle, charged with dealing with financially distressed enterprises in industry and agriculture. In particular, if the Rehabilitation Bank is to play a key role in restructuring, delineation of the amount, duration, and purpose of resources IJ The authorities have announced their intention to move the capital from Almaty to Akmola within the next 2-3 years, a step which is likely to involve significant budgetary expenditures.

Clearly, resolution of some of these issues may have significant budgetary implications. The authorities also agreed with the staff that reform of the financial sector should be assigned a high priority. Due to earlier government intervention in commercial bank lending operations, a pervasive climate of non-payment by enterprises, and past lax bank supervision, several of Kazakstan's banks from the Soviet era, representing over half of the total assets of the banking system, are thought to be close to a situation of negative net worth if proper loan provisioning were to be made; also, several smaller banks that received licenses shortly after independence are in a fragile financial situation. The staff suggested that a reform strategy--to be worked out jointly by the NBK and the Government--should involve several elements: (i) improvements in bank supervision involving, inter alia, implementation of new capital requirements that were introduced in October 1995, enhanced offsite and onsite examination, and increased staff resources and training: (ii) privatization, to the extent possible, of viable components of most state banks; (iii) limitation of the size and activity of those banks remaining in state ownership, accompanied by a restructuring of bank management; (iv) provision of reasonable fiscal incentives, for example, by permitting the deductibility, for tax purpose, of loan loss provisions; (v) reducing reserve requirements and/or increasing the level of their remuneration; and (vi) merger or closure of those banks-- state-owned or private- -that cannot survive after taking into account possible fiscal incentives, accompanied by increased compensation of required reserves. The staff also expressed the view that the option of major capital injections, either from the budget or from external sources, should be viewed with caution, both because of potential moral hazard problems and the high fiscal cost. The authorities agreed with the broad thrust of this approach, which is already starting to be implemented. In particular, the state had divested itself of most of the shares in all but two banks, and the NBK had pursued a very aggressive policy in closing or merging many small banks. L/ They indicated that further analysis is underway to assess the precise magnitude of the problem-- under different assumptions about the prospective recovery of loans from enterprises --and the fiscal and quasi fiscal costs of alternative solutions. The staff said that the Fund's MAE Department--in coordination with the World Bank--stands ready to provide technical assistance to help formulate an appropriate strategy. Structural reforms are proceeding in several other areas: (i) an inventory of social assets held by enterprises has been completed and a I/ The number of banks has been reduced from about 190 in early 1995 to about 140 by mid-October 1995.

Finally, sector specific measures in the transport, agricultural, petroleum and health and education sector are being examined, with the aim of increasing competition and efficiency. 3. Technical assistance Substantial technical assistance and training has been provided by the Fund to Kazakstan in recent years (see Appendix II). In addition to stationing a resident representative in Almaty since August 1992, several resident Fund advisors have been assigned to directly assist the National Bank, the State Committee for Statistics (Goskomstat), and the Ministry of Finance, and to coordinate the advice provided by other national and international agencies. Technical assistance has also been provided by the World Bank focussing mainly on structural issues, and by others, including EU TACIS, USAID, OECD, and the EBRD. Considerable further assistance will be needed, inter alia, in certain areas of statistics, tax administration, social expenditure issues, and reform of the banking system. The authorities have in general been very receptive to recommendations of Fund technical assistance; however, their implementation of recommendations has in some cases been slow. While this in part was due to a lack of skilled staff, coordination of technical assistance among international agencies needs to be strengthened in some areas. .l/ IV. The Medium-Term Outlook and Capacity to Repay the Fund 1. Overview The staff held preliminary discussions on the broad elements of a draft economic program covering 1996-98, which the authorities are in the process of preparing. The goal of their medium-term plan is to create an environment capable of achieving significant positive real GDP growth. To achieve this, their strategy envisages: first, a consolidation and strengthening of the process of reducing inflation and achieving external I/ For example, during July-August 1995, three different groups of experts (in addition to the Fund resident advisor on statistics) provided advice--which varied to some extent-- to Goskomstat in national accounts compilation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - balance of payments viability; and second, an acceleration of the structural transformation of the economy. The staff supported this approach and suggested that key elements of the program should involve, in addition to continued tight financial policies, wide-ranging structural measures concerning: the development of additional monetary and fiscal instruments (including tax policy, tax administration and expenditure management); reorientation of government expenditures to create room for increases in outlays other than on wages and transfers, including for capital rehabilitation and investment; pension reform; the acceleration of enterprise privatization/restructuring; reform of the financial sector; adjustments in certain administered prices (particularly of energy) so as to bring Kazakstan's relative prices more into line with world relative prices and to achieve cost recovery; improvement of competition on domestic markets; the further integration of Kazakstan into the world economy, including the establishment of conditions favorable for the attraction of foreign direct investment; an overhaul of social expenditure policies so as to improve efficiency and achieve better targeting of particularly vulnerable groups (e.g., pensioners and children of large families); removal of specific structural impediments in key sectors such as agriculture, energy, and transport; and legal reform to help strengthen the formal and institutional framework for a market economy. The authorities agreed with this policy agenda and stated that work would be intensified in the period ahead, in consultation with the Fund and Bank staffs, to develop a comprehensive and detailed set of measures, together with a timetable for implementation. It was expected that the Bank staff would take the lead in the discussions with the authorities on some of these issues. Assuming a comprehensive program along the above lines is put in place quickly, a tentative quantitative medium-term scenario prepared by the staff suggests that the investment/GDP ratio could increase by about 4 percentage points during 1996-98 (Table 6). Assuming a continued decline in employment due to emigration, as well as some increase in total factor productivity, real GDP might increase by about 1 l/2 percent per annum on average; per capita GDP would increase by more. The main engine for growth is likely to be the extraction and primary processing of energy and mineral resources and, to a lesser extent, development of associated downstream industrial activities with high value added. The increased investment effort would be financed by higher domestic savings from both the non-government and government sectors, in the order of 3 and 1 percentage points of GDP, respectively. Foreign savings would also increase by about 1 percentage point of GDP in 1996-97 before declining in 1998. Non-government savings should be boosted by continued positive real interest rates, increased choice of savings instruments and improvements in financial intermediation.

The balance of pavments outlook lJ Under a conservative baseline scenario regarding access to Russian pipelines and moderate increases in inflows of foreign direct investments, Kazakstan's external current account deficit (including transfers) is projected to widen from 3 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995 to 4 percent of GDP in 1996 and to 4 l/2 percent of GDP in 1997, before narrowing gradually to about 2 3/4 percent by 2002 (Table 7). The initial deterioration of the deficit would reflect a sharp increase in imports from their current low levels due to a recovery in economic activity and incomes and increased capital goods imports associated with foreign direct investments--imports are projected to increase by an average of about 8.8 percent per year in 1996-2002. Exports are projected to increase at an average annual rate of about 9 percent in 1996-2002, as ongoing investments in the oil and gas sectors start to payoff, particularly after 1998, u and non-energy exports pickup, due to improvements in enterprise efficiency and the assumed maintenance of external competitiveness; in real terms, non-energy exports would increase by roughly 6-7 percent a year. 3J The capital account surplus is projected to decline gradually from about 4.:7 percent of GDP in 1996 to about 3.4 percent of GDP by 2002; the composition of capital inflows would shift away from official financing in favor of foreign direct investment and private capital. Net capital inflows would be expected to more than cover the prospective current account deficits, and this should permit the NIR of the NBK to remain at a level equivalent to about 3 l/2 months of imports during 1996-2002. With the envisaged decline in the external current account deficit and improved access to private inflows, Kazakstan's need for exceptional financing could be eliminated in 1998. However, during 1997, it is estimated that Kazakstan would require exceptional financing on the order of US$200 million, which could be provided by multilateral and bilateral sources. I-J Pending final agreement between Kazakstan and Russia on the mutual settlement of claims, the projections have excluded both scheduled debt service payments by Kazakstan to Russia and Russia's rental payments to Kazakstan for use of the Baikonour space center. 2J Specifically, oil exports are projected to increase from 11 l/2 million tons in 1996, to about 20 million tons by the year 2002. This scenario assumes that pipelines connecting the Tengiz oil field to Novorossisk will be operational by 1998; however, there is considerable uncertainty as regards the financing of this project. 3J The projections for oil export prices and for import prices are based on price projections prepared as part of the World Economic Outlook. Specifically, it is assumed that both export and import prices would increase by an average of 1 l/2 percent a year in 1996-2000; oil export prices would decline by 4.4 percent in 1996, and increase by an average of about 1 l/2 percent a year in 1997-2000. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - Kazakstan's external debt outstanding (including Fund credit and debt owed to Russia) is projected to rise from USS4.2 billion at end-1996 to about USS6.2 billion by 2002 (22 percent of GDP.) The debt service ratio is projected to increase from 10.6 percent in 1995 to a peak of 13 percent in 1999, and to decline gradually thereafter to a sustainable level of about 10 percent by 2002. For illustrative purposes, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken by assuming that the external current account deficit is persistently higher by 1 percentage point of GDP during 1997-2002. Specifically, the value of exports was assumed to increase by an average of 7 3/4 percent per year as against the 8 l/2 percent assumed under the baseline scenario. Under these assumptions, Kazakstan's stock of debt would rise to USS7.8 billion (about 28 percent of GDP) by 2002, reflecting the need for additional financing requirements estimated at about USS1.6 billion. The debt service ratio (including the Fund), would peak at about 14 percent in 1999, and then decline to 11 l/2 percent by 2002. Assuming that all purchases under the present stand-by arrangement are made, Kazakstan's outstanding obligations to the Fund would increase to 154.5 percent of quota (SDR 382.4 million) by end-1996 (Table 8). On this basis, annual payments for charges and repurchases to the Fund would rise from 1.5 percent of gross international reserves in 1996 to a peak of 11.4 percent in 1999, and then decline to 1.5 percent by 2002; payments to the Fund would remain modest relative to exports (peaking at 4 percent in 1999) throughout the projection period. Kazakstan has effected all payments to the Fund on the due dates, and the authorities continue to place the highest priority on making payments to the Fund. Moreover, given Kazakstan's strong reserve position throughout the projection period and the cautious assumptions underlying the balance of payments, particularly in respect of foreign direct investment, Kazakstan should be able to meet its financial obligations to the Fund on a timely basis. V. Staff Appraisal Since 1993 significant, albeit at times uneven, progress has been made toward achieving financial stabilization and the structural transformation of the Kazak economy. During 1994, inflation was reduced markedly and the balance of payments began to strengthen. However, financial policies in 1994 were of a stop-and-go nature, largely as a result of continuing pressures emanating from the enterprise sector, where progress in restructuring lagged significantly. The 1995 program, therefore, called for a sharp tightening of fiscal and monetary policies, accompanied by a major push on enterprise restructuring, via accelerated privatization and new institutional arrangements to tackle large, financially distressed enterprises. Progress thus far in 1995 in adhering to stricter financial policies has been commendable, with all performance criteria (except for that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - relating to external arrears) having been met for end-June and end-September by comfortable margins. The fall in inflation has helped rebuild financial confidence, as reflected in a noticeable increase in the demand for money. The balance of payments has also performed much better than expected despite shortfalls in official foreign financing inflows. The pickup in inflation in recent months, partly due to administered price increases, is nevertheless worrisome and points to the need for continued determination to ensure that the monetary and credit targets for the fourth quarter of 1995 and the first quarter of 1996 are adhered to. The sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit to well below program limits was achieved largely via an unsustainable build-up of budgetary arrears, the settlement of which will inevitably cause the deficit to increase very sharply in the last quarter of 1995. A more even distribution of cash expenditures throughout the year would have been preferable. Also, an unplanned-- and to a large extent unmonitored--build-up of government deposits during the course of the year underscores the need for improved budgetary cash management. In view of their harmful effects on the conduct of monetary policy and on developing markets for regular government securities, the staff welcomes the decision to eliminate the stock of special treasury obligations (KOs) by end-1995 and to refrain from issuing such government obligations on non-market terms in the future. The NBK has shown flexibility and resourcefulness in conducting monetary and exchange rate policy throughout 1995. The staff supports the authorities' approach since mid-1995 of permitting greater exchange rate flexibility and placing greater emphasis on base money targeting. Their readiness to review the implementation of this approach with the staff, in the event that an unexpectedly sharp recurrence of large-scale capital inflows were to lead to too rapid or sharp fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate, and taking into account possible increases in the demand for real balances, is appropriate. Irrespective of the approach taken to monetary policy, however, a fundamental improvement in the balance of payments may inevitably be reflected in some real appreciation of the Tenge. It would be preferable for this to occur in an environment of low inflation and some nominal appreciation of the exchange rate. The NBK is to be congratulated for developing rapidly its liquidity management techniques by employing a growing array of indirect monetary policy instruments. The authorities are encouraged to build upon this progress by improving further the functioning of credit auctions and by developing the secondary market for Treasury bills and instituting repos and reverse repos during 1996. Their continued commitment to adjust the refinance rate so as to achieve positive real interest rates is crucial. The authorities' preliminary macroeconomic framework for 1996 is broadly appropriate. Nevertheless, the staff would urge the adoption of a somewhat more ambitious inflation target to lessen the risk that current rates of inflation would become too firmly entrenched. Such a policy may call for a tighter fiscal and monetary stance than the authorities are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - currently contemplating for the year as a whole. However, the program's fiscal and monetary targets for the first quarter of 1996 are compatible with such a stance. The authorities' budgetary revenue plans for 1996 at this stage appear insufficiently ambitious. Given Kazakstan's relatively low ratio of revenue to GDP and the likelihood of significant additional expenditures relating to restructuring, a major revenue enhancing strategy is called for. This should encompass increased revenues from natural resources, a reform of the personal income tax, and measures to increase revenues from VAT. At the same time, in agreement with the other members of the customs union with Russia and Belarus, consideration should be given to lowering average import duties and reducing the dispersion of rates, accompanied by a phased elimination of export duties. The staff endorses the broad thrust of the authorities' thinking on expenditure priorities for 1996, in particular, the planned increases in investment and social expenditures (such as a takeover of the social assets of enterprises), accompanied by some rationalization of benefits and improved targeting. While the plans to implement a major personnel retrenchment and simultaneously raise salaries significantly are appropriate, great care is needed to be taken to ensure that this does not lead to unexpected increases in the relative share of the wage bill, which would conflict with other expenditure priorities. While progress on fiscal and monetary policies has been broadly sustained throughout 1995, the pace of enterprise reform has, regrettably, lagged. The staff welcomes the decision to accelerate progress in privatization, restructuring of distressed enterprises, the dismantling of the grain holding monopoly, and land reform. However, there is a pressing need to delineate more clearly, in consultation with the World Bank, the authorities' strategy for continuing restructuring in 1996 and beyond. Clarification of the roles and responsibilities of the different agencies involved (particularly the Rehabilitation Bank), the size, duration and purpose of financial resources to be provided to ailing enterprises, and the scope and modalities of the next privatization program, is urgently required. In this context, resources to be devoted to ailing enterprises should be strictly targeted to achieving restructuring or liquidation rather than to supporting unsustainable activities. Given the fragile financial situation of many banks, the reform of the financial sector should also be assigned a high priority. The authorities' aggressive moves to close or merge small financially nonviable banks are appropriate, and a comprehensive strategy for dealing with large "problem banks" --which may well involve fiscal or quasi-fiscal costs--is now called for. To reduce moral hazard problems, the right strategy should seek to avoid rewarding institutions responsible for past lending mistakes. The reemergence of external debt arrears, which is damaging Kazakstan's international credit-worthiness, is regrettable. The staff welcomes the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - authorities' recent settlement of these arrears and the firm assurances that specific steps have been taken to prevent recurrence of the problem. It is essential that specific institutional arrangements be set up to ensure close monitoring of actual debt service payments in relation to the monthly schedule of forthcoming obligations. The staff urges the authorities to try to finalize the mutual settlement of claims vis-a-vis the Russian Federation as quickly as possible. The authorities are to be commended for maintaining a liberal trade and exchange system. Their intention to eliminate the remaining exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII and to accept the obligations of Article VIII in the near future is also to be welcomed. In view of the nondiscriminatory nature of these remaining exchange restrictions and the authorities' timetable for their elimination, the staff recommends that the Fund approve their retention until June 30, 1996. While the authorities have made a good start in delineating their medium-term program, development of a comprehensive package of specific measures, encompassing the policy agenda discussed with the staff, should be accelerated. The staff hopes that the authorities will be in a position to undertake detailed discussions on a medium-term program which could be supported by an arrangement under the EFF in early 1996. Kazakstan possesses immense natural resources and the capacity to achieve sustained high growth rates and a strong balance of payments in the right policy environment. Continued tight financial policies and a major intensification of structural reforms are the key to unleashing the economy's productive potential. Given the progress achieved thus far, a strong medium-term program along such lines deserves the support of the international community. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Kazakstan take place on the standard 12"month consultation cycle.

Proposed Decisions The following draft decisions are proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: A. 1995 Consultation 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Kazakstan's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Section 2(a), in the light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Kazakstan, conducted under Decision No. 5392" (77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Kazakstan maintains exchange restrictions in the form of limitations on the transferability of current balances held in non-resident “T" Tenge accounts and on the making of pre- and post-delivery import payments. In light of the authorities' intention to eliminate these remaining exchange restrictions in early 1996, the Fund approves their retention until June 30, 1996. B. Review Under Stand-By Arrangement 1. The Republic of Kazakstan has consulted with the Fund in accordance with paragraph 3 (c) of the stand-by arrangement for the Republic of Kazakstan (EBS/95/78, Supplement 3, 6/7/95) and paragraph 25 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies During 1995 (“Memorandum"), Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - attached to the letter of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakstan, dated May 12, 1995. 2. The letter of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the Chairman of the National Bank of Kazakstan, dated November 24, 1995, shall be attached to the stand-by arrangement and the letter dated May 12, 1995, with annexed Memorandum, shall be read as supplemented and modified by the letter dated November 24, 1995. 3. Accordingly, the performance criteria, set out in paragraphs 3 (a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of the stand-by arrangement, for December 31, 1995 and March 31, 1996, shall be as specified in Table 1 attached to the letter dated November 24, 1995. 4. The Fund decides that the first review contemplated in paragraph 3 (c) of the stand-by arrangement for Kazakstan is completed and that (a) the Republic of Kazakstan may proceed to make purchases in accordance with the provisions of the stand-by arrangement, notwithstanding the non-observance of the performance criterion specified in paragraph 3 (b) of the stand-by arrangement; and (b) the Republic of Kazakstan may make purchases under the stand-by arrangement through January 19, 1996, notwithstanding that the end-December 1995 data for the performance criteria specified in paragraphs 3 (a)(i) through (vii) of the stand-by arrangement, as amended, are not available.

VIII. IX. X. Exchange rate arrangements: The currency of Kazakstan is the Tenge, which was introduced in November 1993. The official exchange rate is determined on the basis of interbank foreign exchange auctions that are now held three times each week. Auctions are held for U.S. dollars, deutsche marks and Russian rubles, and official rates are quoted for over thirty other currencies on the basis of cross-rates. The foreign exchange rate moved from T 4.68 per U.S. dollar in late- November 1993 to T 64.05 per U.S. dollar at November 30, 1995. Nearly 2,000 exchange bureaus have been established throughout Kazakstan; the rates at these bureaus is very close to the auction rate, and the spread between buying and selling rates is very small. Resident renresentative The Fund's first Resident Representative, Mr. Jorge Sol-Perez, was in Almaty from August 1992 until May 1994.

Through early October 1995, the Bank has approved the following seven operations, with a total loan amount of US$557 million: (i) a Technical Assistance loan of US$38 million; (ii) a Rehabilitation Loan of US$180 million; (iii) an Urban Transport Loan of US$40 million; and (iv) a Petroleum Technical Assistance Loan of USS15.7 million; (v) a Finance and Enterprise Development loan of US$62 million; (vi) a Social Protection Loan of US$41 million; and (vii) a Structural Adjustment Loan of US$180 million; nearly US$283 million have been disbursed under Bank loans. The Bank's proposed lending program planned for 1996-99, with indicative lending of US$300 million per annum, includes a series of adjustment operations, including a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FY96). In addition, proposed investment projects include among others: Treasury Modernization; Uzen Oilfield Rehabilitation; Post-Privatization Restructuring; Land and Real Estate Registration, and Irrigation Projects. A regional operation (North Aral Sea Project) would help to arrest environmental degradation in the Aral Sea region. Further economic and sector work is planned, including a poverty assessment and analysis of the financial demands of transition, and a review of fiscal management and reform options. The IFC, at mid-1995, had four investments in the banking and oil sectors, amounting to more than US$lOO million; a proposal to participate in privately owned and financed power generation facilities is currently under review.

National accounts. nrice indices. wages. and employment In recent years, Kazakstan has received considerable technical assistance and training from the IMF, EUKOSTAT, the OECD, the World Bank as well as from Germany, Turkey, and the U.S. in the area of national accounts. The authorities approved a reorganization of the State Statistics Committee (Goskomstat) in February 1995. From 1995 onwards, Goskomstat has discontinued calculating net material product and has begun computation of a real GDP index. These data now include estimates for the value added of ownership of dwellings. However, the expenditure side data and estimates using the income approach are of poor quality. Specific problems include: incomplete coverage of enterprises, especially in the emerging private sector; inaccurate reporting of expenditures, particularly by the agricultural sector and trade sectors; problems of valuation (especially of stocks); and the use of a global estimation method in certain instances. The consumer price index which measures inflation in urban areas, is now calculated according to international standards. The basket comprises 275 goods, and the weighing system has been revised recently using the 1994 Household Budget Survey, with an improvement in coverage. The authorities intended to recalculate weights every year. The index covers 19 regions (oblasts) and is calculated on a monthly basis; in addition, a provisional index is compiled weekly, based on a smaller basket of consumer goods. The previous producer nrice index, which suffered from a number of deficiencies, has recently been replaced by a new index based on the more appropriate Laspeyres formula and the index has been retroactively corrected for 1994. However, the quality of the underlying price information received from enterprises needs improvement. Also, the weights should be updated to account for shifts in the structure of production. Data on average wages are reported on both a yearly and monthly basis. A monthly household income/expenditure survey is also compiled, containing information on nonwage income. Data on emnlovment cover the material and service sectors. Data on unemployment cover only those who are officially unemployed and receive benefits. There is no official measure of those who are unemployed, actively seeking a job, but have not applied for benefits. The Ministry of Labor has begun to collect some data on hidden unemployment, comprising workers on compulsory leave or enforced part-time status. Most real sector data are published in a monthly statistical bulletin issued by Goskomstat and made available to other government authorities.

Fiscal accounts As a result of extensive technical assistance, a number of improvements have been made to the fiscal data, including the consolidation of a number of formerly extrabudgetary funds into the fiscal accounts (the Pension and Social Insurance Funds, however, remain outside the accounts) and provision of more detailed expenditure data on a quarterly basis. Progress also has been made in the establishment of a government finance statistics classification of the fiscal accounts. However, further work will be needed on the revision of the classification coding system. Other major shortcomings at present involve: (i) the lack of comprehensive data on financing transactions, foreign economic activity, and outstanding government debt, covering all units of government; and (ii) insufficient information on arrears or contingent liabilities of the government arising from guarantees on enterprises' foreign debt. It is expected that the 1996 Budget would be presented in a format consistent with the new classification codes and GFS standards. 3. Monev and banking statistics Substantial progress has been made in compiling monetary statistics based on the revised Gosbank plan of accounts. It should be noted, however, that differences exist between the systems used by EUR II and STA for compiling monetary statistics. A new chart of accounts was introduced in mid-1995 for the National Bank of Kazakstan; the new system will replace the old system beginning in early 1996. The finalization of a new chart of accounts for the commercial banks, which is also needed, is likely to be delayed until sometime in 1996. Other outstanding issues relate to some aspects of the compilation and treatment of central government accounts, the quality of data compiled by the commercial banks, and the accounting of transactions with the IMF. In early 1994, the National Bank of Kazakstan began publishing a monthly bulletin with monetary accounts and credit statistics. 4. Balance of navments While progress has been made in compiling balance of payments statistics, considerable work remains to be done. At present, current account data are collected from customs, enterprise surveys, administrative data, and Goskomstat's own database. Except for direct investment and some data from commercial banks, all data for the capital and financial account are provided by the National Bank of Kazakstan. At the beginning of 1995, the authorities started to prepare both annual and quarterly balance of payments estimates. There are several problems that remain in compiling balance of payments data: (i) the excessive degree of decentralization of data collection has led to concerns regarding quality and methodological consistency; (ii) the banking system reports and data on transportation services are not recorded by residency; (iii) while the switch in 1994 in the data source for trade Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 48 - APPENDIX IV statistics from enterprise surveys to customs data was a positive step, the latter at present suffer from shortcomings in coverage, valuation, and timing of recording, arising mainly from weaknesses in border controls; (iv) the coverage of data for some balance of payments components, including transportation and travel debits and direct investment, needs to be improved by additional surveys and an improvement of existing surveys. The balance of payments is independently compiled by Goskomstat and the NBK. Until October 1995, however, the balance of payments statements prepared by the two agencies showed significant differences. A technical assistance mission in October 1995 reviewed these differences and proposed a single balance of payments presentation. 5. Coordination of statistical agencies In October 1995, a Republican Workinp Commission on Coordination of National Economic Statistics was established to coordinate and strengthen the links between the various agencies involved in the collection and compilation of statistical data, as well as to provide official statistical data on various statistical areas, such as the balance of payments statistics. This commission will help to improve the quality of the economic statistics and to allocate resources more efficiently between the statistical agencies. 6.
