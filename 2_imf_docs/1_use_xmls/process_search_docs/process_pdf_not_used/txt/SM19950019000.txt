The context 0 Kuwait has succeeded in overcoming the damage to its production and infrastructure base caused by the Iraqi occupation; oil production and refining capacity exceed pre-invasion levels. Kuwait has joined the WTO, strengthened its banking regulation and supervision, and maintained a generous external aid program. 0 Inflation remains low, interest rate spreads have narrowed, and the external current account is again in surplus--albeit at a lower level due to the fall in investment income. However, the budget deficit remains excessive, contributing to capital outflows and further reductions in official foreign assets. l The main issue in the financial sector is resolving uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the large debt workout plan (Debt Collection Program--DCP) put in place after the liberation. l Illustrative medium-term scenarios --themselves subject to downside risk on account of oil market volatility- -suggest that in the absence of a significant strengthening of adjustment and reform policies, the economy faces a considerable financing requirement. l In recognition of these challenges, the Five Year Plan currently under preparation appropriately emphasizes eliminating the fiscal deficit; widening the revenue base; enhancing human resource development; and, more broadly, promoting the role of the private sector in production and invest- ment. 2. Policv discussions l The policy discussions covered 4 the timetable for budgetary adjustment; 4 the accompanying structural measures (particularly, in the fiscal, financial and real sectors); and 4 the importance of strengthening the data base supporting economic policy formulation and implementation. l Given the fiscal outlook, the staff supports a more pronounced budgetary adjustment in 1995/96, concurrent with progress on steps to widen the domestic revenue base and reduce outlays in the context of a more ambitious medium-term reform framework.

While unfortunate, the proposed modifications do not penalize those who adhered to the original terms and impose a more regular payment schedule. Resolution of this long- standing issue will require early action on payments delays, should they arise, in the context of strong collection and bankruptcy procedures. 0 Given the structure of the economy, the fiscal adjustment will have a dampening effect on non-oil activity in the short-run. Minimization of this and placement of the economy on a medium-term growth path requires timely implementation of the authorities' privatization and deregulation plans, as well as fiscal measures which reduce wage and cost distortions. l Progress has been marde in restoring and strengthening the data base.

Introduction The staff discussions, for the 1995 Article IV consultation were held in Kuwait during the period July 8-12, 1995. The. staff met with the Governor of the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK); the Undersecretaries at the Ministries of Finance, Oil, and Planning; and. other senior government officials. u Kuwait accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on August 5, 1963. u The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on July 15, 1994. u Executive Directors commended the authorities for the restoration of Kuwait's productive capacity after liberation from the Iraqi occupation. They welcomed the country's open trade and payments system, its maintenance of low inflation, and the generous foreign assistance program. Noting the continued weakness of the fiscal accounts and the adverse implications for official foreign assets, they urged early implementation of strong budgetary adjustment. In this context, and given recent developments in the economy, the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions focussed on three main issues: (i) fiscal adjustment and reform; (ii) resolving uncertainties associated with the large debt workout program (known as the Debt Collection Prograni-- DCP); k/ and (iii) revitalizing the non-oil sector. The discussions benefitted from an improvement in the data base. Nevertheless, weaknesses remain, particularly in the areas of national income, price and fiscal accounts. They relate to statistical systems and insufficient information sharing and coordination among government agencies. The authorities were receptive to the proposals made by khe staff to address these weaknesses (see Section III.5 and Appendix III). II. Backeround 1. Recent develoDments Reflecting careful planning and effective implementation, Kuwait succeeded in quickly repairing its oil facilities and the vast majority of the infrastructure destroyed during the Iraqi occupation. GDP had recovered to above the pre-invasion level by 1994; oil production, exports, and u The staff team consisted of Messrs. El-Erian (Head), Lee, Treichel, Williams, and Wilson (all MED), and Mrs. Lansanah-Richardson (Staff Assistant--MED). Mr. Shaalan (Executive Director) participated in the policy discussions. u Fund relations are summarized in Appendix I and World Bank relations in Appendix II.

I;/ With the restoration of normal supplies, inflation fell and began to reflect to a larger extent developments in import unlit values. At the same time, due to the increase in oil receipts and expenditure containment, the budget deficit fell from 22 percent of GDP in 1992/93 to 14 percent of GDP in 1993/94, while domestic interest rate spreads narrowed significantly relative to U.S. dollar rates (Table 1 and Chart 1). 2/ Nevertheless, the country experi- enced a large reduction in official foreign assets (to a level of KD 10.2 billion, or USS34.5 billion, at end-June 1994) u and increases in domestic debt (to the equivalent of 87 percent of GDP at end-June 1994, including D,CP bonds), and external debt (to 26 percent of GDP). The budget deficit fell further in 1994/95 to 9.4 percent of GDP (Table 2). A sharp rise.in oil receipt:; due to higher international prices was reinforced by expenditure reduction and larger non-oil revenues associated with income tax on foreign corporations and customs duties--both resulting from the continued normalization of economic activity. The reduction in the deficit would have been greater were it not for outlays associated with the heightened military alert in October 1994. It contributed to a further improvement in the external current account which reached a surplus of 12,2 percent of GNI? in 1994. Money supply growth amounted to 5.9.percent in 1994,.with the expansion in net domestic assets being slightly offset by lower net fore:Lgn assets (Table 3). ,Notwithstanding these improvements, Kuwait's situation continued to call for a strengthening of the main financial aggregates. A substantial budgetary financing requirement and continued large outflows of private capital (associated mainly with excessive liquidity injections through the budget) contributed to an estimated balance.of payments deficit of USS1.8 billion in 1994 (Table 4). The financial imbalance was accompanied by structural weaknesses, particularly in the fiscal and financial sectors. Thus, with the reduction in investment :Lncome, Kuwait's revenue structure is now more highly dependent on oil receipts. This accentuates the contrast to the situation in the 1980s when the share of oil receipts amounted to around 60 percent of total revenue compared to about 75 percent in 1993/94-1994/95, placing Kuwait among the most dependent of the "oil producing economies" on oil receipts (Chart 2). On the expenditure side, three categories (wages 3;/ Oil production amounted to 2.0 million barrels a day (mbd) in the first half of 1995, with production and refining capacities of 2.5 mbd and 0.8 mbd, respectively. Recoverable crude oil reserves are estimated at some 96.5 billion barrels. u Fiscal accounts are on a July/June basis; national accounts and balance of payments data are reported on a calendar year basis. 1/ This covers the foreign assets of the CBK and fully recoverable foreign assets managed by the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) under the Reserve Fund for Future Generations. It does not include the foreign assets of public sector entities such as the Public Authority for Social Security, the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, and the Kuwait Fund.

Distortions resulting from inappropriate pricing of goods and services provided by the public sector, and a wage structure strongly favoring government employment, also have contributed to inefficiencies. Finally, uncertainties relating to the implementation of the DCP have weakened the financial intermediation process at a time when related bond obligations account for a significant portion of banks' total domestic assets (Chart 3). u The Kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a basket of currencies in which the U.S. dollar has an important weight. Given the depreciation of the dollar vis-a- vis other major currencies, the nominal and real effective exchange rates of the Kuwaiti dinar are estimated to have depreciated by 7.9 percent,and 2.3 percent, respectively, during the first ten months of 1994/95 (Chart 4). Kuwait joined the WTO in 1994 and is a member of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (CCC). 2/ It maintains an exchange and trade system which is free of restrictions u and a generous aid program under which annual disbursements are well ,above. the United Nations' target. 2. Medium-term scenarios highlight the challenges facing the economy in the absence of a significant strengthening of the adjustment and reform effort (Table 5 and Appendix IV). Consistent with WEO-based projections for the oil market and interest rates, oil revenues would edge up slowly and be offset by a steady drop in investment ,income. Expenditure would increase as savings on DCP interest payments and certain military outlays are offset by increasing pressures from the wage and benefit bill, subsidies and transfer payments. As a result, the budgetary financing requirements (including external loan repayments and payments corresponding to part of the debt forgiveness component of the DCP) would be substantial, totaling over KD 6 billion in 1995/96-2000/01; a significant part of this (some 40 percent) would fall due in 1995/96-1996/97 reflecting the scheduled repayment of the post-liberation USS5.5 billfon bank loan syndication. In the absence of corrective policies, these requirements would imply a combination of drawing down foreign assets, using existing export credit lines (USS5.2 billion, of which USSO. billion has been utilized as of end-June 1995,), and, possibly, resorting to new foreign borrowing. u See Box 1 for a description of the DCP. u Other members of the CCC are Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. u Kuwait maintains restrictions vis-a-vis the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and Iraq in accordance with Executive Board Decision No. 144.

Moreover;it is not consistent with the authorities' announced intention to enhance. private sector' activities. It should,also be noted:that the outlook is subject' t‘o significatit downside risk due to (i) oil market uncertainties, including thi potential-impact of Iraq's‘ return to the market; u,and (ii) pdtetitial slippages in repayments by'the' private sector of debts covered bjr the DCP'.' ';- .' : '. : III. &eDort on the&J&v Discussions The authorities recognize' the importance of timely corrective measures to .reduce .financial'imbalances and structural weaknesses. The Five-Year Plan currently'under preparation emphasizes' fiscal deficit reduction, widenPng the revenue base, enhancing humai-.resource development, and, more broadly;.promoting the role of the private Sector in production and invest- ment. These are key aspects .if the economy is to provide self-sustaining. employniint opportunities for the increasing, number-of nationals entering the labor force. Accordingly, the policy discussions addressed: * the timetable for fiscal adjustment and refdrm;,. 0 the accompanying measures in the financial, etternal, and real sectors; and _/ '. : , * the importance of strengthening the data base. supporting economic policy formulatioti and imp;lementation. 'i 1. Fiscal adiustm&t and reforg! The authorities' medium-term fiscial plan calls for the elimination of the deficit by 1999/2000.' The'proposed budget for 1995/96 targets a deficit of 8 percent of GDP; using staff,projections based on WE0 oil price assump- tions and only a marginal ‘increase in export volume, 'the deficit amounts to 8.3 percent of GDP.

This would be accompanied by correspondingly lower expenditure due to the-nonrecurrence of outlays associated with the October 1994 military alert, reduced spending on military equipment, lower interest payments on foreign debt, and a reduction in the wage and salary bi:Ll due to the elimination of some positions. u A variation of US$l per barrel in international oil prices translates, ceteris paribus, 'into a U!j$O.7 billion chrirlge in Kuwait's annual export receipts.

The assessment of its overall appro- priateness, however, raises a principal question: the extent to which the budget is consistent with the required medium-term fiscal correction in terms of both pace of deficit reduction and structural improvements. Given Kuwait's vulnerable fiscal structure, the medium-term policy effort needs to draw on measures from a broad menu which includes, on the revenue side: (i) significantly higher fees and charges on goods and services provided by the public sector; (ii) imposition of a general sales tax; (iii) upward adjustments in external tariff rates (from their current O-4 percent levels) and removal of exemptions, consistent with GCC and WTO commitments; and (iv) introduction of income tax on individuals and Kuwaiti companies. On the expenditure side, the menu includes: (i) lower personnel costs through both actions on wages and benefits (the latter being split off from the wage bill) and reduction in public sector employment; (ii) reduced subsidies and transfers; (iii) further containment of outlays on goods and services, with emphasis on low-productivity activities; and (iv) transfer of public sector functions through privatization and allowing the private sector to enter activities previously reserved for the public sector. In addition to the direct effects, such measures have important indirect effects. Revenues would be enhanced through the lower drawdown of foreign assets; moreover, within the overall deficit and expenditure reduction program, a higher level of public investment could be sustained. The phasing of measures should make allowances for two factors: (i) the need to prepare for the smooth introduction and administration of new taxes; and (ii) the importance of frontloading the deficit reduction effort. The staff discussed with the authorities an illustrative scenario involving a selection of items from the menu, consistent with the authori- ties' objective to eliminate the fiscal deficit in 1999/2000 (Chart 5). With both revenue and expenditure steps contributing to the deficit reduction effort, the financing requirement falls considerably--by some KD 4 billion compared to the initial scenario. Nevertheless, the gradual elimination of the deficit over a five-year period still exposes the economy to significant risks of disruptions. The alternative illustrative adjustment scenario targeted the elimina- tion of the deficit in 1997/98 through a more forceful tax and expenditure reduction effort. This results in a smaller cumulative budget deficit over the scenario period as a whole. Related potential beneficial effects of the more ambitious adjustment scenario include higher medium-term growth reflecting, inter alia, the acceleration of measures to remove price and wage distortions; there would also be a greater positive impact on private capital flows. This would serve to minimize the risk of disruptions to confidence in Kuwait's exchange and payments system at a time of significant uncertainty regarding oil market prospects. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - Viewing the 1995/96 budget in the medium-term framework, the staff stressed the importance of making a more aetermined adjustment involving greater emphasis on measures to improve the structure of the budget-- particularly given the risk of downward revisions in projected oil prices and the already considerable implied drawdown in foreign assets. It recommended that consideraltion be given to increasing fees and charges, lowering the wage and benefit bill, and additional expenditure containment. This would provide a firmer basis for more fundamental tax reforms that need to be implemented in 1996/'97, the preparation for which should be advanced during the current fiscal year. The Kuwaiti authorities,indicated that the intention to eliminate the fiscal deficit by 1999/2000 did not necessarily preclude a more ambitious adjustment, provided socio-political conditions were appropriate. They added that consideration was being given to additional deficit reduction in 1995/96 through higher charges for public services (particularly, electricity and certain health and educational services) and further containment of spending on wages and benefits and on subsidies and transfers. They noted that preparatory work had been initiated in the area of tax reforms. 2. Monetarv nolicv While fiscal policy holds the key to a sustainable improvement in Kuwait's economic outlook, monetary po!Licy also has a role to play in minimizing short-term disruptions and strengthening the basis for the mobilization and allocation of funds in support of private sector growth. Two aspects are important in this regard: the satisfactory implementation of the DCP and further enhancement of market-based attributes of the financial sector. Modifications to the DCP became unavoidable in view of concerns about the impact on the economy of the bunching of large scheduled payments (KD 2.3 billion, equivalent to USS7.8 billion) to be made within‘the June- September period under the original terms of the program. Accordingly, the Government has submitted to the National Assembly proposals to extend the amortization period, combined with the imposition of interest charges and the requirement to make installment payments. While in view of the moral hazard risk it is unfortunate that further modifications needed to be made, the changes submitted.to the National Assembly involve favorable aspects. First, the imposition of fixed payment installments for the early discount pa:yment option (by far the most impor- tant one quantitatively) can serve to avoid the bunching problem. Second, by avoiding a significant change in the net present value of the discount payment option, the modifications do not penalize those who adhered to the original terms.

More generally, the determine,d implementation of the DCP would play a significant role in alleviating uncertainties that have adversely impacting. financial intermediation and in re.ducing:budgetary outlays. , Domestic liauidity,grew by 7.3 percent in the first five months of 1995 as compared to 5.9 percent for 1994 as a whole. Although rapid, there are several factors which suggest that this increase reflected underlying favorable shifts in the demand for money involving, inter alia, .the restoration qf pre-invasion tendencies (such as the continued recovery in foreign currency deposits held in, the domestic banking system). The repatriation of capital for participation in future privatization offers and the broadening of bank services may have also.been contributing factors. Given the.preliminary nature of the data on these various aspects,.the authorities agreed with the staff on the importance of careful monitoring to pre-empt any potential pressures on the external accounts. .' . ,.

The next step shouId involve the removal of the remaining ceiling on rates on long-term lending. This would,facilitate,bank financPng of a wide range of productive activities in a transparent and nondistortionary manner. While recognizing the arguments in favor of such liberalization, the authorities indicated that their main 'emphasis ai present was, to improve the overall environment, particularly sincle the! ceiling did not appear to be binding at this stage. Turning to &zulatorv and suDervi.sorv issues., the CBK strengthened further in the last year rules and procedures governing bank credit concentlation, money laundering activi,ties, on-site examination (of banks and exchange and investment companies), and mutual fund operations. The authorities saw no.c&flict at this stage between t?e CBK's monetary policy role and its expanding.activi.ties. in supenrising.non-bank financial institutions, and will keep this issue under consideration. '. 3. External sector issues Notwithstanding the recent weakening in international'oil;prices, export receipts are expectzed to be somewhat higher than in 1994 reflecting the strengthening of oil prices earlier in,the year (Chart 6). With the reduction in imports resulting from lower government spending and a fall in the deficit on service and transfer transactions, the current account surplus improves to 14.4 percent of GNI?.' By contr'ast, the capital account position worsens substantially due to the US$2;4 bi'llion amortization payments on account of the bank loan. Consequently, the overall balance of: pavments would record a de!ficit of USS3.3 billion, twice the level of 1994. A further increase in the deficit is projected in 1996 reflecting the remaining loan amortization payments. Thereafter', the deficit falls sharply, albeit still involving considerable financing requirements under the no-policy change .scenario. The' balance of payments deficit would be eliminated under the two illustrative adjustment scenarios, with the more ambitious scenario prdvidi.ng for higher imports (consistent with the growth projections), reduced net priva‘te capitzal outflows, and & lower cumulative financing requirement. The authorities informed the staff that, given the comfortable level of foreign assets, they had no 'intention t:o resort to new loans to finance the prospective balance of payments deficitzs.' External debt ffnancing will be limited to the utilization of.already-eqtablished export credit ltnes; 'They stressed that all amortiiation obligations.on the bank loan syndication will be made as sche.duled, with the first installment having been repaid in June. As regards foreien asset manaeemer&, the authorities informed the staff that within an unchanged overall approach, Kuwait's foreign asset portfolio changes have involved greater emphasis on the KIA's role as a financial Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public40 35 30 25 20 15 10 cHNm6 PETROLEUM SPFFRICE, 1989-95 (US. dollars per barrel) I I I I I I _.- i I 35 30 25 20 15 10 1989 1990 Source: International financial Statistics. 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicDownload Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - investor rather than as a manager. Accordingly, there had been a shift away from large direct investments with management exposure and toward smaller financial participation. Turning to exchange rate Dolicy; the authorities observed that their approach will continue to strike a balance between stabilizing the nominal effective exchange rate and minimizing variability in Kuwait's main source of budgetary revenue, which is denominated in U.S. dollars. This task has been rendered difficult by considerable fluctuations among the main industrial country currencies. As a result, while fluctuations in the bilateral KD/U.S. dollar have been maintained within a narrow range, the nominal effective exchange rate has been subject to relatively large variability (see Chart 4). Looking forward, the authorities indicated their intention to maintain the current exchange rate policy. Responsibility for reducing domestic absorption will fall on.fiscal retrenchment, with the exchange rate being used as a broad nominal anchor--thereby also minimizing disruptions to confidence in the financial system. Recent efforts at regional economic integration in the GCC context aim at exploiting welfare-enhancing opportunities in the trade and financial sectors. The authorities noted that such policies are consistent with efforts at multilateral liberalization of trade in goods and services. Tl=Y welcomed the establishment of the WTO as, inter alia, it strengthened the institutional framework supporting trade liberalization. They regretted that while Kuwait maintained a restriction-free trade system, its exports faced considerable protectionist measures in major markets. They expressed the hope that multilateral trade liberalization efforts would lead to a reduction of taxes on petrochemical and related products. 4. Real sector policies Given the particularly heavy dependence of the private sector on government outlays, the required fiscal adjustment will have a dampening effect on real sector activity in the short term. This effect could be minimized by moving aggressively on structural reform policies--policies that are key to sustain medium-term growth consistent with the need to provide employment opportunities for the growing number of Kuwaitis entering the labor market. Accordingly, and while recognizing limitations to diversification associated with the country's resource endowment and population issues, the staff welcomed the emphasis being placed in the proposed Five Year Plan on promoting private sector activities through deregulation, a correction of distortions, and human resource development. As noted earlier, several of the measures required for fiscal adjust- ment also help remove distortions that have undermined efficient private sector investment, growth, and employment. The intensification of the privatization program in 1995 provides a good basis for its intended expansion to major utilities (starting with telecommunications in 1996) and other large corporations (such as Kuwait Airways) and needs to be supported by a strengthening of the regulatory 'regime. The beneficial impact on the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - economy will be reinforced by the use of the proceeds to bolster official assets. In addition, the program could p1ay.a role in attracting foreign investment--provided steps are taken to liberalize entry into the domestic equity market-- and in encouraging capital repatriation. Finally, there is a need to address the large wage differentials that favor the public sector, where about 97 percent of the Kuwaiti labor force is employed. The Plan also identifies the Offset Proeram and--Free Trade Zones as instruments for promoting private sector activities, JJ The staff cautioned the authorities against placing much reliance on these instruments. In effect, the proposed expansion of the Offset Program to civilian projects could serve to obfuscate the pricing of contracts with limited investment additionality. Meanwhile, given conditions in Kuwait and the region, free trade zones could introduce an important risk of customs revenue leakage with little net beneficial impact on domestic activity. Turning to population issues, the Plan aims at increasing the ratio of Kuwaitis in the work force from 16 percent to 19 percent. y Consistent with this, the authorities intend to limit the immigration of low-skilled expatriates. The income-related restriction on entry of expatriate families into Kuwait has been replaced by fees for individual family members. As regards the oil sector, the authorities indicated their intention to increase production capacity to 3.0 mbd by the year 2000 and refining capacity to 0.9 mbd. Production levels will continue to be governed by the OPEC ceiling (currently 2 mbd). In this regard, the authorities indicated that they will soon seek an increase in the ceiling to restore parity with similar producers within OPEC. Steps taken to allow foreign investment and private sector participa- tion in petrochemical activities have played an important role in enhancing the availability of financing. The staff also welcomed measures being taken to diversify downstream activities in foreign countries. The authorities added that consideration was being given to liberalizing foreign entry to drilling and exploration activities. Such a policy would reinforce the current trend emphasizing the private sector as the main engine of growth supported by foreign investment. 5. Statistical issues Progress had been made over the past year in strengthening the data base, as detailed in Appendix III. However, weaknesses remain, resulting in an information system that falls short of the requirements of a modern open 1/ Under the Offset Program, foreign firms that are awarded government contracts are required to invest 30 percent of the contract value in joint- ventures with Kuwaiti-owned firms. 2/ Kuwait's population, which amounte,d to 2.0 million in 1989, is esti- mated at about 1.8 million in mid-1994, Iwith a 60 percent expatriate share.

These weaknesses relate to the statistical systems (including the impact of the -occupation) and insufficient information sharing and coordination among government agencies. There are problems, in particular, with national income, prices, and fiscal series. Based on discussions with government officials and drawing on the 1994 STA technical assistance mission, the staff discussed with the authorities an Action Plan to strengthen data. The authorities expressed their intention to follow up on this plan. They also welcomed the staff's proposal that a high level multi-agency committee be put in place to address coordination problems within Kuwait that inhibit the timely preparation of statistics needed for policy analysis and formulation. They also agreed to enhance the flow of information to the Fund in-between consultations through regular reporting of some data not previously covered in the periodic submission to IFS. IV. Staff Aporaisal Kuwait made impressive progress in overcoming the severe damage and disruptions caused by the Iraqi occupation. Oil production and exports were quickly restored and now exceed pre-invasion levels, as does refining capacity. The fiscal deficit was reduced while domestic interest rate spreads narrowed significantly. The external current account resumed its traditional surplus-- albeit well below the pre-invasion levels due to the erosion of investment income --and Kuwait's generous external assistance program was maintained. These developments materialized in the context of low inflation and were accompanied by a further strengthening of prudential regulation and supervision of the financial system, accession to the WTO, and progress in the privatization program. The staff commends the authorities on these significant achievements which enable Kuwait to perform its important role in the regional.and international economy. The achievements need to be built on if Kuwait is to address effectively the important challenges that still confront the economy. These relate essentially to: the still excessive budget deficit, which is projected to grow over the medium term in the absence of policy measures; weak structural aspects in the context of an outlook for interna- tional oil prices which is subject to significant downside risk; and uncertainty associated with the DCP. If not addressed, these factors will cause an additional loss of foreign assets, increase the economy's dependence on oil, and reduce further its ability to withstand adverse developments in the oil market. The resulting impact on private sector confidence will undermine the outlook for non-oil GDP, exacerbating the challenge the economy faces in providing self-sustaining jobs for the growing number of nationals entering the labor market. The intensification of Kuwait's adjustment and reform efforts in a medium-term framework involves three main aspects: First, a reduction in the budget deficit through measures aimed at expanding the domestic revenue Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 1:2 - base and rationalizing expenditures. Second, the continued conduct of a prudent monetary policy characterized by market-based policies and supported by a strengthening of the financial intermediation process. Third, intensifying structural reforms efforts. The staff welcomes the authorities' plan to eliminate the budget deficit by 1999/2000 and their openness to a potentially more ambitious adjustment timetable. Consistent with this approach, the staff supports a more pronounced deficit reduction effort in 1995/96 to be attained through measures that address structural weaknesses in both revenue and expenditure components. As regards financial intermediation, the staff notes that what unfortunately became unavoidable modifications to the DCP contain several elements to limit moral hazard. Given the need to resolve the uncertainty associated with the DCP--an uncertainty that has already lingered for too long- -the staff emphasizes the importance of decisive implementation of the procedures, including early action on payment delays should they emerge. The staff also supports supplementing recent action to liberalize the financial system by the removal of the remaining ceiling on lending rates. Given the structure of the economy, particularly the heavy dependence of the private sector on government outlays, elements of adjustment and reform will have a dampening effect on ;:he n.on-oil sector in the short run. This is of concern given the already weak state of this sector. However, there is no alternative if Kuwait is to have the foundation for self- sustaining medium-term investment and growth. Indeed, several of the required fiscal measures address structural weaknesses that adversely affect efficiency and economic activity in the private sector. The more timely their implementation, the more quickly the economy can be placed on a higher growth path. To reinforce this process, the staff welcomes the intensification of the privatization, deregulation, and human resource development measures. These need to be supported by actions to reduce distortions that favor government employment. Kuwait's continued commitment to an open exchange and trade system and to its generous foreign assistance program is commendable. The staff recognizes the balance that the authorities are striking in their exchange rate policy between minimizing fluctuations in the effective exchange rate and maintaining relative stability in government income. The staff supports the continued implementation of Kuwait's exchange rate arrangement which pegs the dinar to a basket of currencies in which the U.S. dollar has an important weight. The staff welcomes the progress made by Kuwait in restoring and strengthening the data base. This, together with enhanced transmittal of data to the Fund, will facilitate effective surveillance. Nevertheless, data deficiencies remain, especially in the areas of national income, prices, and fiscal accounts. The staff recommends that further actions be taken along the lines indicated in the Action Plan to strengthen statistical systems, including steps to improve coordination and information flows among government agencies.

During the Iraqi occupation, the Government requested Bank assistance in formulating a strategic framework for reconstruction following liberation. In January 1991, the Bank submitted to the Government a three- volume set of reports entitled Kuwait: Emernencv Relief Pronram that included action plans and draft procurement documentation. In addition, the Bank discussed with the authorities a preliminary study on Human Resources Development of Kuwait (Report No. 9372-KU, February 8, 1991). In November 1991, the Government requested further technical assistance under the Technical Cooperation Program to study the transfer of some public sector activities to the private sector:. A Bank team visited Kuwait during May 1993, and investigated privatization of the industrial, services, health, telecommunications, power, ports, and transport sectors. The resulting study, Kuwait: A Privatization Stratenv (in 4 volumes, green cover) was delivered to the Ministry of Finance in November 1993, and subsequently was submitted to the Council of Ministers. In June 1994, a Bank mission visited Kuwait to.prepare a Country Econmic Memorandum (CEM). In March 1995, a copy of the CEM (green cover) was sent to the Government. The focus of the GEM was on **four key development issues with a view of making policy recommendations: (i) the role of Government and public sector productivity; (ii) fiscal policies and public saving; (iii) welfare and subsidization; and (iv) the labor market and employment policies." In the fall of 1994, the Bank assisted a delegation from the Parliament in learning of worldwide e:xperience in the implementation of privatization, and most recently the Bank is assisting the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) in the disposition of its assets.

It provided the input into the Statistical Action Plan prepared by the staff focusing on the main areas of data weaknesses, particularly in the areas of national income, prices, and fiscal accounts. The appendix reflects discussions with the authorities and updates the findings of the 1994 STA technical assistance mission. 1. National accounts While improvements have been made in restoring the data base after liberation (namely, up-to-date nominal GDP series and resumption of work on the constant price series), up-to-date constant price GDP statistics are still not available; the latest available estimates are annual information for 1992. The slow improvement in the development of GDP constant price series was largely due to lack of resources, as well as the absence of timely reporting from key agencies. Its correction requires a shift of resources concurrent with improved coordination between the Ministries of Planning, Oil, and Finance and an enhanced survey approach. 2. Price statistics A lengthy delay is occurring in restoring the consumer price index (CPI) to an up-to-date basis, and the latest monthly data are for June 1993. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) has made an ad hoc estimate of the change in the CPI index for the six-month period July-December 1993, as well as the for the change in the index for calendar year 1994. As in the case of the CPI, the CSO made annual estimates of the wholesale price index (WPI) for 1993 and 1994, as well as for 1990 through 1992. The failure to restore the regular WPI series is also a matter of concern. While monthly surveys of wholesale prices of goods have also been carried out regularly since the liberation, no monthly indexes have been released. The WPI also needs to be converted to a more modern statistical measure, such as a producer price index (PPI), which is also more useful for national accounting needs. Kuwait has no import price index as an alternative approximate indicator. Main corrective actions need to focus on (i) improving the coordination between the Computer Processing Department and the CSO with regard to the processing of CPI survey data; (ii) implementing the system of catch-up processing of CPI survey data recommended by the 1994 STA mission; and (iii) compiling a producer price index. 3. Government finance statistics Government finance statistics suffer from gaps in reporting as well as misclassifications. In addition, the lack of a suitable classification of data on the execution of the budget precludes the possibility of monitoring Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 212 - APPENDIX III effectively fiscal developments during the year. Most of the weaknesses stem from limitations on the sharing of information between various government agencies, including the KIA. 4. Monev and banking statistics The authorities indicated to the staff that publication of the new, expanded Monetary Survey (covering all "local banks"), as recommended by the STA mission, is imminent. Within the next two months these data will appear in the CBK's Monthlv Monetarv Review and also in the Quarterlv Bulletin. Although some work remains on investment company statistical reports before a separate table for these institutions can be published, data from the few such companies that accept deposits from the public likewise will be included in the new CBK tables as part of a new M3 aggregate. Within a few months, CBK staff will make some decision ablout future steps on publishing investment company balance sheets and fashioning the Banking Survey. 5. Balance of navments statistics Over the past year, and in line with the recommendations of the STA mission, there has been closer cooperation between the staff of the Central Bank and KIA with regard to identifying changes in the official foreign reserves and investment income. The KIA will soon be able to provide more timely data on official foreign assets once the computerization of its data base is completed. Furthermore, KIA's d.ata base will be more comprehensive in that it will include changes in foreign assets held by other public entities, such as Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) and Kuwait Airways. While several of the STA mission's recommendations have been implemented, a few problem areas remain to be tackled. First, estimating data on workers' remittances using data from the exchange companies is not yet possible, since in their monthly transactions reports filed with the CBK these companies report only transactions of remittances that exceed KD 10,000. The CBK plans to improve the data reporting of the exchange companies in the future. Second, the CBK faces two obstacles in implementing the direct investment surveys, namely, resource constraints and unsatisfactory response from these enterprises. Third, with regard to the inadequate data on income and capital flows of Kuwait's insurance companies, consultations will be held 'between the CBK and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to find ways to overcome the difficulties of obtaining regular information from insurance companies. Fourth, the CBK faces a number of impediments in the implementation of quarterly balance of payments accounts, including unavailability of oil and official investment figures.

The scenarios, which are calculated on a calendar year basis, illustrate medium-term prospects under: (i) a no policy change scenario; (ii) a fiscal adjustment that would eliminate the deficit by the year 1999/:2000 (Scenario I); and (iii) a stronger adjustment effort which would eliminate the deficit by the year 1997/98 (Scenario II). The intensity of structural reforms are assumed to parallel the intensity of the fiscal adjustment effort. I. Underlytpg: AssumDtions 1. Real GDP and deflatcz: Oil GDP growth is assumed to grow in tandem with oil production. The non-oil GDP component is influenced mainly by the fiscal stimulus around an underlying growth trend which is influenced, inter alia, by gains in efficiency that result from the structural reforms and adjustment of prices on services provided by the Government. The non-oil deflator is assumed to move in line with Kuwait's import unit values, adjusted by price changes on services provided by the Government and the tax system. The Kuwaiti. dinar is assumed to remain stable against the U.S. dollar. 2. Crude oik: Crude oil exports are based on: (i) a gradual increase in Kuwait's OPEC quota to 2.:3 million barrels per day (mbd) by 1999 in line with anticipated growth in demand for OPEC oil; and (ii) an increase in the share of exports of refined products following refinery capacity expansion from 780 thousand barrels per day (tbd) to 900 tbd by the year 2000. Average oil prices are assumed to move in tandem with the IMF's WE0 projection (June 19, 1995) taking into account the differential for the Kuwaiti mix. 3. Trade balance: The value of non-oil exports reflects the expected coming on-stream of the large petroche:mical plant in 1998. Imports are assumed to be determined by two variables: (i) government expenditure on goods and non-interest services and capital expenditure, and (ii) private sector consumption and investment. 4. Investment income and navments: Government investment income follows the projected evolution of official foreign assets and international interest rates. Government interest payments are calculated according to the terms of the USS5.5 billion bank borrowing and ‘buyer’s credit arrangements. No further foreign bank borrowing by the Government is assumed, except for utilization of official buyer's credits. Interest income of, and payments by, financial institutions are estimated from the change in their foreign assets and liabilities, respectively. .Other private investment income is based on a cumulative stock of private capital outflows derived from errors and omissions, starting from IL990. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - APPENDIX IV 5. Private transfers: Workers' remittances are assumed to increase in tandem with the expected path of the number of expatriate workers--which again is determined by the level of economic activity. 6. External canital account: Loan disbursements by the Kuwait Fund are expected to be in the range of 50-60 percent of annual commitments of KD 150 million. Direct and portfolio investment of the Kuwait Fund, financial investment institutions and the specialized banks are expected to continue to rise modestly over the medium-term. Repayment of the USS5.5 billion bank loan is assumed to take place in accordance with the original agreement. Private capital outflows are estimated on the basis of evolving velocity (reflecting financial deepening) where it is assumed that any excess liquidity in the domestic financial market will flow out through the balance of payments. II. Policv AssumDtions 1. Fiscal accounts (i) PO ~olicv chanpe scenario This scenario is based on the assumption that the present fiscal policy stance remains broadly unchanged in the medium-term. In particular, it entails no changes to the tax system. Most items in current expenditure are assumed to be constant in real per capita terms. Interest payments on the DCP bonds are based on the current interest rate and a path of outstanding debt assuming full adherence to the proposed modified terms. Interest payments on T-bills and T-bonds are based on the currently outstanding stock and the interest rates payable on these instruments. (ii) Scenario I: Fiscal balance bv FY 1999/2000 This scenario is based on the assumption that the fiscal deficit will be eliminated by 1999/2000 based on a combination of revenue base broadening and expenditure containment policies. These include tariff reform, broadening of the domestic tax base (e.g., general sales tax), subsidy reduction (electricity, water, petroleum, and food), and wage and transfer reductions. Capital expenditure is assumed to be somewhat higher than in the no policy scenario. (iii) Scenario II: Fiscal balance bv FY 1997/98 This scenario targets the elimination of the budget deficit by 1997/98 through a more forceful revenue and expenditure effort. The process is aided by the lower implied drawdown in foreign assets and the correspondingly higher investment income throughout the period.

Structural adiustments Other assumed reforms to promote ,private sector activities comprise privatization, deregulation, wage reform, and raising charges and fees on government services, which would go han'd in hand with the fiscal objectives. Under the no policy change scenario, it is assumed that no substantial structural reforms take place. In scenarios I and II, while the scope of the structural reforms will be similar, the phasing is assumed to follow the fiscal adjustment efforts.
