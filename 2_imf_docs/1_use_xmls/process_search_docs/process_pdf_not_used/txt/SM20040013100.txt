The mission comprised Ms. Creane (head), Messrs. Joly, Mottu, and Wilson, and Mrs. Buenaobra (Assistant) (all MCD), Ms. Rahman (PDR), and Mrs. Kandil (INS). Mr. Shadman-Valavi (MCD) and Mr. Kanaan (Alternate Executive Director) joined the policy discussions. A November 2003 staff visit provided an initial assessment of economic and policy developments. The mission met with Minister of Finance Al-Hussein, Minister of Economy and Trade El-Rifai, Central Bank Governor Kabbarah, and other senior government officials. It also met with private sector and public and private bank representatives. • At the conclusion of the 2002 Article IV consultation on February 24, 2003, Executive Directors commended the Syrian authorities for pursuing sound demand management policies and structural reforms in the banking, fiscal, trade, and foreign exchange areas in 2001–02. These policies contributed to low inflation, exchange rate stability, and strengthened external balances. Directors cautioned, however, that some imbalances, as reflected in the widening of the non-oil fiscal deficit and the significant increase in the money supply, may be present. In addition, a number of distortions still hamper the efficient operation of the economy and prevent Syria from achieving its considerable growth potential. • Although there have been some improvements in the statistical database and transmission of data to the Fund, major weaknesses remain with regard to the periodicity, timeliness, coverage, and quality of data in all sectors, mainly due to capacity constraints. These weaknesses hamper the staff’s ability to conduct economic analysis and effective surveillance. • Syria continues to avail itself of the transitional provisions of Article XIV, and maintains exchange measures that are subject to the Fund’s approval under Article VIII.  • The authorities have not indicated their intentions regarding publication of the staff report and PIN. • The principal authors of this report are Ms. Creane and Mr. Mottu.

However, growth remains moderate, unemployment high, and the fiscal situation is deteriorating. The economy is heavily dependent on oil and agriculture and is therefore exposed to unpredictable developments in the world oil market and rainfall. Oil reserves are expected to be depleted within 10–15 years, absent new discoveries. Despite reforms introduced over the past decade, the economy remains government-controlled, and private activity is not a major driver of growth.   Against this background, the economic reform momentum picked up in the second half of 2003 as the authorities pursued a program aimed at encouraging private activity while maintaining a significant role for the state. Key measures taken include: (i) opening the first private banks in 40 years, (ii) reducing interest rates, the first change in 22 years; (iii) eliminating the export surrender requirement; (iv) reducing the number of official exchange rates; (v) passing anti-money laundering legislation; and (vi) reforming the income tax, including cutting sharply the top marginal rate. However, constraints on forward reform movement remain, including major database weaknesses and limited technical capacity.  Policy issues   The discussions focused on macroeconomic policies and reform priorities that would promote private activity, improve growth prospects, and reduce vulnerabilities and reliance on oil while maintaining price stability.    On macroeconomic policies, the staff noted that the current expansionary fiscal stance could lead to excessive demand pressures and an accumulation of government debt, raising medium-term sustainability issues. Implicit subsidies suggested significant quasi-fiscal deficits and a weak public enterprise sector. An additional concern was the budget’s reliance on oil revenue. At the same time, the authorities’ efforts to improve tax revenue through introducing a value-added tax (VAT) were welcome. The staff supported continuation of the exchange rate peg, but urged accelerated movement toward unification of the exchange rate, current account convertibility, and tariff reform. While welcoming the recent easing of monetary policy, staff cautioned the authorities to take appropriate measures should inflationary pressures emerge, and encouraged the rapid development of indirect monetary policy instruments.  The staff welcomed the government’s economic reform program and steps taken to date, but observed that a further broad-based acceleration of the pace of reform would be needed to achieve higher private sector-led growth and reduce unemployment significantly. Rapid action was also needed on completing the banking sector regulatory and supervision Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 6 -     structure, improving fiscal management, and upgrading economic and financial statistics,  which currently hamper effective surveillance.   The authorities generally agreed with the recommendations of the staff and requested technical assistance in areas critical to progress on the reform program, including tax policy, budget management, statistics, and training.

The current macroeconomic situation in Syria is stable, but significant vulnerabilities cloud the outlook (Figures 1–2). The economy is characterized by external current account surpluses, relatively low external debt, and a comfortable international reserve position. Inflation, while beginning to rise, remains low. However, economic growth is moderate, unemployment remains high (at about 15 percent), and the fiscal situation is deteriorating. Syria is heavily dependent on oil receipts and agriculture, and therefore vulnerable to unpredictable developments in the world oil market and in rainfall. At the same time, oil reserves are small and expected to be depleted within 10–15 years at current extraction rates, absent new discoveries. While economic growth has recovered from the poor performance of the late 1990s, it has not regained the high rates averaging 8 percent achieved in the first half of the decade, when economic reforms were first introduced. Notwithstanding the reform measures introduced gradually since then, Syria remains a government-controlled economy with a restrictive trade system and multiple exchange rates. Private activity, although vibrant in some sectors, has not been a major driver of economic growth.  2. In September 2003, President Bashar Al-Assad appointed a new cabinet tasked with accelerating administrative and economic reforms while fighting corruption. Since then, the economic reform momentum has picked up, with increasingly widespread acceptance of the need for change. However, the challenges in moving away from central planning are significant. While turning toward greater reliance on market mechanisms, the government has made clear that a significant role for the state, not yet clearly identified, is to be maintained. Social and political constraints and special interests may complicate reforms in some areas. Technical capacity is highly limited across all ministries and the central bank, and the existing macroeconomic database does not provide reliable information for decision-making. 3. The consultation discussions took place against the complex backdrop of renewed tensions with the United States and Israel in the aftermath of the war in Iraq, and the successful conclusion of trade negotiations with the European Union (EU). Tensions with Israel picked up following an air raid into Syria in October 2003, while  Real GDP Growth, 1990-2003 (Annual percent change)MENA -50510151990199219941996199820002002Developing CountriesSyriaReal GDP growth has slowed since the late 1990's.

On the positive side, negotiations with the EU on an Association Agreement—aiming at progressive introduction of free trade—were concluded in December 2003 at the technical level.1   4. Fund surveillance in recent years has focused on policies to increase growth, reduce fiscal imbalances, and improve the economic database. During consultations, the Fund has urged the authorities to adopt reforms that would remove impediments to private investment, notably by simplifying the trade and exchange systems, eliminating price distortions, and developing a more comprehensive reform framework covering these areas. The direction of the authorities’ economic policies has been broadly in line with these recommendations. Differences have mainly been related to the pace of reform, which has been slow due to institutional and capacity constraints and the absence of political consensus.  Text Table 1. Fund Article IV Policy Advice, 2001–03 Policy Advice Status • Broaden the tax base via a value-added tax (VAT), and reduce income tax rates. • New income tax law reduces top marginal rate; VAT under active consideration. • Reduce interest rates and introduce some flexibility. • Interest rates cut by 1–3 percentage points, and margins introduced. • Develop a treasury bills market. • No action to date. • Accelerate movement toward exchange rate unification. • Elimination of two exchange rates and the export surrender requirement. • Simplify the trade regime. • Recently negotiated EU trade agreement will, in time, reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers. • Avoid a piecemeal approach to reforms. • Comprehensive reform program outlined; not yet fully developed or implemented. • Improve the statistical database. • Fund statistical mission in June, World Bank Statistical Capacity Building grant underway.                                                     1 The agreement would provide for greater access to Syrian agricultural exports into the EU and a gradual dismantling of tariffs on manufactured imports into Syria over the next 12 years.  Signature and ratification is pending agreement on language regarding weapons programs. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 9 -     Figure 1.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS A.   Economic Developments in 2002–03 5. Real GDP growth is estimated to have slowed to about 2.5 percent in 2003, from 3.2 percent in 2002, as the negative impact of the war in Iraq and other regional developments offset strong agricultural production (Table 1). Agriculture growth was a mainstay of activity for the fourth consecutive year, along with construction and services. At the same time, CPI inflation picked up in 2003, and is expected to have exceeded 4 percent on average, based on data for the first 11 months of the year. After six years of  price decline or near-zero inflation, the increase in 2003 mainly was due to euro appreciation, along with increases in administered prices, shortages of agricultural goods during the Iraq war, and increasingly expansionary fiscal policy.2     6. The fiscal position is estimated to have deteriorated significantly in 2002 and 2003, following a record surplus in 2001. The authorities’ preliminary estimates suggest that the overall fiscal position (including the Price Stabilization Fund (PSF))3 shifted to a deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP in 2002 (Table 2). The sharp deterioration in 2002 is due to a reported drop in budgetary oil revenues, higher capital expenditure (reflecting a policy aimed at boosting activity through public investment), and higher personnel expenditure (following a 20 percent increase in civil servant wages in May 2002). The staff estimates that the deficit deteriorated further to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2003, due to continued expansionary spending policies and a decline in non-oil revenues, with the non-oil deficit widening further and total government debt rising to 31 percent of GDP at end-2003 (Figures 3–4).4 7. After three years of rapid increase driven by a large accumulation of net foreign assets (NFA), broad money growth decelerated during the first half of 2003 (Figure 5), due to lower export proceeds and private capital inflows (Table 3). High real interest rates through mid-2003 constrained credit growth (Box 1). The cumulative 1–3 percentage point decrease in interest rates in June and December significantly eased credit conditions.                                                   2 Official price developments may understate underlying inflationary pressures as prices for a portion of the basket, including basic foodstuffs and fuel, are controlled. 3 The PSF subsidies cover mainly wheat (flour) and other smaller subsidies for sugar and rice. Over 1998–2002, off-budget PSF deficits averaged 2 percent of GDP. 4Domestic debt is estimated at 12 percent of GDP, including net credit from the banking system and investment certificates (government bonds) held by the public. External debt is estimated at about 19 percent of GDP at end-2003.

The external position improved further in 2002, buoyed by strong oil and private sector exports (Table 4 and Figure 6). Oil export volumes were high, while non-oil exports picked up on account of new trade with Iraq,5 offsetting a deterioration in the services balance, reflecting a drop in tourism revenues, and lower investment income. However, based on available information, the external current account surplus is estimated to have narrowed in 2003 to 5 percent of GDP due to large drops in oil export volumes and non-oil exports, reflecting the disruption in trade with Iraq. Nevertheless, official reserves reached $4.5 billion at end-June 2003 (9 months of imports). Information provided by the authorities indicates that public external debt remained below 20 percent of GDP as of end-2003, which staff considers sustainable in light of Syria's sizable reserves, exports prospects, prudent borrowing policy, and low exposure to interest and exchange rate fluctuations.6  9. The nominal exchange rate on the parallel market remained stable overall in 2002–03 vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, despite temporary spikes due to the war in Iraq (Figure 7).7 The parallel market, which represents about 40 percent of current transactions, is supplied mainly by unrecorded remittances and exports (partly recorded in errors and omissions), and finances most private sector imports (Figure 10 and Table 5). The real effective exchange rate, relatively stable in recent years, depreciated significantly since end-2002, in line with inflation differentials with trade partner countries and the depreciation of the dollar against the euro. The premiums of the active official rates over the parallel market rate have remained below 15 percent since 1998, and narrowed significantly to under 10 percent in early 2004, suggesting no major misalignment.                                                  5 Reports suggesting that significant amounts of crude oil were imported from Iraq between late 2000-early 2003 were rejected by the authorities. Official data show that Syrian oil production and export volumes temporarily increased in 2001–2002 by about 60,000 b/d, and subsequently dropped back again to previous levels in 2003. The oil production data are not consistent with national accounts statistics. 6 External debt excludes debt to the Russian Federation and amounts arising from bilateral payments agreements that are still under discussion. Staff's analysis of debt sustainability is hampered by lack of those data as well as details on external debt. 7 The Central Bank of Syria (CBS) intervenes when necessary in the parallel market; in 2003, this included times of regional uncertainty such as the beginning of the war in Iraq.

Syria: Recent Monetary and Credit Developments and Outlook  Rapid broad money growth, high real interest rates, and sluggish net domestic credit growth persisted from 2000 through 2002, accompanied by low inflation or deflation and moderate economic growth.  Driven by an oil-revenue-related buildup of net foreign assets, broad money averaged annual growth of 20 percent during this period. However, while net credit to the government also increased, the strong monetary expansion did not translate into a significant increase in domestic credit to public enterprises or the private sector as high real interest rates (ranging up to about 12 percent) discouraged borrowing. Private investment also slowed and real GDP growth remained moderate.    In a banking system geared to meeting the credit needs of the public sector, until recently monetary policy was passive with nominal interest rates administratively set and unchanged since 1981. Real interest rates were affected by changes in inflation and, during 2000–02, declining or low inflation rates led to large increases in real interest rates. At the same time, the high real interest rates stoked demand for deposits, indicating that the increase in the money supply was met by a shift in money demand.   In 2003, money growth decelerated with lower accumulation of net foreign assets. At the same time, a more active monetary policy was introduced with the start of operations by the Money and Credit Board in early 2003. Nominal interest rates were reduced in June and December 2003, potentially leading to a pick up in domestic credit. However, still abundant liquidity raises concerns regarding a possible monetary overhang, with destabilizing consequences if money demand drops following the interest rate reductions.1  There is a risk the current, more relaxed monetary conditions could lead to a too rapid increase in domestic credit, triggering inflationary and exchange rate pressures. To forestall this possibility, new monetary policy instruments, such as treasury bills, should be introduced to control liquidity. Completing the establishment of modern banking supervision and prudential regulations is also crucial to avoid excessive risk-taking and the potential buildup of financial fragility in the banking sector.    -50510152025303540199519961997199819992000200120022003Broad money (M2) growthNet foreign assets growthCPI inflationReal GDP growth-10-5051019951997199920012003Net domestic credit growthPrivate sector credit growthReal interest rate 1 The staff previously estimated the monetary overhang at about 10-12 percent of broad money in 2000-01 (SM/03/32 and SM/03/59).

In November 2003, an updated draft economic reform program covering 2004–10, aimed at modernizing the economy and encouraging private activity while maintaining an important role for the state, was released for public discussion. Based on a frank and accurate discussion of weaknesses in the Syrian economy, the revised program calls for developing the use of market mechanisms instead of central planning and sets a goal of 6 percent real growth by 2010. The reform agenda appropriately identifies the need for: (i) increasing non-oil revenue through tax reform; (ii) reforming the banking sector and the monetary policy framework; (iii) unifying the exchange rate; (iv) liberalizing the trade regime; (v) improving public administration; and (vi) reforming public enterprises (although not through privatization). The reform program contains an annual timetable, although few details on specific measures or steps. The authorities have sought assistance from the Fund and other donors, particularly the EU, in carrying out reforms. 11. In line with their program, the authorities introduced reforms in the second half of 2003 that represent a break from past policies and should encourage private activity and economic growth (Annex I). In the financial sector, measures included: (i) authorizing the opening of three private banks (the first since the banking sector was nationalized 40 years ago), two of which began operations in January 2004;8 (ii) reducing interest rates in June and December 2003—the first changes in 22 years—by a cumulative 1–3 percentage points,9 introducing some flexibility for banks in setting rates (by one percentage point), and reducing lending fees and commissions; (iii) abolishing a 17-year old ban on foreign currency transactions;10 (iv) eliminating the export surrender requirement; (v) eliminating the export proceeds market (and the associated exchange rate); and (vi) passing anti-money laundering legislation. In the fiscal area, a new income tax law reducing the top marginal rate on profits from 60 to 35 percent was introduced along with a law reforming tax administration; domestic diesel prices were increased by 17 percent to a level about three-quarters of the world market price; and the prices of subsidized bread, sugar, and rice were increased by 10–20 percent. 12. In January 2004, the authorities further reduced the number of official exchange rates to three, from five a year ago, and narrowed the spread with the parallel market                                                  8 The new banks are 49 percent foreign-owned, with interests from Lebanon, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. They are authorized to conduct foreign currency transactions under the same conditions as the state-owned Commercial Bank of Syria (CoBS). 9 After the change, nominal deposit rates ranged from 2–5 percent (demand and savings deposits), and lending rates from 6–9.5 percent. 10 Holding and conducting transactions in foreign currency were crimes punishable by jail, following trial by special economic courts. Under the new regime, foreign exchange transactions remain subject to extensive regulations, but fall under ordinary law.

Some flexibility was introduced with the state-owned CoBS expected to vary the private sector rate in line with movements in the parallel market. III.   OUTLOOK AND RISKS  13. Based on current policies and trends, the outlook for 2004 and the medium term is mixed: growth is expected to accelerate moderately while the fiscal and external accounts are likely to deteriorate further (Table 6 and Figure 8). The baseline scenario assumes continued piecemeal implementation of structural reforms over the period through 2008. With a positive response from the private sector to reforms already implemented or ongoing, including lower interest rates and greater access to credit, non-oil GDP growth could rise to about 5 percent over 2005–08. However, in the absence of new policy measures and given projected decreases in oil prices, projections for 2004 and the medium term suggest a gradual deterioration in both the fiscal and external positions. Budget expenditure is expected to remain high even as some non-oil revenues are expected to decline from tariff reductions and the income tax reform (Box 2). The external current account surplus is expected to weaken, as the increase in exports is offset by increased imports reflecting higher demand and import prices. Reserves should remain at comfortable levels, although import cover will taper off as oil export receipts—the primary source of reserve accumulation—decline over the medium term. Finally, the projected modest pick-up in growth is unlikely to reduce significantly the high unemployment rate in light of continued high population growth.13        Foreign Reserves:  Sources (in $ billions) -1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.519971998199920002001200220032004Avg 05-08CapitalInvisiblesTradeForeign reservesOil Trade0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.019971998199920002001200220032004Avg 05-08-551525354555Oil exports, $ billions, LHSOil exports ('0,000 bpd) RHSOil price ($/b) RHS                                                  11 Syria continues to avail itself of the transitional provisions of Article XIV as it maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions; it also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII (see Appendix I). 12 No transactions take place at the official rate, which is retained for the purpose of future settlements of debt accumulated under bilateral payment agreements, mainly with Russia. 13 Annual population growth is estimated at 2.7 percent.

Syria: Characteristics of the Revenue Structure  Absent policy changes, the current revenue structure raises concerns for the longer-term outlook, particularly given recent increases in expenditure. Reliance on oil revenue rose sharply in recent years, reflecting steady increases in oil production until the mid-1990s, and high oil prices since 2000. At the same time, the outlook for oil prices is unpredictable and known oil reserves are limited; based on current projections, oil revenue will fall by 3 percentage points of GDP over the medium term and come to an end over the longer term, pointing to the likely need for substantial adjustment.   Under current policies, non-oil revenue is not expected to improve sufficiently to offset the loss in oil proceeds. Non-oil tax revenue, for example, will be affected by trade liberalization initiatives taken through recent trade agreements, while the new income tax law promulgated in November 2003 is not expected to lift tax receipts significantly. The new law will apply to income earned in 2004, and its revenue impact will be felt mostly in 2005 given the one-year lag for payment (except for salaries). Although the top marginal rate for profits was reduced and income brackets widened, exemptions were not eliminated and the tax base was not increased significantly. Consequently, the immediate revenue impact of the reform is expected to be negative. However, the authorities believe that the lower rates and application of a new tax evasion law will contribute to better compliance over time.  Text Table 2.

The economy is highly vulnerable to shocks over the medium term, and its resilience will depend on the strength of implementation of the authorities’ reform program. On the upside, private activity could respond more positively than expected to current reforms, while the sizable foreign exchange reserves built up in the past three years provide a comfortable cushion. Under a medium-term scenario that assumes full and rapid implementation of the authorities’ reform program, including exchange rate unification and full convertibility, trade liberalization, fiscal consolidation, and financial sector reforms, growth and fiscal prospects and official reserves would improve (Table 7 and Figure 8).14 However, significant vulnerabilities remain, particularly those related to changes in the regional environment, the impact of weather on agricultural production, and developments in world oil markets. Regarding the latter, the economy’s current reliance on oil revenue results in a high sensitivity to changes in world oil prices, as shown in the analysis measuring the impact on the fiscal and external accounts of a lower oil price (Figure 9). In addition, the expected continued mix of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies may increase pressure on prices and the exchange rate. IV.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS 15. Discussions focused on macroeconomic policies and reform priorities that, in the short and medium term, would improve growth prospects and reduce vulnerabilities while maintaining price stability. The staff and the authorities were in broad agreement on the key challenges, including those described in the staff’s assessment of the medium-term outlook, and the direction of policies needed to address them. As set out in the government’s draft economic reform program, the challenges include the need to sharply reduce reliance on oil, promote private activity, and bring down the high unemployment rate. On policies, the staff welcomed the authorities’ updated reform agenda, which includes many of the recommendations made during previous consultations, but observed that achieving the objective of higher growth would require a more broad-based and accelerated implementation of the identified reforms.   16. Drawing on the experience of countries that have moved to a market-based economy, the staff highlighted guidelines that could enhance progress in implementing reforms. While the current strong foreign reserve position, low inflation, and stable exchange rate provided a stable environment for undertaking reforms, maintaining macroeconomic stability will require pursuing appropriate fiscal, monetary, and structural policies within a coordinated framework. In addition, given implementation capacity constraints, a priority would also be to rapidly create a trained and flexible civil service to carry out reforms. Finally, experience shows that developing a strong institutional structure,                                                  14 This scenario assumes that a VAT would be introduced in 2006 along with gradual cuts in current and capital expenditure following a restructuring of government subsidies and public enterprises. With greater private sector response to reforms, domestic private investment, exports, and foreign direct investment would be higher, although stronger growth would also lead to higher imports.

The authorities generally agreed with the findings and recommendations of the staff. They indicated an interest in focusing on specific steps needed to move the reform process forward. During the discussions, areas were identified where the Fund could provide technical advice to assist in the design and implementation of the reform program, particularly in the areas of tax policy, budget management reform, banking supervision, financial programming, and economic data. A.   Macroeconomic Policy Issues 18. In light of the vulnerabilities for the fiscal and external accounts, the staff recommended corrective measures be introduced now to prevent a further weakening in macroeconomic balances. The continuation of expansionary fiscal policies posed risks for the short and medium term. At the same time, while the relaxation of tight credit conditions was welcome, there was potential for a too rapid increase in credit (Box 1). In this environment, and in light of the recent (although small) increase in prices, the staff underlined the need to monitor closely the possible emergence of inflationary and exchange rate pressures, particularly as the reform process moved forward. Fiscal policy 19. The staff observed that the current expansionary fiscal stance could lead to excessive demand pressures and a rapid accumulation of government debt, raising medium-term sustainability issues. The magnitude of fiscal expansion in the wake of the surge in oil-related revenue has been large, with total expenditure increasing by 9 percent of non-oil GDP from 1999–2002. This trend is estimated to have continued in 2003 and is budgeted for 2004, contributing to a potentially rapid deterioration in the fiscal position. While a projected overall fiscal deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP in 2004 may be manageable in the short term, continuing deficits of this magnitude or larger risk creating renewed inflationary pressures in the absence of alternatives to central bank financing. In addition, there may be significant quasi-fiscal deficits resulting from implicit exchange rate and interest subsidies provided by the banking sector (see paragraph 23).15                                                  15 Inadequate fiscal data hamper taking proper stock of the overall public sector position, including possible quasi-fiscal activities involving public enterprises.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 19 -       20. A longer-term concern is the budget’s heavy reliance on oil revenues, which accounted for about 50 percent of total revenue in 2000–02 (Box 2). In addition to being subject to the volatility of international oil prices, budgetary oil revenue is expected to recede in the longer term, absent new oil field discoveries and given the projected decline in oil prices. At the same time, under current policies, non-oil tax revenue will be affected negatively by trade liberalization. The new income tax law, while making the tax system more investment-friendly, is likely to lead to revenue losses initially, and effective implementation will require strengthening tax administration.  21. The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment of the need to maintain a sustainable fiscal framework over the medium term. In their view, however, the arguments were strong for continuing to rely on public sector investment in the near term to promote economic growth, while in parallel introducing new revenue sources and measures to promote private activity that would have an impact over the medium term. While recognizing merits in this argument, the staff continued to recommend a more cautious fiscal policy stance, particularly as heavy reliance on public investment had not promoted rapid economic growth to date.  22. On the revenue side, the staff commended the authorities’ efforts to reform and improve the tax system, and encouraged them in their plan to introduce a VAT. Noting that the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax to replace the existing collection of ad hoc taxes would be an efficient way of generating higher and more stable non-oil revenue, the staff supported the authorities’ proposal to rapidly introduce a VAT. While commending the positive progress made in income tax reform, including by sharply reducing the top marginal tax rate, the staff recommended that the authorities complete the reform effort by reducing Proj AverageAverageAverageAverage 1990-941995-992000-0320042005-08   Revenue, o/w: 24.125.729.428.7 25.4 Oil-related proceeds 10.310.515.013.9 10.7  Expenditure 27.625.529.032.3 31.6 Current expenditure 18.313.817.119.2 18.5 Development expenditure 9.311.711.913.1 13.1   Overall balance (incl.

In light of the urgent need to introduce new revenue, the staff welcomed the authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance on tax policy and administration, and a mission on these issues is expected to be fielded in the next few months.  23. On the expenditure side, the staff noted that reductions will be needed over the medium term in light of diminishing oil revenue, which would require rationalizing and prioritizing public expenditure, including subsidies. As a first step, budget transparency should be improved, in particular by clearly identifying all explicit subsidies and incorporating all implicit subsidies in the budget. The staff observed that the subsidies on domestic petroleum product prices and food, estimated at about 1.4 percent and 3 percent of GDP, respectively, were not explicitly identified in the budget. In addition, other implicit subsidies were absorbed by the central bank, including exchange rate subsidies provided to the public sector as a result of the multiple exchange rate regime, estimated at about 1 percent of GDP in 2003,16 and subsidized interest rates benefiting agricultural production. The staff advocated a gradual reduction of subsidies in parallel with providing support targeted for the needy. Monetary and exchange rate policies 24. The relaxation of credit conditions achieved by the reduction in interest rates in 2003, after several years of high real interest rates, should have a positive impact on private sector credit, investment, and growth (Box 1). However, against the background of high liquidity, continuing expansionary fiscal policy, and the recent increase in inflation (although still low), the staff urged the authorities to monitor monetary and exchange rate developments for signs of inflationary pressures. The authorities confirmed that containing inflation was a priority goal and affirmed their ongoing commitment to monitor developments closely and take appropriate measures as needed. While welcoming the more active approach to monetary policy—including the operations of the new Money and Credit Board which now carries out monetary policy—the staff urged that these be complemented by structural measures (discussed below), such as the development of indirect monetary policy instruments. 25. The staff urged the authorities to rapidly unify the multiple exchange rates. While the pegged exchange rate regime seems appropriate in light of Syria’s current economic and structural conditions, over time, as reforms progress, the exchange rate policy should be kept under review. In addition, the peg should be supported by prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Based on the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate, the absence                                                  16 This subsidy is estimated to decline by half in 2004 as a result of the devaluation of the public sector rate. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 21 -     of significant pressure on the parallel exchange rate, good non-oil export performance, and generally low labor costs, competitiveness seems to have improved in the last two years.17   26. The staff strongly supported plans to develop additional monetary policy instruments for the central bank’s use—in particular the introduction of treasury bills. As the financial sector develops, indirect instruments will be needed to control money and credit supply, and a treasury bill market could serve this purpose in addition to meeting the financing needs of the government. Introducing indirect instruments would allow phasing out administered interest rates and credit allocation.  27. The staff welcomed the authorities’ goal of liberalizing interest rates, and recommended that immediate steps be taken to simplify and make more flexible the rate structure. The interest rate structure is highly complex and provides implicit subsidies for specific sectors (particularly agriculture) and for public enterprises. These subsidies should be reviewed and, if necessary, replaced by direct budgetary transfers. Central bank interest rates should be unified across banks, and banks given the freedom to set interest rates in line with market developments. B.   Structural Policies 28. Given the authorities’ intention to maintain an important role for the state while at the same time encouraging private sector growth, the staff recommended measures that should promote private activity. These include the need to identify clearly the areas open to private activity; to publicize, simplify, and clarify government policies and regulations; to establish market-based rules applicable equally to both public and private enterprises; and to ensure the development and existence of strong institutions. Price distortions 29. Experience indicates that a priority reform in moving toward a market-oriented economy is to allow price signals to work by phasing out administered prices and replacing them as needed with explicit budgetary transfers. The staff welcomed the removal of the last remaining price guidelines for private sector goods and services. However, the production of key crops continues to be promoted by support prices above international prices, and electricity and water prices (in addition to some petroleum prices) are heavily subsidized. As noted above, the staff recommended the gradual elimination of these subsidies, possibly beginning with the smallest, and replacing them with explicit budget transfers targeted to protecting the poor. Other administered prices remain numerous, particularly in the public enterprise sector, and should also be liberalized gradually.                                                  17 Public and private sector wages in Syria are, for example, significantly lower than in neighboring Lebanon and Jordan. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 22 -     Trade and exchange rate regimes 30. Recent progress on regional and bilateral trade agreements should encourage non-oil exports and serve as a catalyst for private development; staff recommended building on these steps with an acceleration of tariff reform.18 In addition to the prospective Association Agreement with the EU, tariffs on trade with Arab countries are expected to be removed under the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) by 2005.19 The projected tariff reductions from both agreements should reduce the average effective tariff rate significantly and boost non-oil exports.20 As high tariffs and a complex tariff system are barriers to private investment and growth and foster corruption, the staff recommended accelerating reforms now by adopting a reduced tariff structure for all trading partners, simplifying the tariff structure by collapsing the current 19 rates into 4–5 rates, and eliminating exemptions.  31. The staff encouraged the authorities to move quickly to their goal of a fully unified exchange rate, and encouraged them to identify specific steps within a compressed timeframe. A possible early step would be to move the public sector transaction rate (now about 9 percent appreciated compared to the parallel market rate) toward the private sector rate, taking due account of the budgetary consequences. Convertibility of the Syrian pound, private sector access to the public sector foreign exchange pool, and termination of continuing restrictions on foreign exchange transactions would also be needed to unify the segmented foreign exchange market and eliminate the parallel market. 32. The authorities are considering achieving current account convertibility and Article VIII status. The staff strongly encouraged the authorities to follow through with the intention to remove payment and exchange restrictions in the near future. This step would send a major signal regarding the authorities’ reform intentions, increase private sector access to imports and foreign exchange, and bring foreign exchange from unrecorded remittances into the official system. Financial sector  33. The opening of two private banks is a key development for the financial sector; at the same time, public banks are in need of reform. 21 The staff noted that it will be                                                  18 Syria has one of the most restrictive trade regimes in the MENA region, as measured by the Fund’s trade restrictiveness index. 19 EU and GAFTA member countries count for about 40 percent of merchandise imports. 20 The average effective tariff rate is only 12 percent, despite individual rates ranging as high as 255 percent. 21 There are six public banks, of which five are specialized by sector. The largest, the CoBS, has a monopoly over foreign exchange transactions—although the new private banks have also been authorized to deal in foreign currency. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 23 -     necessary to level the playing field between private and public banks, as in time the two will be in competition.22 In particular, public banks’ sectoral specialization and other operational restrictions should be lifted, while subjecting them to hard budget constraints. A more comprehensive restructuring of public banks may be necessary, possibly involving splitting and mergers. The authorities were in agreement with this assessment and noted that they were now considering a wide range of scenarios, consistent with the issues raised by the staff, for reforming the public banking sector. 34. The authorities reported that the public banking sector was profitable and the level of non-performing loans low; however, limited and delayed data availability prevents an overall assessment of the banking sector’s health. The banks’ consolidated balance sheet suggests that profitability may have been eroded by the high interest paid on growing bank deposits in the past few years, without a parallel increase in credit. The staff strongly recommended that compilation and monitoring of financial soundness indicators begin for all banks. These would also be required to formulate a plan to reform public banks.  35. The staff emphasized the need to speed up implementation of a comprehensive banking sector regulatory framework and application of international supervision and accounting standards. The authorities were in agreement that high priority should be assigned to completing this task. The preparatory technical work is largely completed, with assistance from Fund long-term experts. The prudential and reporting regulations should be issued promptly, including those regarding capital adequacy requirements, loan classification and provisioning, and exposure to risk. The staff also welcomed the passage of an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) law in September 2003 and the authorities’ intention to implement it promptly, including the establishment of the financial information unit and the adoption of all necessary regulations.   36. While the staff welcomed the interest in establishing a stock exchange, it saw the establishment of a strong banking sector as a reform of higher priority.  However, should the authorities move forward on the creation of a stock market, a strong and transparent legal and governance framework would need to be established, including rules for clearing and settlement procedures and public disclosure.   Fiscal management and other reforms 37. As the authorities agreed, fiscal management needs to be substantially improved in many areas, including budget classification, reporting systems, and timeliness of information. Currently, budget execution and reporting is fragmented among different agencies within and outside the finance ministry; PSF operations and financing remain partially outside the budget; budget classification does not conform to international standards; fiscal data are only available with long lags and cannot be reconciled with monetary and financing data; comprehensive debt data are not available; and overall fiscal transparency is                                                  22 Initially, the new private banks are likely to focus on trade finance and consumer lending. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 24 -     limited. Consequently, the staff welcomed the authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance in budget management, expected to take place this summer.  38. Plans to reform public enterprises, as described in the authorities’ reform agenda, should be broadened to include the introduction of hard budget constraints. The complex system of budget transfers and public sector bank credits make it difficult to assess the health of public enterprises and the possible existence of underlying losses. The staff recommended that budget constraints be gradually introduced for public enterprises, including public banks, and that subsidies be explicitly entered in the government’s budget (as mentioned above). Where the private sector is active alongside public enterprises, both should be subject to the same rules for commercial activity.   39. The staff recommended establishment of a social safety net that could provide interim protection for workers through the creation of an unemployment fund. Labor market rigidities could then be relaxed, particularly legal restrictions on hiring and firing. The stimulus to private sector activity could, over time, create new jobs to absorb the unemployed.   C.   Statistical Issues 40. Poor data quality and provision continues to make in-depth economic analysis and surveillance difficult. The staff stressed that the periodicity, coverage, timeliness, and consistency of economic data across all sectors (including, in particular, the fiscal and financial sectors, and the national accounts) needed significant improvement to allow adequate monitoring of economic developments and to strengthen policy formulation. The weak statistical base appears to be mainly due to severe capacity limitations, as recognized by the authorities (Appendix III). At their request, a Fund statistical assessment mission will take place in June, and a Statistical Capacity Building grant is under consideration by the World Bank. The staff also encouraged participation in the GDDS, and requested more regular provision of core economic indicators to the Fund. V.   STAFF APPRAISAL 41. The macroeconomic situation is stable, largely supported by strong oil receipts; however, economic growth is moderate and unemployment remains a problem. While growth is expected to accelerate somewhat in 2004, reflecting recent progress on reforms, more assertive action on structural reforms and macroeconomic policy measures are needed to reduce dependency on depleting oil supplies, prevent a weakening of macroeconomic balances, encourage private investment and activity, and raise economic growth to levels that would reduce high unemployment rates.   42. The authorities’ economic reform program calls for moving toward greater use of market mechanisms instead of central planning, while maintaining a significant role for the state. The staff broadly agrees with the direction of the proposed policies in the authorities’ program, but calls for accelerated and broad implementation. This would provide a clear and strong signal that the authorities are committed to moving toward a market-based Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 25 -     economy and a larger role for private activity. However, faster implementation of reforms may be held back by the challenges facing Syria, including social and political constraints and limited technical capacity.  43. Against this background, the staff welcomes the authorities’ interest in establishing closer ties with the Fund and other institutions to provide assistance in carrying out their reform program. In response, Fund technical assistance is planned in areas critical to progress on reforms, including on tax policy, budget management, statistics, and training, along with continuing support on banking supervision.  44. The staff commends the authorities for the significant economic reforms introduced in 2003, which should improve the environment for private activity. Most notably, steps were taken toward simplifying the exchange rate system and allowing for some interest rate flexibility; a new income tax law with sharply reduced marginal rates was introduced; and private banks began operations in January 2004. In addition, negotiations with the EU on a trade association agreement were concluded at the technical level.   45. While non-oil GDP growth is projected to increase to about 5 percent over the medium term due to a private sector response to reforms already underway, current trends point to increasing fiscal and external imbalances. In particular, the projected decline in world oil prices could lead to a gradual deterioration in both the fiscal and external positions, and the mix of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies may increase pressure on prices and the exchange rate. Implicit exchange rate and interest rate subsidies suggest the presence of quasi-fiscal deficits and the potential for weaknesses in the public enterprise sector. The budget’s reliance on oil revenues results in a high sensitivity to oil price shocks even as non-oil revenues are expected to decline, and known oil reserves are limited. 46. To prevent a further weakening of the fiscal and external positions, fiscal policy should be tightened now. The staff welcomes the authorities’ plans to raise non-oil revenues by introducing a VAT, and urges them to also reduce exemptions in the income tax law. On the expenditure side, the need to reduce spending over time will require rationalizing and prioritizing expenditure, including the numerous subsidies. A first step would be to improve budget transparency by clearly identifying and incorporating in the budget all explicit and implicit subsidies.  47. While the staff welcomes the easing in monetary policy, which comes after several years of high real interest rates, it cautions the authorities to take appropriate measures should signs of inflationary pressures emerge. Monetary and fiscal policies need to be supportive of the authorities’ choice of a pegged exchange rate during the reform process, which the staff supports, provided it is kept under review as reforms progress.  48. To progress toward a market economy, price distortions should be tackled as a priority. This will involve replacing price controls and administered prices with explicit budgetary transfers, and gradually removing interest rate subsidies. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 26 -     49. The staff supports the goal of unifying the exchange rate, but encourages an acceleration of the timetable and full current account convertibility of the Syrian pound as soon as possible. While trade should be boosted by the prospective agreement with the EU and the GAFTA framework, more should be done to lift trade barriers by simplifying the tariff structure, extending tariff reductions to all trading partners, and eliminating exemptions. 50. Developing additional monetary policy instruments is of critical importance, and the staff supports the plan to introduce negotiable treasury bills. Interest rates should be liberalized, and interest rate subsidies, if needed, should be replaced by budgetary transfers. Public banks will require comprehensive restructuring. 51. The completion of a regulatory and supervisory framework for the banking sector is a priority, along with compilation and monitoring of financial soundness indicators. Setting up a stock exchange is a second phase priority. The staff welcomes the passage of an AML law and the authorities’ intention to implement it promptly. 52. Fiscal management and reporting need substantial improvements. The staff welcomes the authorities’ request for technical assistance in this area. Hard budget constraints will need to be introduced for public enterprises, and labor market rigidities, including the ability to hire and fire, should be relaxed. A social safety net should be provided through the creation of an unemployment fund. 53. The quality and timeliness of economic and financial data should be improved significantly to allow adequate monitoring of economic developments and policy formulation. The staff welcomes the authorities’ request for technical assistance in this area, and encourages participation in the GDDS and regular provision of core data to the Fund. 54. Syria continues to maintain, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, including administrative allocation of foreign exchange. The staff urges the authorities to eliminate these restrictions as soon as its balance of payments permits. Syria also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. The staff welcomes the authorities’ consideration of achieving current account convertibility and of accepting the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4. However, in the absence of specific measures to eliminate the restrictions and multiple currency practices in a timely manner, the staff does not recommend that the Executive Board grant approval for the retention of these restrictions and multiple currency practices. The staff urges the authorities to eliminate these restrictions without delay. 55. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12–month cycle.

The Fund takes this decision relating to the Syrian Arab Republic’s exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, and in concluding the 2004 Article XIV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic, in the light of the 2004 Article IV consultations with the Syrian Arab Republic conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63) adopted on April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in [SM/04/...], the Syrian Arab Republic maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2.  In addition, as described in [SM/04/...], the Syrian Arab Republic maintains measures subject to approval under Article VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:  The exchange system in Syria is characterized by multiple exchange rates and a foreign exchange market segmented into public and private sector pools. Public and private sectors conduct their respective transactions with foreign exchange sourced from two separate pools. The private sector has almost no access to the official pool, sourced by public sector foreign exchange revenues channeled through the Commercial Bank of Syria, and conducts its transactions on an unofficial parallel market located in Syria and offshore, sourced by foreign exchange from tourism receipts, workers’ remittances, proceeds from unrecorded exports, and private capital inflows. Under the multiple rate structure, there are three official rates pegged to the dollar and one unofficial rate determined by supply and demand conditions.                                                  23Under the Eleventh General Review.

Article IV Consultations:  Syria is on the annual consultation cycle. The last consultation was held in October 2002 and was completed on February 24, 2003.  IX. Article XIV Consultations:  Syria continues to maintain, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, including administrative allocation of foreign exchange. Syria also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII: (i) prohibition against purchases by private parties of foreign exchange from the banking system for most current international transactions; (ii) a multiple currency practice resulting from divergences of more than 2 percent between the official exchange rate and officially recognized exchange rates; (iii) a non-interest bearing advance import deposit requirement of 75–100 percent for public sector imports as well as private sector imports which are not financed from abroad; and (iv) an exchange restriction arising from the net debt under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with the Russian Federation and Sri Lanka.  The Executive Board adopted on a lapse-of-time basis the following decision on December 24, 2003 (EBD/03/117):  1. The Fund takes this decision in concluding the 2003 Article XIV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic.  2. The Syrian Arab Republic continues to maintain restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2 as described in SM/03/32. In addition, the Syrian Arab Republic maintains measures subject to approval under Article VIII as described in SM/03/32. The Fund encourages the Syrian Arab Republic to eliminate the restrictions that are subject to approval under Article VIII as soon as possible.  IX.

Consequently, the country’s eligibility for disbursements was reinstated as of July 1, 2002. Subsequent to the agreement on arrears in July 1997, the World Bank began to provide non-lending services to Syria. Initial activities included support for the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Syria in accounting and the establishment of an external debt management system in the form of grants from the Institutional Development Fund; planning and implementation grants supporting Year 2000 remediation efforts; the Global Environment Fund biodiversity project; and reviews of the trade regime (including export promotion), health, roads, urban water and sanitation, and agricultural irrigation sectors. At the same time, the IFC began to identify possible private sector projects for support through IFC equity investments or loans without government guarantee. In December 1999, the IFC approved its first project in Syria, making a $1 million equity investment in an irrigation technology company that designs and manufactures systems that address the critical problem of water scarcity in the Middle East. Since 1999, IFC has made three investments in Syria totaling $17.2 million. The first is an investment in Arab Drip Irrigation Technology Company in Latakia. The company specializes in manufacturing drip irrigation equipment for the Syrian and export market, thereby reducing flood irrigation and promoting efficient water utilization strategies. The second is a project finance loan to Daaboul Company, an established manufacturer and exporter of detergents and cleaning products. IFC has also agreed to structure and to invest in a commercial bank with Blom Bank as its technical partner, and a group of Syrian businessmen. IFC has undertaken numerous technical assistance assignments and studies in Syria aimed at assisting the government in defining the role of the private sector in the economy, and providing IFC and other investors with sector assessments to facilitate their investments. The most recent study relates to the regulatory framework in the insurance sector and provides a draft insurance law. The full scope and nature of the Bank’s assistance program continues to be under discussion with the Syrian authorities. Although the Bank’s involvement in Syria is still limited, two main areas of focus are emerging: (i) analytical and technical assistance activities on trade, investment and economic development issues; (ii) pilot lending in the social sectors, possibly health and education. The Bank has finalized a report on trade policy options and a note on long-term economic development challenges, and will carry out an investment climate survey with the private sector. FIAS will provide assistance on the FDI environment. Finally, the Bank is discussing with the government a project to establish a national strategy for statistical capacity building.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  APPENDIX III  - 50 -Syrian Arab Republic: Statistical Issues  1. Significant weaknesses exist in Syria’s statistical base in terms of coverage, consistency, periodicity, and timeliness, which have hampered the staff’s ability to conduct economic analysis and effective surveillance. Efforts to address the weaknesses in the statistical base should cover a wide range of sectors, including national accounts, government finance, monetary, and balance of payments. 2. Statistical issues have been discussed with the Syrian representatives during Article IV consultations. They have acknowledged data deficiencies and indicated that efforts will be made to address them. Statistical issues in various sectors of the economy are discussed below. a. Real sector 3. The Central Bureau of Statistics has made steady progress in implementing the recommendations of the last (December 1995) national accounts statistics mission. However the following weaknesses still exist: • GDP estimates by the production approach suffer from under-coverage of activities, particularly in trade and private services. The base year has been updated to 2000.  • Syria has a multiple exchange rate system. This imposes implicit indirect taxes and subsidies that can affect GDP and other national accounts aggregates. Currently, no adjustments are made to these aggregates.  • The estimates of final expenditures on GDP are incomplete, as household final consumption expenditures are calculated as a residual and include changes in inventories (since the latter is not estimated separately). The authorities have begun to collect data on inventory changes in the public sector.  • Consumption of fixed capital is estimated as a constant ratio of output.  • Net income flows between residents and nonresidents derived from the balance of payments are unsatisfactory. As a result, the estimates of saving, investment, and net borrowing from abroad are unreliable.  • National accounts figures for 2001 show a surprising boom in investment, which increases by 25 percent in real terms, entirely due to a doubling in private investment in the agricultural sector. Such an increase remains puzzling.  • Consumer price index calculations are fairly unusual. Prices for each month are compared to the same month of the base year; and there are four weighing schemes, one Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  APPENDIX III  - 51 -for each quarter. Consequently, no month-on-month inflation can be derived, and the annual average inflation is not equal to the sum of the monthly indices.  • The wholesale price index is compiled and reported annually but is not representative, as most prices are those of public sector enterprises.  4. As of December 2003, the latest national accounts figures reported in the International Finance Statistics (IFS) were for 2000, although the Central Bureau of Statistics published preliminary 2002 accounts in its annual publication. b. Government finance 5. The staff does not receive any fiscal data from the authorities between consultations and has identified the following weaknesses in the fiscal accounts: • Final budget accounts are available with an almost 2-year lag. Staff received final 2001 accounts in November 2003, with a revision equivalent to about 3½ percent of GDP relative to preliminary estimates provided by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) a year earlier. • Financing abroad as reported in the budgetary accounts cannot be confirmed by the balance of payments accounts. The accounting system of the MoF does not permit an accurate breakdown between interest and principal payments on domestic and foreign debt, and debt servicing is reported on a cash rather than an accrual basis. Expenditure classified as interest payments by the MoF includes numerous other unrelated spending items. • There are large discrepancies between the fiscal deficit reported by the MoF and financing reported by the Central Bank of Syria (CBS). The discrepancy is estimated at 8 percent of GDP in 2001, and may be explained by misclassification of credit to public enterprises (including settlements of arrears) that were recorded as government transactions. • The CBS occasionally assumes the accumulated debt of public enterprises to the banking system through the issuance of government bonds; such operations are not reflected in the fiscal accounts. • Some tax revenue items should be reclassified as non-tax revenues. • Reconciliation of oil-related revenues in the budget and in the balance of payments is made difficult by uncertainties regarding the timing of the transfers of surpluses, royalties, and profit taxes from the Syrian Petroleum Company to the budget. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  APPENDIX III  - 52 -• Operations of the Price Stabilization Fund and the Public Debt Fund are not consolidated with budget accounts. 6. Syria reports annual fiscal data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, but the latest data reported are for 1999. Moreover, the reported data are partial, too aggregated, in part misclassified, and do not include extra-budgetary and social security accounts. No data on financing and debt are provided. c. Monetary accounts 7. Monetary statistics suffer from major deficiencies, which hamper the staff’s ability to conduct meaningful analysis of monetary developments. These deficiencies are discussed below. Valuation of net foreign assets in the monetary accounts • Foreign assets and liabilities held by the CBS are recorded in its balance sheet at an overvalued exchange rate. For instance, foreign liabilities appear to be valued at LS/$ 11.25 (the official but unused exchange rate) instead of LS/$ 46.5 (which is the official rate used for public sector transactions), with the adjustment to the latter rate recorded as a valuation adjustment (an unclassified asset). For the Commercial Bank of Syria, exchange rates used for the valuation of foreign assets and liabilities were adjusted in 2000 and 2001, but a large unclassified liability remains. Inconsistencies between monetary and balance of payments statistics • Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the banking system are much higher in the monetary survey (MS) than in the international liquidity table derived from the balance of payments. For instance, they amounted to $14.7 billion in the former, against $9.0 billion in the latter at end-2002. There was a similar discrepancy on 2002 flows, with NFA increasing by $1.8 billion according to MS compared to $1.1 billion in the international liquidity table. Inconsistencies between fiscal and monetary accounts • The balance sheet of the CBS shows continuously rising government deposits reaching LS 392 billion (close to 40 percent of GDP) at end-2002. Such a level seems very unlikely and the MoF has denied the existence of large deposits. Conversely, the balance sheet of the CBS shows similarly increasing claims on the government of LS 322 billion (32 percent of GDP) at end-2002. It is possible government withdrawals are accounted as credit and not netted out against deposits. • Profits advanced to the government have been increasing steadily over the past years to reach LS 54 billion in 2001 (6.7 percent of CBS’s total assets), as if profits transferred Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  APPENDIX III  - 53 -in the past were considered a permanent claim on the government. The counter entry for this discrepancy has been in the capital account on the liability side. • As mentioned earlier, government financing data provided by the CBS do not match the budgetary financing requirements reported by the MoF, with a discrepancy as high as 8 percent of GDP in 2001. 8. Monthly monetary data for the IFS are reported with a 5–8 month lag.  d. Balance of payments 9. The balance of payments (BOP) is presented in BPM5 format, but its compilation method is not entirely consistent with the BPM5 methodology. The January 1996 STA technical assistance mission found that BOP data suffered from incomplete coverage and valuation problems arising from the presence of multiple exchange rates. Several data issues have been addressed since then; however, the following weaknesses remain: • Private transfers do not fully reflect remittances by Syrians working abroad. The statistics in the BOP for official transfers differ significantly from figures provided from other sources, such as donors.  • Data on long-term official capital inflows and amortization are not consistent with the data provided by the MoF on the external financing of the budget deficit. Data on private capital movements are incomplete. • Data on external debt continue to be incomplete, and external debt service obligations and arrears are not recorded in the BOP. • Military imports are excluded from BOP and external debt data. • As mentioned above, there is a large discrepancy between reserve flows reported in the BOP and the reserve flows implied by the MS. 10. The BOP is compiled annually by the CBS on a provisional basis with about an eight-month lag. As of December 2003, the latest BOP figures reported in the IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook 2003 refer to 2000, although the CBS published 2002 data in its semi-annual publication. Trade data are compiled monthly by the Customs Department and reported quarterly by the Central Bureau of Statistics with a six-month lag.

The economy is characterized by external account surpluses and a comfortable international reserve position. Inflation, while beginning to rise, remains low. However, economic growth remains moderate, unemployment is high, the fiscal situation is deteriorating, and significant vulnerabilities cloud the outlook. The economy is heavily dependent on oil and agriculture and, therefore, vulnerable to unpredictable developments in the world oil market and in rainfall. Oil reserves are small and expected to be depleted within 10–15 years at current extraction rates, absent new discoveries. Notwithstanding the reform measures introduced gradually in the 1990s, the Syrian Arab Republic remains a government-controlled economy. Private activity, although vibrant in some sectors, has not been a major driver of economic growth. While economic growth has recovered from the poor performance of the late 1990s, it has not regained the high rates averaging 8 percent achieved in the first half of the decade.                                                   24 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [April, 28, 2004] Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

C. 20431 USA  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  ATTACHMENT I  - 57 -The macroeconomic situation weakened in 2003 in the aftermath of the Iraq war. Real GDP growth is estimated by staff to have slowed to under 3 percent in 2003, from 3.2 percent in 2002, as the negative impact of regional developments offset strong agricultural production. CPI inflation rose to over 4 percent. Due to a sharp increase in the wage bill and development expenditure, along with a drop in oil revenue, the fiscal position is estimated to have deteriorated significantly in 2002 and 2003, with the deficit reaching 1.6 percent and 3.5 percent of GDP, respectively, following a record surplus equivalent to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2001. After three years of rapid increase driven by a large accumulation of net foreign assets, broad money growth decelerated during the first half of 2003 on account of lower export proceeds and private capital inflows. Monetary policy was relaxed by reductions in administered interest rates in June and December 2003. The external position improved further in 2002, buoyed by strong oil and private sector exports. However, the external surplus narrowed to an estimated 5 percent of GDP in 2003 due to large drops in oil export volumes and non-oil exports reflecting the disruption in trade with Iraq. Official reserves reached a comfortable $4.5 billion (9 months of imports) at end-June 2003, and the exchange rate on the parallel market remained stable overall in 2002–03 vis-à-vis the dollar, despite temporary spikes due to regional developments.  In September 2003, a new cabinet was appointed, tasked with accelerating administrative and economic reforms while fighting corruption. Since then, the economic reform momentum has picked up, although significant challenges remain in moving away from central planning toward a market economy. In November, an updated draft economic reform program covering 2004–10 was released for public discussion, aimed at modernizing the economy and encouraging private activity while maintaining an important role for the state. The reform agenda appropriately identifies the need for (i) increasing non-oil revenue through tax reform; (ii) reforming the banking sector and the monetary policy framework; (iii) unifying the exchange rate; (iv) liberalizing the trade regime; (v) improving public administration; and (vi) reforming public enterprises (although not through privatization).  In line with their reform program, the authorities introduced economic reforms in the second half of 2003 that represent a break from past policies and should encourage private activity and economic growth. In the financial sector, measures included (i) authorizing the opening of three private banks—the first since the sector was nationalized 40 year ago—two of which began operations in January 2004; (ii) reducing interest rates—the first changes in 22 years—by a cumulative 1-3 percentage points, introducing some rate flexibility, and reducing lending fees; (iii) abolishing a 17-year old ban on foreign currency transactions; (iv) eliminating the export surrender requirement; (v) eliminating the export proceeds market and the associated exchange rate; and (vi) passing anti-money laundering legislation. In the fiscal area, a new income tax law reducing top marginal rates on profits was introduced; and prices of domestic diesel and subsidized bread, sugar, and rice were increased significantly. Negotiations on an association agreement with the European Union were concluded at the technical level. In January 2004, the authorities further reduced the number of official exchange rates to three, from five a year earlier, and narrowed the spread with the parallel market rate.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  ATTACHMENT I  - 58 -Based on current policies and trends, the outlook for 2004 and the medium term is mixed: growth is expected to accelerate moderately on account of a positive response from the private sector to ongoing reforms, while the fiscal and external accounts are likely to deteriorate slightly, mainly tracking projected declines in oil prices, given unchanged oil production. However, the projected modest pick-up in growth is unlikely to reduce significantly the high unemployment rate in light of continued high population growth. The economy will remain vulnerable to shocks over the medium term, and its resilience will depend on the strength of implementation of the authorities’ reform program. In addition, the expected continued mix of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies may increase pressure on prices and the exchange rate. Full implementation of the authorities’ reform program, including exchange rate unification and full convertibility, trade liberalization, fiscal consolidation, and financial sector reforms would improve growth and fiscal prospects and contain the decline in official reserves.
