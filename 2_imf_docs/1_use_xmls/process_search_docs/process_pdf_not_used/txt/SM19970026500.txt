Unsustainable fiscal deficits over the last decade led to a large accumulation of external arrears that cut access to foreign financing. With substantial public dissaving, public investment was curtailed and failed to keep up with the need for infrastructure. . Economic activity rebounded in 1996, foilowing severe hurricane damage in September 1995, but tourism has not fully recovered. Growth is slowing in 1997. . The “home-grown” adjustment program to address the fiscal imbalance that was developed in 1994-95 has since stalled, as the planned spending cuts were not implemented in 1996, and there have been no sign&ant revenue measures in 1997. Policy issues . The overriding policy issue continues to be the need to bolster public savings and normalie relations with external creditors. . The fiscal deficit, after contracting in 1996, is rising in 1997 with a sharp pickup in current and capital spending and is being fmanced partly by a further accumulation of arrears. The upswing in public investment coupled with declining public saving is not sustainable, however. A two-year government wage freeze is ending soon, and the authorities are relying on attrition to reduce overstaffing in the public sector. 0 Under the authorities’ approach to normaliing relations with external creditors, the restructuring of one large bilateral loan is under way and the Caribbean Development Bank resumed lending following clearance of all arrears to the bank earlier this year. Staff position . To improve growth prospects, a strong and comprehensive long-term adjustment program is needed. . Recommended revenue measures include the elimination of discretionary tax exemptions, increases in direct taxation, and improvements in tax administration 0 To restore external creditworthiness, a multilateral approach to dealing with the arrears problem would be preferable to the government’s bilateral strategy. . Governance issues that merit attention include the need to curb discretionary tax exemptions and to achieve greater transparency and accountability in budgetary procedures.

The 1997 Article IV consultation discussions with Antigua and Barbuda were held in St. John’s during the period August 26-September 12. Meetings were held with the Prime Minister; the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture; Tourism, Culture and Environment; Public Utilities, Public Works, and Energy; and Health and Civil Service maim; other senior govem- ment officials; and private sector representatives.’ Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.’ There are no outstanding obligations to the Fund. 2. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation, on July 23, 1996, Directors expressed concern about the limited progress made in addressing the country’s serious fiscal imbalance and normalizing relations with external creditors. Directors urged the authorities to strengthen the adjustment effort and noted that the adoption of a “home-grown” adjustment program, while welcome, did not go far enough. They stressed the urgent need to bolster tax revenues, to reform the civil service, and to improve expenditure monitoring. 3. The quality, coverage, and timeliness of key economic statistics fall well short of what is required for economic analysis and surveillance in many areas, in particular the fiscal, balance of payments, and labor market data. The main problems are discussed in Appendix II. II. BACKGROUND A. Economic Setting 4. Antigua and Barbuda’s small island economy depends mostly on tourism, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings and contributes, directly and indirectly, more than half of GDP.” Unsustainable fiscal deficits over the last ‘The s&&team comprised Messrs. Lewis (Head), Canales-Rriljenko, and Tanner, Ms. Rrieger, and Mrs. Aquino (Assistant) (all WHD). Mr. van Beek (WHD) and Mr. Chelsky (Assistant to the Executive Director) participated in the final round of discussions. The mission was assisted by Mrs. Ferracho-Williams and Mrs. Williams of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and Mr. Murphy of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). ‘Relations with the Fund are summarized in Appendix 1, 3A World Bank estimate of 60 percent in 1992 is the latest available; the hotel and restaurant sector accounts for 14 percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- decade, stemming from large, and often uneconomic, public investment projects and diffi- culties in mobilizing revenue led to an accumulation of external payment arrears that now amount to some US400 million, or 70 percent of GDP (Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2). 5. By the beginning of the 199Os, foreign financing had all but dried up and, with substantial public d&wings for a number of years, public investment failed to keep up with the need for maintenance and expansion of social and economic intiastructure. Also, the consolidated fiscal accounts masked the t?nther imbalance arising from the government’s nonpayment of contributions for social security and medical benefits.’ 6. The weak public finances resulted in part from a lack of tax buoyancy and from the public sector’s role as a provider ofjobs; as a result, the public sector now accounts for a third of total employment. In an effort to reduce the imbalances, the government began developing a “home-grown” adjustment program in late 1994 with the assistance of the ECCB and CDB, and a number of revenue measures were introduced that led to a I percentage point increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio in 1995, to 18% percent. 7. In response to the constraint on external financing since the beginning of the 199Os, the government has resorted to borrowing from the domestic banking system, secured through the earmarking of oil taxes and other revenues; an accumulation of arrears to the rest of the public sector (permitting more government spending); supplier financing of some public investment projects; and private sector participation in an infrastructure project in the elec- tricity sector through a build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) arrangement. B. Recent Developments 8. Two hurricanes in September 1995 caused extensive damage to the country’s eco- nomic infrastructure, and the attendant disruption to tourism led to a 5 percent decline in real GDP that year. Most hotels re-opened by the end of 1995, following a recovery of cruise-ship visitors. Economic activity picked up in 1996, particularly for tourism and construction, and real GDP recovered to the level of 1994, but the tourist industry has not yet fully recouped the lost ground (Figure 3). Stayover arrivals in the first seven months of 1997 were about 5 percent lower than in the corresponding period of 1995. Also, hotel rates, which were discounted in 1996, appear to be lagging behind prehurricane levels. 9. Inflation has remained low, owing to the discipline that results from membership in the Eastern Caribbean currency uniqn (Table 2). Wage increases have been subdued by a freeze 4The government paid neither employer nor employee contributions during the period 1990-95; the combined rate is 15.5 percent ofthe monthly wage up to EC$4,500.

The public sector deficit was halved in 1996, to less than 3 percent of GDP, owing to a recovery of earnings by the public utilities, higher tax revenues, and a reduction in public investment (Table 3). A tax compliance unit, established in the fust half of the year, helped boost revenues, including the collection of tax arrears. On the expenditure side, current non- interest spending declined slightly in relation to GDP, but the reductions in the wage bill and the scaling down of the vocational training scheme that had been announced in the budget did not take place.6 As in the past, the deficit was financed by an accumulation of external arrears. The improvement in budgetary performance in 1996 led the government to resume partial payments of social security contributions, though not to the medical benefits scheme, and domestic arrears continued to rise. At the beginning of 1997, however, the government again stopped its contributions to the social security scheme. 11. The intlow of insurance payments from abroad in late 1995--after the hurricanes-led to a buildup of bank deposits that exceeded credit expansion, and the commercial banks increased their net foreign asset position (Table 4). During 1996 and the first half of 1997 broad money (M2) was virtually unchanged. Over the same period, private investment was buoyant and the growth of private sector credit brisk, and banks met liquidity needs by reducing their net foreign asset position. Bank interest rates were stable during 1996 and the first half of 1997. There were signs of upward pressure on deposit rates in the third quarter of 1997, especially on large deposits, in response to continued high loan demand and relatively tight liquidity in the banking system. The quality of bank portfolios has recovered somewhat in 1997, following the post-hurricane rise in loan delinquency during 1996; the proportion of nonperforming loans in total bank credit rose from 8.4 percent in September 1995 to 12.1 per- cent at end-1996, and subsequently declined to 10.5 percent in June 1996. 12. The external current account deficit rose to about 18 percent of GDP in 1996, as the reinsurance intlows had largely subsided by the beginning of that year, tourism receipts remained weak, and imports rose in response to the reconstruction activity (Table 5). The deficit was financed mainly by a drawdown of the banks’ net foreign assets (as noted above), direct investment, and the public sector’s buildup of arrears. An appreciation of the Antiguan currency in real effective terms since mid-1995, according to INS data, mainly reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar-to which the E.C. dollar is pegged-against most European currencies during the same period (Figure 4). However, according to an alternative index of ‘More than 4,300 annual work permits were issued to immigrant workers in 1996, representing about 15 percent of the work force. 6Trimming the wage bill was to have been accomplished through selective reductions in the work week, privatization of some government activities, temporary layoffs, and the removal of pensioners from the payroll.

An estimated 3,000 Montserratian nationals have arrived in Antigua since the volcano on that island started erupting in July 1995, and some 300-400 are estimated to have been absorbed into the work force. To compensate the government of Antigua and Barbuda for the cost of schooling and health care for the refugees, the U.K. government offered a package of assistance totaling an estimated f5-7 million that includes a cash grant, a write-off of external debt-service obligations to end-1999, and aid to help establish Modserratians in jobs. III. REPORT ON THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS A. Overview and Outlook for 1997 14. The discussions centered on fiscal policy and the authorities’ external debt strategy. The mission also discussed the government’s development strategy. The lack of access to external financing and difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources have reduced public investment to levels which underscore the need to boost public savings. The authorities acknowledge the need to tackle the arrears problem and restore the government’s credit- worthiness, but prefer not to take strong actions that might jeopardize the economy’s growth needs in the short run. 15. Real GDP growth is projected to slow down to about 3 percent in 1997; tourism continues to recover, while a sharp deceleration of construction activity reflects the winding down of post-hurricane reconstruction. Inflation remains subdued. In the non-hotel (private) sector, wages are projected to rise by around 5 percent in 1997. Monetary projections for 1997 assume a deceleration in private sector credit in the second half of the year, with the slowing of private investment, and a gradual resumption in the growth of monetary aggre- gates. The external current account deficit is projected to narrow to 13 percent of GDP in 1997, based on firther recovery of tourism earnings. B. Fiscal Policy 16. The home-grawn adjustment program initiated in 1994 lost momentum in I996 as regards expenditure measures, and with no significant revenue measures this year, it remains stalled. Despite a pickup in cur&t expenditure, the authorities’ plans for 1997 also included several public investment projects. The mission projected roughly a doubling of the fiscal deficit in 1997, to 6 percent of GDP, made possible by stepped-up borrowing from local banks (to be secured in most cases by earmarking revenue) and a lowering of cash payments for external debt service. Since the new debt adds to future payment obligations that already exceed what can be sustained, the mission recommended against fLrther borrowing on commercial terms until the debt-service burden is brought down to manageable levels.

The initial success of the tax compliance unit resulted in part Ram the collection of tax arrears; the unit also audited hotels, helped the Inland Revenue Department detect tax evasion by restaurants, and raised collections of other taxes, notably on vehicle imports. The mission suggested that the work on improving systems for the collection of current tax liabilities warranted greater emphasis than the collection of arrears since this would likely yield the greatest lasting gains, and the unit’s work priorities should be refocused accordingly. 18. The lack of tax buoyancy in the past is related in part to the widespread granting of tax exemptions. The most important of these, waivers of import taxes, rose from the equivalent of 3.2 percent of GDP in 1993 to 8.8 percent in 1996, owing in part to post-hurricane waivers. The mission recommended that the discretionary waivers be curtailed, with exemptions limited to what is provided by the Hotels Aid Ordinance and Fiscal Incentives Act. The authorities indicated that post-hurricane waivers would continue to be issued to hotels that had not started reconstruction yet. 19. The mission also recommended that more be done to increase direct taxation, given the limited scope for raising indirect taxes further.’ It noted that, despite the apparent resis- tance to introducing a personal income tax, the education levy currently in effect was similar in several respects to the tax on earnings recommended by FAD in 1993. The authorities said they planned to reform the property tax by the end of 1997, mainly by making more properties taxable.* Also, they noted the possibility of re-introducing a personal income tax, but only after the March 1999 general election. Meanwhile, efforts to boost collections of the business (income) tax were set back by a recent court decision on the licensing of professional services. The govemment should take the steps needed to broaden the application of the business tax and harmonize it with the corporate income tax at a uniform rate. 20. Nonwage current expenditure grew rapidly in the first half of 1997, while the wage freeze has helped restrain the growth of the government wage bill. The mission cautioned that the increases in nonwage spending this year underscore the need for continued wage restraint in the public sector (negotiations will start later this year on wage increases that could have effect from September 1997) and for efforts to contain the spending pressures that are likely to emerge as the election draws closer. The authorities acknowledged the existence of overstaffing in the public sector, but indicated that they plan to rely only on attrition for reductions in employment. ‘The burden of indirect taxes, which account for 85 percent of tax revenue, falls largely on the tourism sector and on imports. The taxation of imports is constrained by commitments to the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) common external tariff. *The base would be shifted Tom annual rental to capital value, and the tax extended to undeveloped lands currently exempt.

Public investment is expected to rise from 4 percent of GDP in 1996 to 7 percent of GDP in 1997, and a finther sharp rise is planned for 1998. Part of the increase in 1997 is for much-needed investment in infrastructure, notably for roads. The mission noted that a question remains as to whether the other investments address the most urgent needs, since the selection of projects did not follow a public investment plan with clearly identified priorities. One of the ongoing investment projects is a handicraft vendors mall and expansion of a government hotel that had been slated for privatization in 1996. C. External Sector Policies 22. The authorities recognize that the accumulation of external arrears has adversely affected the govemment’s creditworthiness and its access to fresh money from external sources.9 However, they remain reluctant to address the arrears problem in a multilateral framework, which-since most arrears are to bilateral creditors-would require a Fund- supported program. Apart from a desire to avoid the political cost that such an approach is believed to entail, the authorities expect to obtain better terms by restructuring some large loans through their bilateral strategy than under the aegis of the Paris Club. 23. Under this strategy, arrears to the Caribbean Development Bank were cleared by cash payments in 1996-97, after which lending from that institution resumed. Also, an agreement is understood to be near on the restructuring of a Japanese loan fully in arrears (estimated at US%56 million, or 10 percent of GDP, including interest on arrears). The staff noted that the proposed restructuring of this loan does not appear to entail much reduction in present value of the debt, and thus may commit the government to future debt-service payments (out of earmarked revenue from the consumption duty on oil imports) that will reduce further the scope for servicing other external debts. While noting that the proposed restructuring of the Japanese loan would settle arrears with one important creditor, the mission suggested that the bilateral approach does not represent the fastest or surest way to restore creditworthiness. In any case, it would be important as a next step to establish contact with all external creditors and reconcile the amounts.of the outstanding debt. 24. In the area of trade policy, the second phase of implementation of the CARJCOM common external tariff (CET) had been planned for September 1995 but was postponed following the post-hutricane drop in fiscal revenue. ” The government intends to complete its phasing in of the CET in January 1998, bringing the maximum tariff down to 20 percent. It is planned that other taxes, notably consumption duties, will be raised to ‘compensate for the loss wore than 90 percent of the increase in arrears over the last three years relates to loans from the 198Os, as there have been few disbursements of foreign loans since 1990. “The current maximum tariff rate of 35 percent (apart from a few exceptions at 40,45, or 70 percent) was to have been reduced to 25 percent during the second phase of implementation of the CET.

The mission questioned the consistency of the customs service charge (5 percent of imports) with the commitments under the CET and with the WI0 rules. The authorities explained that the service charge did not contravene either the commitments to CARICOM or, in their view, WTO rules. D. Development Strategy 25. The government’s development strategy aims to re-establish Antigua’s niche in the upper end of the tourism market. The authorities are currently negotiating a package of fiscal and other concessions for a large tourist facility of up to 1,000 hotel rooms and associated amenities. They acknowledged that the concessions might be generous, but saw them as important for attracting tourism projects on the scale being proposed. 26. The mission recognized that the promotion of luxury tourism could be the appropriate strategy for Antigua. However, concessions should be granted in the context of a uniform policy for the sector, consistent with the CARICOM agreement on harmonixed incentives. Also, concerns have been raised over the environmental impact of the proposed large tourism project, and the mission recommended that these concerns be addressed in the context of a well-defined policy on protection of the environment, based on legislation that was proposed in 1996 but has yet to be adopted. It would be important for investment projects to take account of environmental impact assessments where relevant. 27. The establishment of a quasi-public Tourism Development Corporation this year offers the prospect of more effective marketing of Antiguan tourism. The mission recommended that a 1 percentage point surcharge on the existing hotel guest tax be introduced to fimd the corporation’s tourism promotion activities. The authorities agreed to give serious considera- tion to this tax increase. The mission also suggested that all hotel taxes be consolidated into a single ad valorem rate at the same time, thus simplifying the administration of such taxes. 28. To promote economic diversification over the medium term, the government hopes to attract investors to the free trade zone that has been established mainly for light manufac- turing. Also, a grant-financed fisheries project starting in 1998 could give a boost to the fishing sector. E. Structural Policies 29. Privatization is proceeding slowly. The planned sale of the Heritage Hotel and government equity in other property near the waterfront was postponed beyond 1996. Informal efforts to find a buyer for the Royal Antiguan Hotel-the island’s second largest-are continuing, while plans for other asset sales remain to be defined. The mission recommended that the government establish a timed plan for future asset sales, and that the proceeds of all asset sales be set aside to reduce the external arrears overhang. Serious consideration should be given to divestiture of the utilities; relatively high production costs (including overstaffing) indicate inefficiencies in the production of electricity and water. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- I5 - 30. The mission discussed with the authorities issues of governance. It noted that high priority should be given to the curtailment of the discretionary tax exemptions mentioned previously; to greater transparency and accountability in budgetary procedures;” and to the compilation and publication of fiscal and trade data. Another potentially relevant aspect of governance is the centralization of important economic initiatives, which tends to inhibit transparent procedures and blur the lines of authority. In such cases, the relevant line minis- tries should provide the technical support needed for consistent policy formulation and implementation. The mission also suggested that concessions for build, own operate and transfer (BOOT) projects and contracts for public investments should follow transparent procedures of competitive bidding. 31. Growing concern over possible money laundering through offshore banks registered in Antigua and Barbuda has led to a number of remedial actions over the last year, namely, the promulgation in early 1997 of a new law on money laundering, the closure of several insti- tutions not complying with the required reporting, and the approval of funding for a local task force being established to monitor offshore financial institutions.” The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force has scheduled a “mutual evaluation” for early 1998 to assess Antigua and Barbuda’s anti-laundering efforts. The mission welcomed these steps, given the importance of ensuring adequate regulation of offshore as well as onshore banks, and noted that the chai- lenge will be to do what is needed for effective enforcement of the new law. F. Medium-Term Outlook 32. There is a need to raise public investment in infrastructure to levels that would support sustained growth of the economy, especially tourism. This boost should take place in the con- text of a comprehensive fiscal program for the medium term, including a properly prioritixed investment program, that would help raise public savings, tackle the external arrears problem, and aim at sustainable levels of external debt. The mission recommended that, for this purpose, the authorities update the fiscal framework, encompassing the statutory bodies, that they presented at a donors meeting in mid-1996. 33. The levels of public investment projected for 1997-99 are substantially higher than in the early 199Os, and could exceed 10 percent of GDP near the end of the decade. In addition, “One important step in this direction would be to revise the outdated budgeting and account- ing procedures. Such a revision should draw on the dratl financial regulations prepared several years ago but not yet approved, and on the experience of other Eastern Caribbean countries with recent legislative changes in this area. ‘*The vulnerability of the offshore sector to money laundering was heightened for many years by a lax regulatory framework and weak supervision. For a discussion of this issue, including the government’s recent efforts to inhibit money laundering, see Appendix I to the companion paper on recent economic developments.

More- over, the investment proposals appear to give undue weight to the prospects for obtaining tinancing, as opposed to where the investment needs are most pressing, and they do not adequately take account of the implications of proposed investments for tirture recurrent costs. 34. The mission prepared medium-term projections based on two scenarios regarding fiscal policy (Tables 7 and 8). The baseline scenario reflects the policies announced to date, and assumes the partial development of the proposed tourist village. In this case, the public sector deficit would average almost 8 percent of GDP in 1998-99, and then decline to about 4% percent of GDP, limited by the available financing, as the foreign financing for public investment projects in 1997-98 is unlikely to be sustained. With the exception of loans from the CDB, most foreign and domestic borrowing continues to be secured through the earmarking of government revenues, and few countries are likely to resume bilateral lending. The largest of the new credits, a private loan for US%3 1 million on commercial terms for the construction of a new hospital, will be secured through the earmarking of contributions to the medical benefits scheme. 35. Medium-term projections under an alternative scenario assume a strengthening of the fiscal position that would provide a basis for tackling the public sector’s excessive debt burden. A combination of revenue and expenditure measures is assumed that would permit the public sector to stop the accumulation of external arrears while maintaining public investment of at least 6 percent of GDP.” The fiscal effort, resulting in particular from increases in tax revenue relative to GDP, would boost the current primary balance by 4% percentage points of GDP by the end of the period, relative to the baseline scenario. In addition to facilitating higher sustainable public investment, the fiscal consolidation would result in a significant lowering of the external debt burden (see Tables 7 and 8). Over the medium term, this would provide a more solid basis for sustaining adequate levels of public investment in infrastructure, helping to put the economy on a higher growth path than under the baseline scenario. @The contract was awarded initially to a US. firm without competitive bidding; domestic investors are being given the opportunity to find financing to match the terms of the first contract. “Public investment in other Eastern Caribbean countries exceeds this level (Figure 5). Whether this level of public investment proves adequate over the medium term will depend in part on the role of the private sector in providing infrastructure, whether through privatixation of the utilities or through BOOT arrangements.

The authorities expressed a clear preference for maintaining the U-month consultation cycle, explaining that they valued the Fund’s independent assessment and technical guidance. Iv. STAFF APPRAISAL 37. The economy recovered in 1996 from severe hurricane damage. The recovery of tourism up to mid-1997 was only partial, however, suggesting the need to remain vigilant in preserving and enhancing the competitiveness of Antiguan tourism. The main underpinnings of such a strategy would be a correction of the fiscal imbalance, permitting public investment to be sustained at levels sufficient to maintain and expand the economic infrastructure; protection of the environment, undoubtedly one of the country’s most important natural resources; a wages policy supportive of the need to maintain the cost competitiveness of Antiguan tourism; and the effective marketing of Antiguan tourism. For such a forward-looking strategy to achieve its objectives for growth, the key challenge continues to be the need to bolster public savings and normalize relations with external creditors. 38. The public finances improved in 1996, but the improvement appears to have been transitory, as some of the measures announced in 1996 aimed at reducing the wage bill and lowering other current spending have not been implemented, and no significant revenue measures were introduced in 1997. There is likely to be a brisk upswing in public investment over the next year or two in an effort to make up for inadequate levels of public investment in the past. This sharp rise in capital expenditure is unlikely to he sustainable in the absence of a pronounced increase in public savings, and will further weaken the government’s ability to service its external obligations. 39. At the same time, public investment needs to be increased to provide the infrastructure for tourism and other private sector activity. To this end, the staff encourages the authorities to formulate, possibly with the assistance from the CDB, a public investment program that establishes clear investment priorities within a medium-term framework and provides a basis for well-articulated project selection criteria, 40. The staff also would urge the authorities to revive the medium-term fiscal and macro- economic framework that was presented to donors in 1996, and establish a program for the medium term with specific fiscal measures and revenue and expenditure targets consistent with the alternative medium-term scenario elaborated by the staff and discussed with the authorities. Such a program should incorporate contingency plans in case the proposed fiscal measures do not have the expected yield. Implementation of the program will require a concerted effort to monitor public sector expenditure. 41. The needed fiscal consolidation will require hard choices, including between higher taxes and the streamlining of government payrolls. The government should mount a campaign Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- for a national consensus on the need for fiscal consolidation, and how best to achieve it. Improved transparency and accountability of government operations will help build public confidence and enhance the prospects for such a consensus. This should be part of a broader strategy for promoting good governance. 42. The tax effort should be increased by curbing discretionary tax exemptions, as noted, especially those on imports, and the two main revenue collection agencies should be strength- ened. The tax compliance unit’s efforts to increase collections and reduce evasion also should be supported. In view of the size of the fiscal imbalance, there will be a need to increase taxation in certain areas, including in the area of property and income taxes. 43. The authorities recognize that there is overstafEng in the public sector--both in the government and the statutory bodies-but are relying on attrition to achieve reductions in the public service. The staff urges the authorities to give greater priority to lowering the govem- ment’s wage bill; this is best tackled both from the side of employment and through restraint in the upcoming public sector wage negotiations. 44. The public enterprises, in particular the public utilities, should contribute to the fiscal consolidation effort through a combination of higher revenues (including public tariff increases and the collection of unpaid bills) and lower costs (includiig through reductions in over- staffing). The decision to engage the private sector in power generation through a long-term contract prior to transfer of the plant to the public sector holds out the potential for lowering production costs, but the contract was awarded without competitive bidding, giving little assurance of obtaining the additional energy supply at the lowest cost. On a related issue, the statfurges the authorities to accelerate the pace of privatisation, increasing the private sector’s role in the provision of basic services, and providing resources for the reduction of the external debt overhang. 45. The authorities have pursued a bilateral debt strategy that has led to a resumption of lending from the CDB, and agreement is near on the rescheduling of a large overdue loan. Nonetheless, in the staffs view, this approach does not offer the prospect of a rapid regularization of the external arrears situation, and access to new credits. On the contrary-absent a vigorous, heavily front-loaded fiscal adjustment to raise public savings--the financing arrangements that appear to be in prospect for a number of public sector projects and the earmarking of revenue for future debt service may well further reduce the government’s capacity to service its debts. The government should intensify its contacts with other external creditors, initially to clarify the size of the outstanding debt, and subse- quently to reach understandings on the steps needed to normal& relations with these creditors. 46. Other steps to foster good governance would include the identification and elimination of unproductive expenditure; the elimination of discretionary tax exemptions; and vigorous follow-up in the efforts to prevent money laundering. The actions taken by the government to address concerns over money laundering are welcome, in particular the introduction of a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - comprehensive anti-laundering law. Its effective enforcement should be pursued with determination. 41. The present exchange rate arrangements have provided an important source of monetary and exchange rate stability in Antigua and Barbuda, despite the weak state of the public finances. To safeguard competitiveness, efforts will be needed to control wage costs. 48. There is an urgent need to improve the quality, scope, and timeliness of statistics-particularly fiscal and trade dam-to help in economic palicy formutation and Fund surveillance. Needed improvements include the reconciliation of revenue and expenditure data with financing data, the monitoring of statutory bodies’ finances, and the timely compilation of customs import data. To provide the basis for a more reliable consumer price index, work should commence on a household budget survey. 49.

The government’s efforts to strengthen the Statistics Division (SD) of the Ministry of Finance through an internal reorganization and the hiring of new staff-mentioned in the 1996 staffreport-have been slow in producing results. Most of the shortcomings in the economic data noted there, remain to be addressed. Real sector Annual GDP estimates by sector are produced by the SD and reviewed by an expert from the ECCB. There are no official estimates for the expenditure components of GDP. In 1997, the base year for the constant price GDP series was changed to 1990. The sector estimates- based on surveys with low response rates, audited financial statements, and other available indicators-are reported with a significant lag. No quarterly indicators of economic activity are currently produced. The project to undertake a new household survey to serve as a basis for an offtcial consumer price index has been successively postponed. The unofficial consumer price index compiled by the SD is volatile and unreliable. It was introduced originally as a temporary measure follow- ing a 1993 technical assistance mission. For several subgroups, prices are kept unchanged for a number of months and then changed abruptly, often distorting the subgroup’s contribution to inflation. There is little coverage of labor market developments, as no official data for wages or unemployment are available. Financial sector Monetary survey data are compiled by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) on a monthly basis. The data are reported to the Fund regularly, although the timeliness of data on central bank operations (lag of six weeks) could be improved. The monetary survey does not include the accounts of credit unions that accept demand deposits. The ECCB is aware of the need to improve the coverage of the monetary statistics and has taken steps to collect reliable data on credit unions. Fiscal sector No fiscal data are reported to STA for publication by the Fund. The authorities compile quarterly data on central government revenue and expenditure, and partial annual data on the financing of the central government deficit. However, reporting lags for government expendi- ture have lengthened substantially over the last year. Although the public enterprises and the Social Security and Medical Benefits Schemes produce annual financial statements, these are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-31- APPENDIX II subject to long lags and are not monitored adequately by the Ivlinistry of Finance. High priority needs to be given to more timely reporting of central government revenues and expenditures on both a cash and accrual basis; the reconciliation of the above- and below-the- line accounts of the central government; and the compilation of consolidated public sector accounts. External sector External trade data prepared by the SD are compiled manually and subject to long lags (the most recent annual trade report is for 1990). The SD is planning to shift to the ASYCUDN EUBOTRACE computerised system of import data currently used in several other Caribbean countries. Plans for compiling these import data have been in a developmental stage since 1995, and a pilot project is underway. The SD compiles balance of payments data on an annual basis, with assistance from the ECCB. However, the data are not published, and are subject to a high degree of estimation. The h4inistry of Finance uses a debt reporting system to produce data on cash external debt transactions and provisional calculations of arrears for part of the country’s external obliga- tions. The ECCB is providing assistance in broadening the coverage of the debt reporting system to include all external public sector obligations.
