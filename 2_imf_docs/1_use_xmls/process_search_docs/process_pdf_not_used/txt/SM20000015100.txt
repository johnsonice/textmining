While a more difficult external environment contributed, rapid credit growth and a larger fiscal deficit than earlier believed, reflecting higher public investment, were also responsible. (The fiscal deficit for 1998/99 has been revised upward substantially, and data for earlier years may also need to be revised; uncertainties about the fiscal data make the role of fiscal policy difficult to assess). Also, the pace of structural reform slowed after mid-1998. During 1999/00, however, credit growth has been reduced significantly and steps have been taken to cut back public investment and reduce the fiscal deficit. At the same time, the pace of privatization has picked up, and plans for tax and other reforms are being formulated. With the tightening of macroeconomic policies, the reserve loss has slowed but there are also indications that economic growth is weakening, possibly quite sharply. Policy Issues The immediate task facing the authorities is to consolidate the stabilization of international reserves, while limiting the slowdown in economic growth. This will require that further fiscal consolidation and slower credit growth be combined with a reinvigoration of structural reform to help bolster investor confidence. While a relatively rapid recovery is possible, a period of slower growth cannot be ruled out. The pound has appreciated considerably during the 199Os, and while part of this has been offset by debt reduction and structural reform, there has also been a significant loss in competitiveness. The slowdown in growth, the small size of the nonoil export sector, and declining market shares, all point to the need to address competitiveness concerns. Sustaining rapid growth over the medium term will depend crucially on the pace of reform. Particularly important will be further progress with trade liberalization supported by improvements in competitiveness; the implementation of the authorities’ ambitious privatization plans will also be key. While progress has been made in strengthening banking regulation and supervision in recent years, scope remains for further improvement, including as regard onsite inspection of public sector banks. The slowdown in the economy following a period of rapid credit growth makes this a priority. Progress has been made in revising and reconciling the fiscal data, but further work urgently needs to be done, especially for earlier years. The audit of the NIB is welcome and needs to be conducted expeditiously. Participation in the fiscal module of the Report on Standards and Codes and a review of fiscal reporting formats is strongly recommended. Institutional reforms to improve control and monitoring of aspects of the budget related to investment expenditure are also urgently needed.

This paper summarizes the discussions for the 2000 Article IV consultation with Egypt, which were held in Cairo during April 1 l-May 4, 2000.’ Mr. Fischer also visited Cairo during May 23-24, meeting with President Mubarak as well as Prime Minister Ebeid. 2. In concluding the last Article IV consultation on January 11, 1999, Executive Directors commended the authorities for the remarkably strong performance of the economy in recent years. However, they also underscored the significant challenges facing Egypt, including on balance of payments pressures, and called on the authorities to monitor external developments carefully. Directors were updated on developments in Egypt at Country Matters Sessions in May 1999 and in April 2000. 3. The 2000 Article IV consultation discussions focused on short-term prospects, including the need to strengthen macroeconomic policies and further stabilize international reserves, as well as on the structural reforms needed to sustain growth over the medium term. The discussions also concentrated on revisions to the fiscal data and improvements in its monitoring, and on measures to strengthen control over public investment. 4. Egypt has not accepted the obligations of Article VIII, and maintains a number of bilateral payments arrangements subject to approval under Article VIII, sections 2(a) and 3. II. BACKGROUND 5. Egypt’s economic performance during the 1990s was generally strong. Spurred by a major fiscal consolidation and broad-based economic reform, economic growth rose substantially;reaching 5-6 percent by the end of the decade. At the same time, inflation was steadily reduced to a rate comparable to that in major industrial countries. Also, international reserves rose to high levels, and external debt was kept low, with a favorable maturity profile. Although much remains to be done to further reduce the role of the public sector and liberalize trade, Egypt made considerable progress with economic reforms during the decade. These relatively strong economic fundamentals helped Egypt to weather well the financial turbulence in emerging markets during 1997-98. ‘The Egyptian representatives were led by Dr. Boutros-Ghali (Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade) and included the Ministers of Finance, Planning, Domestic Trade and Supply, and Public Enterprises, and the Governor of the central bank. The mission also met with Prime Minister Ebeid. Mr. Shaalan, Executive Director for Egypt, and Mrs. Farid, Advisor to the ED, participated in the meetings. The staff team comprised Messrs. Bennett (head), Mazarei and Ms. Zhou (all MED), Messrs. Allen and Bingham (FAD), Messrs. Habermeier and Ramsey (consultant) (MAE), and Ms. Desai (PDR), and was assisted by Mr. Mecagni (Resident Representative in Cairo). Mr. Burton (MED) joined the mission for the policy _ discussions.

Recently, some less favorable trends have emerged especially deterioration in the external position and a steady loss in reserves. While exogenous shocks and a less favorable international economic environment certainly contributed to these developments, macroeconomic policies were also partly responsible. In particular, domestic credit growth was rapid during the second half of the 1990s and fiscal policy was more expansionary late in the decade than originally believed as a result of higher investment spending on large-scale projects. (Although the fiscal deficit for 1998/99 has recently been revised upward substantially, data for earlier years need to be reviewed, making it difficult to assess the role of fiscal policy). Also, the pace of economic reform has slowed since the end of the Stand-By Arrangement in mid- 1998. 7. Following the presidential referendum in September 1999, President Mubarak appointed Dr. Ebeid (formerly Minister of Public Enterprise) as Prime Minister and a new Cabinet and Economic Team were formed in October. III. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS DURING 1998/99 AND 1999/00* A. Activity and Inflation 8. Real GDP growth increased to 6 percent in 1998/99 from 5.7 percent in 1997/98, according to national accounts data. This reflected relatively expansionary macroeconomic policies, with credit growth continuing to be rapid and the fiscal deficit considerably larger than earlier estimated. As discussed below, the higher fiscal deficit reflects the expansion in the public investment program, which likely had significant knock on effects in related activities. Industrial activity and construction were particularly robust, although other sectors, such as tourism, were also very strong. Unemployment continued its downward trend (to 7.9 percent by the end of 1998/99). 9. Growth is tentatively estimated at about 5 percent in 1999/00. While growth remained robust in the first half of 1999/00, there are now signs that it is slowing, possibly quite sharply. Partial indicators of activity in cement and steel production suggest falling output in these sectors, but up-to-date comprehensive indicators (such as industrial production) are not available. The slowdown reflects a substantial cutback in public investment and a reduction in the rate of credit growth. 10. Inflation continued to fall during 1998/99. From 4.5 percent in June 1998, the rate of annual consumer price inflation fell to 2.9 percent in June 1999, and it has remained stable at around 3 percent since then. This good performance, despite the strength of domestic * Fiscal years are July to June. Economic developments are also discussed in the accompanying background paper.

B. Fiscal Developments 11. The fiscal deficit in 1998/99 has been revised upward following a review of the fiscal data.3 Because of concerns about the scale of government investment in large-scale or “mega” projects as well as about discrepancies between debt and financing data, the new government initiated a review of the fiscal data for 1998/99 in late 1999 (see Box I). The review, which revealed weaknesses in the compilation of fiscal data, had the following main findings: l The fiscal deficit for 1998/99 needed to be revised upward to 4.2 percent of GDP from the earlier estimate of 1.3 percent of GDP.* l The upward revision reflected mostly higher investment expenditure financed through the National Investment Bank (NIB).5 The additional investment expenditures were 3 The fiscal deficit covers central government, local government, General Authority for the Supply of Commodities (GASC), and National Investment Bank. It also includes investment expenditures of the public economic authorities, but not the public sector companies. * While the debt and financing data have been broadly reconciled, there remain gaps in staffs understanding of some budgetary operations for 1998/99. ’ The NIB operates as a government loan fund. Its primary mandate is to invest the surpluses of the national social insurance funds in public investment projects.

These have been treated below the line in the authorities’ presentation, pending clarification of the NIB’s operations (see below for details of the audit of the NIB). Including these net-lending operations above the line would raise the fiscal deficit in 1998/99 to 5.9 percent of GDP. l Sizable discrepancies exist between the debt and financing data for 1997/98 and earlier years, which suggest that the deficit in past years may also need to be revised, possibly substantially. The government announced to the ublic the upward revision to the fiscal deficit for 1998/99 to 4.2 percent of GDP in late May. B This announcement was combined with a statement regarding the government’s economic policy program, including its plans for reducing the fiscal deficit, as discussed below. The market response to the announcement of larger fiscal deficit was relatively subdued. However, more recently, Standard and Poor, while maintaining their investment grade credit rating, have revised the outlook from stable to negative, partly reflecting the revised fiscal data. 12. Revisions to the fiscal outturn for 1998/99 do not raise misreporting issues, since: (i) there was no Fund arrangement in effect during 1998/99, and (ii) fiscal data are not covered by Article VIII section 5 (unless relevant for performance criteria). Revisions to 1997/98 and earlier years would cover periods when arrangements were in effect; revisions would not involve the Guidelines on Misreporting as no purchases were made (the last two arrangements were precautionary and the earlier arrangement is beyond the statute of limitations applicable under these guidelines); should it appear that reported data were incorrect, however, it might raise issues under Article VIII, Section 5 as the data involved were relevant for the performance criteria under the arrangements, concerning the fiscal deficit and its domestic financing. The staff has raised the issue of possible misreporting with the authorities and has proposed a technical assistance mission to review the fiscal reporting system (see Section VI. G). This technical assistance could also address questions regarding whether the correct data was reported to the Fund. The staff will report to the Executive Board on this issue by November 30,200O. 6 The revised data have been published.

Fiscal Data Issues The fiscal data in Egypt suffer from a number of problems, chief of which relate to discrepancies between data on the stock of domestic debt and reported domestic financing flows. To a large extent, these data problems derive from the operations of the National Investment Bank (NIB) and the way in which the investment budget is n&aged, controlled, and financed. In particular, the split in responsibilities between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning over the investment budget has impeded control over expenditures (see discussion in paragraphs 39-41), and is the principal cause of the difficulties in the reconciliation and reporting of fiscal data. Key factors that have contributed to the emergence of discrepancies are as follows: The Ministry of Finance (MOF) does not have an integrated accounting system under its control. Recurrent expenditures are reported on a cash basis and monitored directly by the MOF, whereas investment expenditures are recorded on an accrual basis and reported to the MOF by the Ministry of Planning (MOP). As a consequence, there is no single comprehensive budget ledger maintained by the MOF. Monitoring of the fiscal accounts is also complicated by the fact that use of privatization proceeds and external grants is not fully consolidated with the rest of the budget. There is no effective institutional mechanism for reconciling debt and financing data. Authority over debt management is shared with the Central Bank of Egypt. Consequently, no single institution has clear responsibility for ensuring consistency of debt and financing reports. The accounts of the NIB may not be fully reliable. Shortcomings in accounting records of the NIB have prompted the government to initiate a comprehensive audit of the NIB. In addition to problems in the data on investment outlays, there is uncertainty about the level of outstanding arrears to suppliers. The government’s fiscal reports need to be reviewed. Over time, the data definitions used in monitoring the fiscal deficit and its financing have become increasingly unclear. Mapping between elements of the fiscal tables (such as capital transfers) and the constituent elements included in the government budget ne’eds to be clarified. 13. Data on government employment have also been revised. The latest data provided by the authorities show that, rather than declining as previously reported, government employment increased by 5.7 percent in 1996/97 and by 2.3 percent in 1997/98. Achieving a reduction in government employment of 2 percent in both 1996/97 and 1997/98 was an important commitment under the program supported by the Stand-By Arrangement approved on October 11, 1 996,7 and these targets were subsequently reported as having been met.* The 7 See EBS/96/149. ’ See EBS/98/107 and EBS/98/161. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- discrepancy between the latest and earlier data on government employment was discovered only recently following the return of the mission, and the staff is in contact with the authorities seeking clarification of the data revisions, and will report any additional information prior to the Board meeting. If the earlier employment data were inaccurate, this would not give rise to misreporting under Article VIII, Section 5 of the Articles of Agreement because the information is not of the type listed in that provision and was not explicitly required to be provided under a Board decision, either as a performance criterion or otherwise.’ 14. The higher fiscal deficit in 1998199 was financed mainly from the surpluses of the national social security funds. The NIB finances its operations mostly from the surpluses generated by these funds, although it also issues its own securities and borrows from other sources such as the postal savings scheme. The staff estimates that, including the social security fund surpluses, the consolidated balance was in deficit by only about 1 ‘/z percent of GDP in 1998/99 (Appendix 1, Table 3). Accounting for the social security fund surpluses explains why the upward revision to the fiscal deficit has not also required an upward revision to government borrowing from the banking system.” 15. The fiscal deficit is estimated to have declined from 4.2 percent of GDP in 1998/99 to 3.7 percent of GDP in 1999/00. This adjustment reflects a retrenchment of investment expenditure, where the government has taken steps to control capital outlays, mainly by restricting expenditure to projects already underway. Net lending by the NIB is also expected to have declined (to 1.4 percent of GDP) as tighter controls are implemented over extrabudgetary activities.” 16. A marked decline in government saving in recent years has adversely affected fiscal performance. Revenues have continued to decline relative to GDP as receipts from the 9 The Guidelines on Misreporting and Non-Complying Purchases would not apply either, as no purchases were made under the arrangement. lo The upward revisions to the fiscal deficit and to government investment also suggest that, given the (largely unchanged) external current account, the nongovernment savings/investment balance (including the social security funds) in 1998/99 was substantially more in surplus than earlier believed. Although the authorities have not yet revised the national accounts, staff has made some preliminary revisions to the national accounts for 1998/99 in light of the new fiscal data (Appendix 1, Table 6). The review of the fiscal accounts for the previous years, which the authorities will be undertaking, may indicate a need to review the national income accounts for those years as well. These problems make analysis of developments in the national income accounts difficult. ” While precise estimates of the surpluses of the social security funds in 1999/00 are not available, it is likely that the consolidated fiscal balance would also have declined to about 1 percent of GDP.

On the expenditure side, while nonwage current expenditures have been restrained, the wage bill has risen substantially over the past two years. Overall, government savings are estimated to have declined to around 2% percent of GDP in. 1999100, almost 2 points lower than in 1997/9X 17. Interpretation of fiscal policy (and also of credit developments) is complicated by the existence of government arrears (chiefly to contractors) that the government has promised to clear. A firm figure for the total amount has yet to be established pending clarification of the amount of bills in arrears in the NIB accounts and agreement between contractors and the government on bills i:n dispute. These arrears are believed to have accrued over a number of yearsI Further investigation into these arrears may therefore have a bearing on fiscal estimates for earlier years. Table 2.

The net domestic assets of the banking system (NDA) expanded rapidly in 1998/99 before slowing in 1999/00 (Figure 1). Developments in NDA were dominated by growth in credit to the nongovernment sector, which increased during 1998/99 to 21.5 percent (from 17.6 percent in 1997/98), before declinin March 2000), as monetary policy tightened during 1999/00. l? to 14.4 percent (as of The growth of credit to nongovernment declined further to 13.6 percent in April 2000. The rapid growth in credit demand in 1998/99 was probably related in part to increased economic activity surrounding public sector infrastructure projects. Banks continued to draw down their foreign assets to finance increased lending in early 1998/99, but by September 1998 banks’ net foreign position had fallen to a low level, and they turned instead to treasury bill redemption to finance credit growth, redeeming bills equivalent to 4.6 percent of GDP during the last three- quarters of 1998/99. This reduced banks’ holdings of treasury bill (and bond) holdings toward the minimum levels required by the statutory liquidity ratio. At that point, liquidity began to tighten quite sharply and credit growth started to slow. The slowdown in the growth of credit to the nongovernment sector during 1999/00 probably also reflected a weakening in credit demand, as cutbacks in public investment affected related nongovernment activities. 19. Reflecting the pattern of credit growth, the net foreign assets of the banking system (NFA) fell sharply in 1998/99 and more moderately in 1999/00. Of the decline in banking system net foreign assets of US$4.6 billion in 1998/99, approximately half was financed from the CBE’s international reserves, the remainder, however, was largely accounted for by a drawdown in CBE deposits with commercial banks (mostly in the first half of the year). Central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market continued in 1999/00: in the first three quarters of 1999/00, CBE external reserves fell by another US$3 billion to stand at US$14.7 billion at end-March 2000; during this period, however, commercial banks’ net foreign assets recovered by US$l billion, partly reflecting privatization receipts not banked with the CBE. At end-June 2000, CBE external reserves had recovered slightly to US$l5.0 billion. 20. The growth of the monetary aggregates increased in 1998/99, and then decelerated in 1999/00 as monetary conditions tightened and the economy slowed. Broad money growth picked up from 8% percent in 1997/98 to 11% percent in 1998199, before slowing again to 9 percent by the third quarter of 1999/00. This path broadly reflected the evolution of nominal GDP over the period. Base money growth followed a similar but somewhat more pronounced pattern. I3 The nongovernment sector includes the private sector and public sector companies, but excludes the public economic authorities (Suez Canal, public utilities, etc.). Credit to the nongovernment sector represents 80 percent of total banking system credit. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- Table 3.

Interbank interest rates reflected the tightening liquidity in the banking system in 1999/00, especially in the second and third quarters, rising to as high as 17 percent in January, before subsiding in the fourth quarter as credit demand eased and banks’ liquidity improved. Treasury bills rates, by contrast, rose only slightly over the past two years, remaining in the vicinity of 9 percent. The stability of treasury bill rates contributed to the heavy redemption of treasury bills in 1998/99, and hence to the rapid credit growth during that period. 22. Stock prices recovered strongly following the appointment of the new Cabinet in October 1999, on the basis of a pickup in foreign investor interest in the market in connection with privatization (Figure 2). This followed a decline in stock prices during the emerging markets crisis of 1997-98. Since the beginning of 2000, however, stock prices have suffered a sizable correction (about 24 percent to June 23). Table 4.

External Developments 23. Pressures on the external position intensified in 1998/99. While the current account deficit narrowed to 1.9 percent of GDP from 3 percent in 1997/98, unidentified outflows (possibly partly related to current account transactions) amounted to 1% percent of GDP, and the capital account moved into deficit. The narrowing of the current account deficit in 1998/99 owed mostly to the reversal of the shocks of 1997/98 (especially a rebound in tourism). Merchandise exports declined to about 5 percent of GDP, reflecting a sharp fall in oil exports; nonoil exports remained broadly unchanged in value terms. On the capital account, lower foreign direct investment combined with higher net official outflows and continuing portfolio outflows to generate a capital account deficit (excluding commercial banks) of US$1.6 billion in 1998/99. The overall deficit worsened to US$4.5 billion in 1998/99, from US$3.6 billion in 1997/98. 24. In 1999100, the external position improved, reflecting the tightening of macro- economic policies. The current account def’icit is estimated to have narrowed further in 1999/00 to 1.8 percent of GDP. This improvement was mainly on account of lower nonoil imports, reflecting, inter alia, a reversal of earlier stockpiling of commodities, a reduction in imports of capital goods related to the mega-projects, and the full year impact of tighter import credit requirements (100 percent cover) by banks. Unidentified outflows also declined, while the capital account moved back into balance, reflecting, in part, the resumption of privatizations. 25. Shortages of foreign exchange in the official foreign exchange market have occurred at times during the past two years. The inter-dealer exchange rate has occasionally risen above the official exchange rate, peaking at LE 3.70 per dollar at end- August 1999, by comparison to the official rate at the time of LE 3.4 1 per dollar. This differential has narrowed in recent months with the market rate subsiding to around LE 3.50 per dollar while the official rate has moved up to LE 3.47 per dollar, as of June 20, 2000.‘4 With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, the real effective exchange rate of the pound has continued to appreciate (see Section IV). Recent adjustments to the official rate have so far made little impact on this trend. 26. Egypt’s external debt indicators are fairly healthy (Appendix 1, Table 4). Total external debt stood at US$28 billion at end-1998/99 (32 percent of GDP), of which short- term debt amounted to only US$I .8 billion. Since then, short-term debt, according to official sources, has risen to US$2.3 billion (September 1999). Data from the BIS suggest a higher figure for short-term debt at end 1998/99 of US$4.8 billion, and indicate that this rose to US$7.2 billion in September (see paragraph 50). Even on the basis of the higher figure, net I4 In the absence of conclusive evidence that the divergence between the two rates arose from official action, the divergence does not constitute a multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval.

The authorities stated that all but a small amount of their international reserves were liquid.15 Table 5.

E. Structural Reforms 27. The pace of structural reform slowed during 1998/99, but has more recently begun to pick up. Privatizations were mainly confined to liquidations and employee buyouts of small firms during 1998/99, pending a reconsideration of the modalities of future privatization-leading to a greater emphasis on anchor investors and on privatizations that involved changes in management. Privatization activity began to recover in early 1999/00 when several large cement companies were sold. Financial market development has been facilitated by a number of recent moves to: (i) set up a depository system for securities; (ii) promulgate a code of conduct for portfolio management companies and brokerage firms; (iii) permit companies to issue bonds upon receiving a credit rating from a certified agency; and (iv) further liberalize the insurance sector. Some further recent steps have been taken in I5 At end-1999, official reserves stood at US$l5.6 billion (including about US$500 million in gold), of which about US$600 million were not fully liquid (mostly balance related to bilateral and other payments arrangements).

MACROECONOMICPOLICYISSUES 28. A major immediate challenge for economic policy in the current circumstances is to consolidate progress in stabilizing international reserves, while limiting the short- run impact of the stabilization on output. This challenge is complicated by the need to restore confidence in fiscal policy following the recent data revisions. The authorities and the staff were in broad agreement that a combination of macroeconomic restraint, including further fiscal consolidation, and reinvigorated structural reforms was the appropriate policy strategy. The continuing loss of competitiveness, on account of strength of the U.S. dollar, and the need to strengthen fiscal data and control over public investment were also discussed. A. Fiscal Policy 29. Under current policies, the fiscal deficit is projected to decline to 3.4 percent in 2000/01. Additional retrenchment in investment expenditures is projected, but with revenues broadly stable in relation to GDP, upward pressure on recurrent expenditure (notably the wage bill) is expected to result in a further decline in government savings to 1.8 percent of GDP. NIB net lending operations are projected to decline to 1 percent of GDP. 30. The staff suggested that a somewhat larger decline in the fiscal deficit in 2000/01 (to about 3 percent of GDP) would do more to re-establish confidence in fiscal management in the context of the publication of the data revisions, although it acknowledged the need to avoid unduly compounding the slowdown in economic growth and to take into account the stronger position of the consolidated fiscal balance. The staff advised that the additional adjustments come through steps to increase government savings, and that efforts focus in particular on containing the wage bill and strengthening non-oil domestic revenue. The staff also noted that there were some downside risks to the fiscal outlook including the possibility of lower economic growth and renewed overruns on investment spending. The authorities were confident that the budget targets could be achieved, but indicated that they were ready to implement additional measures if this proved necessary. 31. Provisions have been made in the 2000/01 budget for the settlement of bills in dispute or in arrears. The staff expressed concerns that the arrears that need to be settled may exceed amounts provisionally budgeted. The authorities indicated that, in that event, the I6 Ministerial Decree No. 6 19 (November 1998), required consumer goods imported into Egypt to be directly shipped from their country of origin, thus ruling out distribution from regional warehouses and distribution centers. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- program of arrears clearance would be managed in a manner that avoids additional borrowing from the banking system, including through additional privatization receipts. B. Monetary Policy 32. Monetary policy has a key role to play in further stabilizing the reserve position. The staff discussed with the authorities a monetary framework for the period through end- June 2001 (Appendix 1; Table 5). The scenario assumes a continuation of the recent exchange rate policy. In the scenario, the demand for liquidity (M2) is expected to grow at around 9’% percent in 2000/01; this is consistent with continued low inflation and some slowdown in growth as macroeconomic policies are tightened. In order to achieve a stabilization of reserves at the still comfortable level of about US$141/2 billion, the growth of credit to the nongovernment sector (privat.e sector and public sector companies) would need to slow further to 11-12 percent by end-2000/01. 33. Interest rate flexibility will be needed to keep monetary policy on an appropriate course. As noted, rigidity in treasury bill interest rates contributed in 1998/99 to the large- scale redemption of treasury bills, which was an important factor behind the rapid credit expansion during that period. Looking forward, maintaining firm monetary control may require increases in treasury bill rates and in general more flexibility of interest rates, especially if credit demand strengthens domestically or interest rates rise further in the United States. The authorities indicated that they were committed to interest rate flexibility, including with respect to treasury bill rates. C. Exchange Market Policies 34. The issue of competitiveness was reviewed (including during Mr. Fischer’s visit to Cairo). The real effective exchange rate of the pound has appreciated substantially since the early 199Os, with the appreciation since the middle of the decade due largely to the strength of the U.S. dollar (Figure 3). While a large part of this appreciation was offset by the effects of debt relief and structural reform, the pound has become overvalued, especially with the continued appreciation of the U.S. dollar (Box 2). The need to limit the impact of tightened macroeconomic policies on growth in the period ahead raises the importance of adequate competitiveness. Possible approaches to addressing this issue were discussed and are being considered by the authorities. Regardless of any steps taken to tackle immediate competitiveness concerns, the staff suggested that greater flexibility in the exchange rate would be desirable both to accommodate needed further trade liberalization, and to help the Egyptian economy cope with any future turbulence in the international financial markets or sharp movements in the dollar against other currencies. While the pegged exchange rate is maintained, however, the foreign exchange market needs to be adequately supplied with liquidity, as shortages can undermine market confidence. The authorities indicated that they would seek to ensure that such shortages were avoided in the future. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- Box 2. Developments in Competitiveness A number of factors suggest that Egypt has suffered from a loss of competitiveness in recent years: Real exchange rate: between February 199 1 (when the exchange rate system was unified) and mid- 1995, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 29 percent, mostly on account of higher inflation relative to partner countries (Figure 1). This real appreciation, however, was probably largely offset by the impact on the equilibrium real exchange rate of the effect of(i) debt relief in the early 1990s and (ii) underlying productivity growth from the structural reforms of the early 1990s.’ Since mid-1995, the real effective exchange rate has appreciated by a further 37 percent. Although much of this subsequent real appreciation is due to the appreciation of the US dollar against European currencies during this time (over half of Egypt’s trade is with Europe), it will still have adversely affected Egypt’s competitiveness. Productivity growth and real wages: while there may have been some further productivity gains resulting from continued structural reforms in the second half of the decade, these are unlikely to be able to account for much of the real appreciation observed during this period. Staff estimates suggest that industrial sector labor productivity growth during 1995-97 may have been lower than during 1992-94. Productivity growth may also have fallen behind the growth of real wages during 1995-97. Export/GDP shares: since 1994195, when total exports of goods and nonfactor services (including tourism and the Suez Canal) stood at 2 1.8 percent of GDP, total exports have declined as a share of GDP to 15.2 percent (estimated) in 1999/00. Although broadly stable during this period, the share of nonoil exports of goods (mainly cotton, textiles, clothing, and agricultural products) in GDP is low, estimated at about 3.6 percent of GDP in 1999/00. Export market shares: between 1992 and 1994, Egypt’s share in its major export markets were generally stable. Since then, Egypt’s share of exports in the European Union market has virtually halved, while the share of exports in the United States market has fallen by a third. These two markets combined represent three quarters of Egypt’s exports. The share of exports in Middle Eastern markets has also fallen. Only in Asia has market share held up. Import demand: this has been constrained by a relatively high tariff structure, as well as by cumbersome import procedures and lately by the banks’ application of a 100 percent import cover scheme. ’ Productivity growth could generate a rise in the equilibrium (CPI-based) real exchange rate if it were concentrated in the traded goods sector (the Balassa effect). See Egypt: Beyond Stabilization, Toward a Dynamic Market Economy (IMF Occasional Paper No. 163, May 1998), Howard Handy et. al., for an analysis of the behavior of the equilibrium real exchange rate in Egypt during this period. This analysis suggests that the actual real exchange rate was close to equilibrium in mid- 1995.

MACROECONOMIC~UTLOOKFOR 2000/01 ANDTHEMEDIUM TERM 35. Economic growth is expected to slow somewhat further in 2000/01, assuming a continued moderate tightening of macroeconomic policies as discussed above (Appendix 1, Table 6). The slackening in the pace of economic activity is expected to be pronounced in construction and related industrial sectors, while growth in other sectors, especially hotels and tourism, is expected to remain relatively robust. Some general recovery is assumed to begin in the second half of 2000/01, on the assumption that the reinvigoration of reform planned by the authorities (see below) has a positive impact on investor confidence. On this basis, the staff has projected output growth of 4% percent on average in 2000/01. This projection is highly tentative, however, given the uncertainty about both the recent path of economic activity and the impact of reforms on investment. A more prolonged slowdown and lower growth in 2000/01 overall cannot be ruled out. With the weakening of growth, and assuming a continuation of the present exchange rate policy, inflation is expected to remain low. 36. The current account deficit is projected to be little changed in 2000/01 at about 1.9 percent of GDP (Appendix 1; Table 7). Both non-oil imports and exports of goods and services are expected to rise only moderately, reflecting lower domestic demand and weaker export prices respectively. The capital account is projected to strengthen in 2000/01, assuming rapid progress with implementation of the reform program especially privatization, and with the further tightening of macroeconomic policies discussed above. The reinvigoration of structural reform should help to improve market confidence and encourage foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows; it should also help underpin efforts on the part of the government to tap into the eurobond market (market borrowing on the order of US$l.2 billion in 2000/01 is assumed). On this basis, the staff estimates that the balance of payments would be in overall balance, allowing international reserves to stabilize at close to their current level. 37. Egypt’s medium-term prospects will depend on how fast the authorities pursue their reform agenda and on the sustained strengthening of macroeconomic policies. Particularly critical will be a further opening up of the economy through trade liberalization and continued progress with privatization. On the assumption of rapid progress with structural reform, economic growth is tentatively projected to recover from the slowdown expected for 1999/00 and 2000/l towards 5l% percent per annum by the end of the five-year horizon. This is expected, even with further fiscal consolidation,17 to lead to a widening of the current account deficit from slightly under 2 percent of GDP to about 3 percent of GDP. In the longer term, the external position should benefit from the development of Egypt’s natural gas reserves, but these are not expected to come on stream until mid-2005 at the earliest (see Box 3). For the next five years, the projected current account deficit would be I7 The fiscal balance is projected to decline toward 2 percent of GDP. The consolidated balance should move into surplus under this scenario. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - consistent with a stable level of external reserves, provided that Egypt is successful in attracting portfolio and direct investments from abroad, and/or tapping international capital markets. In the staffs view, in addition to the sensitivity of the outlook to the pace of reform, there are significant downside risks to this medium-term scenario, including: (a) the possibility that the import elasticity will turn out to be higher than unity as assumed; (b) that the further increases in domestic saving needed to keep the current account in check may be difficult to achieve; and (c) the concerns about competitiveness mentioned above, especially given the need for further trade liberalization. The authorities noted these risks, but nevertheless felt that somewhat faster pace of economic growth should be sustainable on the basis of the reform program that they envisage. Box 3: Recent Developments in the Energy Sector Traditionally oil has been the mainstay of the energy sector in Egypt, but as oil reserves have fallen to a little over 3 billion barrels and production has fallen (from over 900,000 barrels a day (bpd), in 1996 to about 750,000 bpd in 1999) oil’s importance has been declining. Recent discoveries of crude are expected to do no more than stabilize production at current levels, with production from new wells compensating for the declining production from old wells. With increasing domestic consumption more than keeping pace with production, the oil sector has now ceased to be a net earner of foreign exchange for Egypt. Attention has now shifted to natural gas, where significant reserves have recently been found, mainly in the offshore Nile Delta basin, but also in the Western Desert. Proven gas reserves now stand in excess of 1 trillion cubic meters (cm) compared with 425 billion cm in 1993. Production is expected to almost double from its present 45 million cm per day by 2002 and to increase further in subsequent years. By mid-2005, the earliest it is expected that exports will come on stream, there should be a surplus of some 28 million cm per day for export, taking into account domestic consumption which is growing at 6- 8 percent per year. If Egypt is successful in exporting this entire potential surplus it could generate additional revenue of nearly US$O.8 billion per year. Egypt is in advanced negotiations with Turkey, Israel and Jordan on long-term export contracts (contracts typically last for around 20 years). VI. STRUCTURALREFORMS A. Privatization 38. The authorities indicated that they plan to divest most of the remaining public enterprises within the next two years. One of the more significant steps expected during 2000/l is the flotation of a portion (1 O-20 percent) of Egypt Telecom, which would be the largest privatization transaction to date. Cabinet has approved the corporatization of the - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - electricity authority as a first step towards its privatization. The privatization of the gas distribution network has also been approved and will be undertaken in the near future. In the financial sector, the privatization of the public sector’s share of joint venture insurance companies is underway, while procedures relating to the privatization of the state insurance companies will be expedited following the valuation of their assets. The staff welcomed the authorities’ plans, and encouraged them to move forward with privatization of the large public sector banks, which had been delayed. The authorities noted that the share of state- owned banks in the banking system had fallen to about 50 percent, and that their privatization, while still on the agenda, was not a priority given the importance of moving ahead in other key sectors. B. Fiscal Reform 39. The government is in the process of formulating a promising strategy to reinvigorate the process of fiscal reform. As regards the tax system, the authorities indicated that the income tax structure is being reviewed with the objective of rationalizing tax rates and exemptions in all sectors and that they plan to proceed with the long-awaited implementation of the second and third stages of the GST and intend to improve the administration of customs and to rationalize tariff rates. The mission welcomed the authorities’ reform plans and indicated that the IMF is ready to provide technical assistance in these areas.” The authorities are also seeking to improve tax administration and intend to introduce reforms to training, infrastructure and equipment. Strengthening tax enforcement is also a priority, as is-in the longer term-bringing the informal sector into the tax net. This package of reforms is aimed at arresting the trend decline in tax revenue to GDP and thus to strengthen the fiscal position in the medium term. 40. The staff also discussed with the authorities a number of institutional weaknesses in the management of aspects of the budget, mainly regarding investment, identified during the review of the fiscal data. The main problems are that: (i) responsibility for the execution of the investment budget is vested in the Ministry of Planning rather than the Ministry of Finance; (ii) the Ministry of Planning is empowered to increase/reallocate funds for investment spending without seeking further parliamentary authority to do so; and (iii) the NIB can issue debt and engage in extensive extrabudgetary activities without the authority of the Ministry of Finance. Problems of budgetary control also arise because neither privatization proceeds or external grants are fully consolidated with the budget. 41. The staff suggested a number of institutional reforms to address these problems, including: (i) bringing the NIB fully under the control of the Ministry of Finance; (ii) establishing the Ministry of Finance as the sole entity authorized to issue debt; 18FAD and USAID have provided extensive technical assistance on tax reform. A mission is scheduled to visit Cairo shortly to assist the authorities in finalizing their tax reform package. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - (iii) creating an integrated ledger covering both recurrent and investment expenditure to strengthen control over aggregate government spending; and (iv) channeling all external grants and privatization proceeds through the budget, reflecting their use transparently in the fiscal accounts. The staff also recommended that the legal framework for budget management be strengthened through the establishment of a comprehensive and modem budget law. Such a law could institutionalize measures to strengthen the control of the Ministry of Finance over public finances and enhance parliamentary oversight of the budgetary process. The staff offered the authorities technical assistance in undertaking these reforms. The authorities have formed a joint committee of the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Planning to review issues related to pubic investment and role of the NIB, and will consider the staffs recommendations in light of the findings of the committee. Pending more fundamental reforms, the authorities indicated that steps would be taken quickly to strengthen monitoring of and control over investment. The authorities also indicated that they intend to undertake a number of reforms to improve debt management and improve the efficiency of expenditure. C. Financial Sector Issues 42. In many respects, Egypt’s prudential standards are in conformity with international standards. Capital adequacy requirements are set at 8 percent of risk weighted assets, which is equal to the minimum established by the Basle Committee (although on the low side for developing countries which, as a rule, face greater risks). The methods used to assess compliance with capital adequacy r’equirements are also broadly in line with the standards established by the Base1 Committee. Regulations regarding loan classification and provisioning are in line with international standards. Limits on open foreign exchange positions also mirror established international practice (open positions in any one currency are limited to 10 percent of capital and in all currencies to 20 percent). 43. Most hanks in Egypt are in compliance with prudential standards (Appendix 1, Table 8). Average bank capital adequacy ratios are about 2 percentage points above the minimum required. Nonperforming loans have risen only slightly as share of total portfolios (but more rapidly relative to GDP). The staff observed, however, that rapid credit growth of the kind seen in Egypt in recent years has in other cases been associated with a decline in lending standards and that banks may therefore be vulnerable to a deceleration in economic activity. 44. A further strengthening of regulation and supervision needs to be accorded priority in these circumstances. After reviewing existing procedures, the staff team made recommendations for improvements to regulatory requirements and practices. Reflecting the risks associated with lending in developing countries, it was recommended that the minimum capital adequacy ratio be raised from 8 to 10 percent of risk-weighted assets. Other recommendations included tightening regulations on large exposures and connected lending, increasing the independence of supervisors, strengthening on-site supervision on public banks, taking corrective action against the (mostly smaller) banks not in compliance with prudential regulations, and obliging banks to publicly disclose nonperforming loans. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - The staff also encouraged participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program. The authorities are considering these recommendations and discussions with the staff are continuing. 45. The authorities indicated that they were taking steps to improve the functioning of financial markets, with a view, inter alia, to improving the effectiveness of monetary policy. In the treasury bill market, for example, a book entry system will be operational shortly, and the adoption of a primary dealer system is under consideration. These changes are expected to stimulate secondary market trading in treasury bills and bonds, which is at present limited. Work is meanwhile underway to deepen the interbank market and to develop a reference interest rate (Cairo Interbank Offer Rate, or CIBOR). Payments system modemization is also underway, with a new system expected to be operational by June 200 1. D. Trade Liberalization 46. Further trade liberalization is crucial for sustaining the momentum of economic growth, especially in view of the weak performance of the export sector. The staff observed that Egypt has a tariff regime with a relatively high average tariff as well as a wide dispersion of rates, and encouraged the authorities to formulate a strategy for moving towards a much lower and more uniform tariff structure. l9 The authorities noted that tariffs are being lowered in the context of a number of bilateral and regional trade agreements and discussions are advanced on an association arrangement with the EU. The staff welcomed these steps, but emphasized the importance of multilateral tariff reduction for securing the benefits from trade liberalization. 47. Efforts continue to further streamline the regulatory environment and expedite customs clearance. Quality controls are in the process of being harmonized with international standards, and applied to the domestic market as well as to imported goods, and repeat importers who have established track records of meeting quality and customs regulations are beginning to be given access to accelerated procedures. At the same time, the authorities intend to reform customs administration, which should simplify, speed up and clarify customs clearance procedures. I9 Egypt’s (simple) average tariff is 26.8 percent, with tariffs for most goods ranging from zero to 40 percent (see the background paper for details). There are also a number of import surcharges, which would raise the average tariff to 30.2 percent. While a large number of exemptions reduce the effective tariff rate (estimated at about 15 percent, calculated as the ratio of customs revenue to imports), they add to the complexity and administrative cost of the trade regime. On the IMF’s index of trade restrictiveness, Egypt scores a high “8”. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - E. Legal Reform and Deregulation 48. Since the last consultation, the authorities have put in place a number of changes to the legal and regulatory framework, including allowing corporations to issue bonds and other capital markets guidelines. Looking forward, they intend to push ahead with draft legislation that has been in the pipeline for a while in a number of areas, although significant progress is likely to be made only after the parliamentary elections this November. Their legislative package covers the following areas: (i) banks and financial institutions; (ii) CBE independence; (iii) capital markets law; (iv) a clearing and settlement system; (v) a unified corporate law; (vi) changes in the banking code to facilitate mortgage lending (vii) securitization (leasing); (viii) changes in the investment law, to facilitate business expansion; and (ix) economic zones, which provide investment incentives (e.g., lower customs duties, flat capital income tax rate, flexibility in hiring/firing of labor). The authorities have also drafted a new labor law that they believe would be more supportive of market reforms. In addition, a draft mortgage law is before Parliament, but discussion is expected to be delayed after the November elections. F. Poverty Alleviation 49. The basic pattern of poverty in Egypt has remained broadly unchanged since the last consultation, although there is some evidence that social indicators are improving-e.g., per capita GDP, literacy rates, access to electricity, and infant mortality. To help alleviate poverty, the Social Fund for Development (SFD) is undertaking a number of new initiatives, including: (i) a new drive to create employment and the creation of a new Small Enterprise Development Organization (SEDO) to foster employment creation in the private sector, and (ii) a plan to provide a safety net for the destitute (a monthly benefit of LESO-LElOO for some 1 million destitute families). G. Data Issues 50. The ongoing review of budget and related data has revealed weaknesses in the coverage of, and procedures for compiling, fiscal data, as noted above. The authorities are aware of these problems, and as part of the process of addressing them have instructed that the NIB be subject to a comprehensive audit, with the assistance of an internationally recognized accounting firm. The staff supported this intention, noting that it would be important for the audit to be carried out as expeditiously as possible. The staff felt that it was important for the discrepancies in the fiscal data for 1997198 and earlier years to be reconciled and the data revised as necessary as quickly as possible. The authorities indicated, however, that this could not be done reliably until the audit of the NIB had been completed. The staff recommended that a number of other steps to improve the quality of the fiscal data and their transparency be urgently taken, including: (i) participation in the fiscal module of the IMF’s Report on Standards and Codes; and (ii) an IMF technical assistance mission to propose revisions to the reporting formats for fiscal data (including their institutional coverage), with the aim of providing a more comprehensive picture of fiscal activity, and meeting the government’s own administrative needs more effectively.

In the external sector, the authorities were encouraged to continue taking steps to strengthen customs data on external trade, so that these can be used as the main source for estimating trade flows. Historically, banking system and customs data have given inconsistent results (lately, with respect to export performance), and their divergence makes it difficult to interpret recent external developments. The authorities also indicated that they were looking into the significant discrepancies between the data compiled (from debtors) by the CBE and the data compiled (from creditors) by the BIS on short-term external debt. 52. The authorities are concerned that there are inadequate indicators of recent developments in the real economy, which hinders macroeconomic policy formulation. National account data are available only with a four to five month lag, and in the absence of more up-to-date indicators, such as monthly figures for industrial production or retail sales, it is difficult to form a reliable impression of more recent developments. The authorities have requested and STA has agreed to provide technical assistance in developing such indicators. VII. STAFFAPPRAISAL 53. Following generally strong economic performance during most of the 199Os, less favorable trends have recently emerged. In particular, the external position has weakened and international reserves have been declining. Although a more difficult external environment contributed to these developments in 1997-98, macroeconomic policies have also played an important part. Rapid credit growth has put pressure on the balance of payments, while revisions to fiscal data indicate that public investment and the fiscal deficit in 1998/99 and 1999/00 were substantially higher than earlier believed. (Uncertainty about the fiscal data for earlier years, however, has made the role of fiscal policy difficult to assess). In addition, the pace of structural reform slackened after mid-1998. These developments, including the weak performance of the export sector, raise questions about the quality and durability of the rapid economic growth in the late 1990s. 54. The authorities have begun to strengthen macroeconomic policies and reinvigorate structural reform. Credit growth has been reduced significantly since mid- 1999, while steps are being taken to reduce investment spending and cut the fiscal deficit. On the structural front, the pace of privatization has picked up and plans are being formulated for important tax and other reforms. With the tightening of macroeconomic policies, the reserve loss has slowed, but there are also indications that output growth is weakening. 55. The immediate task facing the authorities is to consolidate the stabilization of international reserves, while limiting the slowdown in economic activity. The authorities and staff are in agreement that a combination of further moderate restraint over macroeconomic policies combined with sustained implementation of a revitalized and comprehensive reform program is the only viable strategy. Even then, a period of slow growth may not be avoidable, as a relatively quick rebound will require an early upswing in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - investor confidence. The authorities’ recent announcement of the revisions to the fiscal data and of their policy program for reducing the fiscal deficit and strengthening economic reform is, however, certainly an important step toward achieving a soft landing. 56. Over the medium term, maintaining progress with structural reform will be crucial for ensuring that Egypt fulfills its potential for rapid economic growth. Particularly important will be substantial additional trade liberalization supported by improvements in competitiveness. Continued progress with privatization and the strengthening and development of the financial sector also have key roles to play. 57. Further fiscal adjustment is essential for ensuring macroeconomic stability. The authorities’ intention to steadily reduce the fiscal deficit is therefore welcome. The staff believes, however, that a somewhat larger cut in the fiscal deficit in 2000/O 1, to perhaps about 3 percent of GDP, would be desirable to restore confidence in fiscal management. But the staff would not argue for a larger cut in view of the need to avoid undue contractionary effects on output, and given that a broader definition of the fiscal balance, which includes the pension funds, is in a much stronger position. The additional adjustment should come through steps to reverse the declining trend in government savings, focussing on containing the wage bill and strengthening non-oil domestic revenue. 58. Credit growth needs to be further slowed. A reduction in the growth of credit to the nongovernment sector to perhaps about 1 l-12 percent by mid-2001 is estimated to be consistent with stabilization of international reserves at close to their current level, given the authorities’ plans for fiscal consolidation. While lower than in recent years, this rate of credit expansion should still be consistent with quite robust economic growth. This monetary scenario is inevitably highly uncertain, however; in particular, policy may need to be tighter if money demand turns out to be weaker than projected. Maintaining firm monetary control may require increases in interest rates, especially if credit demand strengthens or interest rates rise further in the United States. It is therefore important that the CBE’s commitment to interest rate flexibility, including on treasury bills, be translated into practice. 59. The real effective exchange rate of the pound appreciated substantially during the 199Os, with the appreciation largely the result of the strength of the dollar since the middle of the decade. While the appreciation of the pound has been partly offset by the effects of debt reduction and structural reform, there has almost certainly been a significant loss in competitiveness in recent years. This has been reflected in a decline in market shares in most regions and a fall in the ratio of exports of goods and services to GDP. The slowdown in growth in prospect adds to the importance of addressing competitiveness concerns. Regardless of how this immediate competitiveness issue is tackled, there would be considerable advantage in moving to a more flexible exchange rate regime, as this would help the economy cope with any future turbulence in international markets and adapt to needed further trade liberalization. So long as the pegged exchange rate regime is maintained, however, the foreign exchange market needs to be supplied with adequate liquidity.

While progress has been made in strengthening banking supervision and regulation in recent years, scope for further improvement remains. The authorities should, in particular, strengthen onsite supervision, especially for the large public sector banks. Attention to further improving financial system supervision and regulation is especially important now, as experience in other countries suggests that periods of rapid credit creation often create underlying weaknesses in the banking system that only come to light when economic growth slows and the overall economic situation weakens. For this reason, the authorities are also strongly encouraged to participate in the Financial Sector Assessment Program. 61. The government’s plan to divest most of its remaining portfolio of companies in the next two years is commendable. Moving ahead rapidly with privatization has the potential to revitalize the investment climate and help maintain the momentum of growth. The envisaged privatization of part of Egypt Telecom would be a particularly important step. Privatization of state-owned banks, which has been delayed, is not planned in the near term, and the authorities are encouraged to give this higher priority. 62. Further progress with trade liberalization is essential for sustaining rapid development over the medium term. A number of welcome steps in this direction have recently been taken or are planned, including actions to streamline customs clearance procedures. Also, tariffs are being lowered in the context of a number of regional and bilateral trade agreements, and discussions are well advanced on an association arrangement with the EU. However, Egypt still has a relatively high tariff rate and quite wide tariff dispersion, and a moving towards a lower and more uniform tariff structure should be a priority. As the economy is virtually free of restrictions on current (and capital) transactions, the authorities are strongly encouraged to accept the obligations of Article VIII. 63. The government is formulating promising plans for tax reform. These include rationalization of the income tax structure, improvements in tax and customs administration, including with a view to bringing the informal economy into the tax net, and extension of the GST to the wholesale and retail stages. Given the slow progress in this area in the past, the staff strongly supports the effort to reinvigorate this reform agenda. These reforms have the potential to arrest the decline in revenues in relation to GDP. The staff has agreed a program of technical assistance to help in these areas. 64. Recent revisions to the fiscal data are of considerable concern and have highlighted institutional problems in the execution and monitoring of aspects of the budget related to investment expenditure. Reforms are urgently needed to improve control over public investment, including: (i) bringing the activities of the NIB related to public investment under the control of the Ministry of Finance-pending this fundamental reform, interim steps are needed to improve the control and monitoring of the operations of the NIB; (ii) the consolidation of authority for the issuance of all debt, including that currently issued by the NIB, to the Ministry of Finance; and (iii) the channeling of all privatization proceeds through the budget. It is also recommended that the legal framework for the budget be Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30- strengthened, and the suggested reforms institutionalized, through the establishment of a new budget system law. 65. Progress has been made in revising and reconciling the fiscal data, although further work needs to done. With the upward revision to the budget deficit for 1998/99 the financing and debt data for that year now broadly reconcile (although some elements remain to be clarified). Sizeable discrepancies between financing and debt data for earlier years still exist, and high priority should be given to reconciling these. The intention of the authorities to conduct a thorough audit of the NIB with the assistance of an internationally recognized accounting firm is welcomed. This should be carried out expeditiously. The staff also strongly recommends a number of other steps be urgently taken to improve data quality, including: participation in the fiscal module of the Report on Standards and Codes; and a thorough review, with IMF technical assistance, of the formats in which fiscal data are currently reported, with a view to providing a more comprehensive and useful picture of fiscal activity. 66. There is also scope for improvements in the quality, timeliness, and comprehensiveness of data reporting in other areas, including the national accounts, real economy indicators, and external trade. The authorities are encouraged to strengthen the statistics in these areas as well as the fiscal. data, so that policy formulation in Egypt and surveillance by the Fund can be conducted on a sounder footing in the future. 67. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard 12-month cycle.

XII. Cairo Center for Economic Information In mid-1999, the Egyptian authorities established the Cairo Center for Economic Information to provide timely information on recent economic developments and promote a wider understanding of the elements and implications of sound economic policy. The focus of the seminars, workshops, and similar activities will be the economic and financial media, academic and parliamentary communities, and other economic interest groups (labor leaders, etc.) From an initial domestic base, it is intended that the Center’s activities will expand to cover similar key groups in other MENA countries. The Fund is supporting the activities of the Center, including through the provision of resource materials (notably Arabic language documents) and presentations by Fund staff (including the resident representative) at the Center’s seminars and workshops.

The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for Egypt for the period 1997-99 was reviewed by the Board on May 29, 1997. In view of Egypt’s goal of reducing unemployment and raising living standards, the following four areas were identified for greater Bank Group involvement: (i) export development; (ii) private sector-led growth; (iii) development of human resources; and (iv) natural resource management. In support of these objectives, the Bank Group will provide a range of financial instruments (loans, credits, guarantees, etc.), and assistance in aid coordination and economic policy advice on key issues. The Bank chaired a Consultative Group meeting for Egypt on February 11,1999. 2. As of June 30,2000, the World Bank had approved 112 loans and credits (total principal US$6.4 billion) to Egypt (some of them for the same project), of which US$4.7 billion has been disbursed. Roughly one-half of commitments for ongoing operations support agriculture and rural development and one-half support human resource development. During FY99, the World Bank has approved loans for Sohag Rural Development (US$25 million), Secondary Education (USSSO million), Social Fund (US$50 million), Private Sector and Agricultural Development (US$300 million), and Pumping Stations Rehabilitation (USS 120 million). Egypt’s eligibility for IDA credits ended in FY99. 3. IFC investments (including approved investments pending commitment) totaled US$334 million as of August 3 1, 1999, of which US$139 million had been disbursed. There have been no MIGA guarantees.

Estimates are compiled annually by the Ministry of Planning, on a fiscal year basis, in current and constant prices. The multisector statistics in February 1999 found that progress is being made with the USAID project for improving national accounts statistics, but that much work still needs to be done. As part of the implementation phase of the project, a training program has begun and a new computer system is being developed. However, while some experimental quarterly national accounts estimates are being prepared, these estimates need to be produced on a discrete basis and be disseminated to appropriate users in the government and to the IMF for comment. Reliable indicators of economic activity are also lacking. The authorities have requested Fund technical assistance for setting up such a system. The shortcomings in the fiscal account hamper analysis of developments in the national income accounts. There are delays in compiling national accounts data. 2. Price and empzoyment statistics. The CPI weights were revised in July 1998 to eliminate a calculation error identified by a February 1997 STA mission.’ Comparable efforts are required to revise the producer price index and improve the external trade price indices (the latter are unreliable and available only annually). Data on employment are available with a lag. 3. BaZance of Payments (BOP) statistics. The BOP statistics have been revised with Fund technical assistance in accordance with the Fifth Edition in methods and coverage of BOP statistics compiled by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and in reporting of data to the Fund. However, data coverage and classification seem to have recently deteriorated, as evidenced by the sharp increase in net errors and omissions. With foreign exchange liberalization, banks do not get full details of transactions either from the customers or from the overseas correspondents. Early measures are required and the February 1999 STA mission suggested that the CBE explore using trade statistics compiled by Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) in cooperation with customs Administration. 4. InternationaZ investment position data. Comprehensive data are compiled on public- and publicly-guaranteed external debt through a mandatory reporting system. However, reporting on, nonguaranteed debt is voluntary and incomplete. The authorities are drawing on advice from Fund staff and other outside advisers on forming a strategy to strengthen the reporting system. ‘The revised series shows a slightly higher increase in prices-O.7 percent over a 12-month period. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-46- APPENDIX IV 5. FiscaZ data. There is a question now as to whether the fiscal data provided by the authorities are adequate for surveillance and the transparency of the fiscal data provided needs to be improved significantly. The key issue is the apparent discrepancy between data on government financing and on government debt. The estimate of the fiscal deficit for 1998/99 was revised by the Ministry of Finance in February, partly to address such concerns, however, there remain gaps in the staffs understanding of public finances in this year. Earlier years, for which discrepancies between debt and financing data also exist, have not been revised. Moreover, data on the financing of public investment expenditures remain incomplete, the fiscal data do not include in-kind military assistance, nor do they reflect arrears owed by, and to the government. Egypt does not report fiscal data for publication in IFS; annual data in IFS are obtained from the GFS Yearbook. 6. Monetary statistics. The statistics are comprehensive and reported regularly.
