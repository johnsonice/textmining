The output decline appears to be bottoming out, however, and growth may be within reach. l The authorities have been implementing sound financial policies. The fiscal adjustment achieved in 1999 and 2000 has been impressive and unprecedented, reducing the overall commitments budget deficit from over 10 percent of GDP in 1998 to less than 3 percent of GDP in 2000. Monetary policy was tightened in 2000; inflation resumed its downward trend and is expected to reach 20 percent by end- December 2000. l Discussions focused on policies that would help Moldova achieve sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty, and reduce the country’s external debt burden. Key to achieving these goals would be the continuation of sound financial policies and an acceleration in implementing structural reforms. The authorities have developed an ambitious reform program, with strong prior actions, and request the support from the Fund through an arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). l The authorities have emphasized poverty reduction in their program, given the sharp reduction in living standards in the past decade. Policies will not only aim at restoring growth, but also at improving social assistance and human development. The authorities have prepared an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, providing information on the country’s poverty profile and outlining the government’s strategy for preparing a comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy. a The structural reform agenda is long and there is a need to prioritize. As many areas of reform will be captured by World Bank adjustment lending operations, the PRGF program focuses on a limited number of structural measures that are critical to the program’s objectives. l Even with strong financial policies and a resumption of growth, Moldova’s external debt outlook remains precarious; the country is likely to face liquidity problems in 2002-03. The debt situation could be more problematic should the recovery take longer to materialize. Concessional foreign financial assistance will be crucial over the medium term. A Consultative Group meeting is being prepared. l Access under the new arrangement, as proposed in this paper, would be SDR 110 million, or 90 percent of quota, to be disbursed in quarterly installments over three years.

Discussions for the 2000 Article IV consultation and a new arrangement with the Fund that could be supported under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were held in Chiinu during July 12-26,200O and October 16-30,200O.’ The mission met with President Lucinschi, Prime Minister Braghis, Speaker of Parliament Diacov, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Reforms Cucu, National Bank of Moldova (NBM) Governor Talmaci, Minister of Finance Manoli and other senior government officials and members of parliament, as well as representatives of NGOs. 2. The 1999 Article- IV consultation was concluded on August 6, 1999, when the fourth review under the EFF arrangement was also completed (EBS/99/142 and %4/99/l 95). On that occasion, Executive Directors stressed that high priority should be placed on consolidating the fiscal stance, which had been tightened significantly compared to 1998, and on accelerating structural reforms aimed at both the resumption of economic growth and improving the ability to withstand external shocks. 3. The fifth review under the EFF could not be completed before the arrangement expired on May 19,2000,’ as parliament twice rejected legislation that would allow the privatization of the economically important wineries and tobacco companies (a prior action for the completion of the review and also a condition for further World Bank disbursements). This left SDR 47.5 million of the SDR 135 million available under the arrangement undisbursed. 4. Moldova accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3 and 4 in June 1995, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Moldova’s relations with the Fund, the World Bank Group and the EBRD are summarized in Appendices I-III. The quality and timeliness of Moldova’s statistical data, although adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, continue to suffer from weaknesses, especially in the real sector (Appendix IV). ’ The staff team consisted of Messrs. Haas (head), van Rooden, Ms. ten Berge, Ms. Dolinskaya (EP; July) (all EU2), Mr. Baldacci (FAD), Mr. Chauffour (July) and Ms. Tumbarello (October) (both PDR), Ms. Rendak (LEG; October), and Mr, Pivovarov (BLS). Mr. Odling-Smee visited Chiinu during October 23-25,200O. Mr. Al-Au-ash, the resident representative, also participated in the work of the mission. Ms. Hoffman (July) and Mr. Davis (October) of the World Bank participated in the discussions. 2 A three-year EFF arrangement for Moldova in the amount of SDR 135 million (150 percent of old quota) was approved by the Executive Board on May 20, 1996 (EBS/96/68), and was extended for a year by the Board on January 4, 1999 at the time of the third review (EBS/98/226). On March 23, 1999, Moldova was made ESAF eligible (EBS/99/43). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- II. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE EFF ARRANGEMENT 5. At the start of the EFF program in 1996, Moldova was generally viewed as just behind the Baltic countries in terms of progress iu transition, largely as a result of good progress in financial stabilization. However, since then output has been declining almost continuously and per capita income has fallen sharply to around US$350, making Moldova one of the pqorest countries in the region. 6. The poor econo@c performance can be attributed partially to external shocks but also to extended delays in, and the partial nature of, the implementation of structural reforms. The privatization of Moldova’s key economic sectors, notably agro- processing, has yet to be accomplished and many state-owned enterprises have not been operating with due regard to commercial considerations. In addition, the country’s institutional framework is still far removed from what is required for a well-functioning market economy. This has contributed to very low levels of foreign investment and private sector activity. Corruption has further damaged Moldova’s ability to attract strategic investors. 7. The lack of restructuring in the country’s main economic sectors also made Moldova more vulnerable to external shocks. With Russia and other CIS countries still being its main export markets, Moldova was hit very hard by the Russian crisis of August 1998. Exports in 1999 were about half of their 1997 level. 8. Furthermore, the failure to sufficiently contain fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits in the years prior to 1999, combined with easy external financing, has led to a sharp build- up of external debt. Debt indicators deteriorated f%rther due to the sharp depreciation of the domestic currency following the Russian crisis and the drop in output. At end-1999, public and publicly-guaranteed external debt amounted to over 70 percent of GDP. Adding arrears on energy imports puts the debt stock at over 100 percent of GDP. The debt burden presses particularly hard on the budget; in 1999, external debt-service obligations alone amounted to 80 percent of central government revenues. 9. The domestic political setting has hampered the transition process in general and program implementation in particular, with recurrent periods of political uncertainty and a lack of cooperation between the presidency and parliament. Ownership of the Fund supported program was weak at the highest levels of government until early 1999; since then more reform-oriented governments have been in power. 10. The program’s emphasis on structural conditionality increased markedly in 1998, recognizing that the lack of sufficient progress in implementing structural reforms threatened to undercut the financial stabilization achieved early on. The continuing stop-go nature of the structural reform process, however, combined with the recurrent periods of political uncertainty, caused repeated delays in completing program reviews.

On the other hand, considerable progress in macroeconomic stabilization continued to be made under the EFF program. Inflation remained at relatively low levels, except for a temporary pick-up in 1999, reflecting the emergence of a strong and independent central bank, one of the more successful in transition economies. In addition, an impressive and unprecedented fiscal adjustment was finally undertaken in 1999 (see below). On the external side, current international transactions remained free of restrictions, even at the height of the Russian crisis. III. RECENTPOLJTICALANDECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS 12. A major political development has been the adoption by parliament in July 2000 of two amendments to the constitution; the first made Moldova a parliamentary republic, the second strengthened the powers of the government relative to both the presidency and parliament. The president vetoed the bills but parliament overrode the veto by an overwhelming majority and the laws were promulgated on July 28,200O. 13. The first amendment means that the next president will be elected by parliament in early December 2000. This effectively replaced the direct presidential elections previously scheduled for late 2000. Moreover, the presidency will have more a symbolic function. This change should end the power struggle between the presidency and parliament, which at times has stood in the way of the reform process. It remains to be seen, however, whether differences between parliamentary factions (none of which has a majority) replace this power struggle as a major political impediment to economic reforms. 14. Parliament has yet to agree on the precise additional powers it will bestow on the government, but it is expected that the government would obtain greater authority to handle economic matters. 15. The economic situation remained diffkult in 1999 and 2000. Moldova was hit hard by the Russian crisis of 1998 and real GDP continued to decline in 1999, by 4.4 percent (Table 1 and Figure 1). Economic activity stat-ted to show signs of a recovery in early 2000, reflecting a gradual improvement in the external environment and the impact of sound financial policies, but again the economy faced external shocks: a drought and increasing energy prices. While industrial output has started to increase, agricultural production continued to fall in 2000. On balance, real GDP is expected to remain flat in 2000 or grow marginally at most. 16. Inflation performance has been mixed. Inflation accelerated in 1999 to 44 percent (end-year), reflecting the impact of the sharp depreciation of the leu in the aftermath of the Russian crisis, but also an easing of monetary policy (Table 2). Monetary policy in 1999 faced the difficult task of finding the right balance between containing inflation and restoring confidence in the leu versus accommodating the large external shock to minimize the output loss. This task was further complicated by the recurrent domestic political tensions, as well as a-not unrelated-significant shortfall in foreign financing of the budget.

Monetary policy was successtilly tightened, however, in early 2000 and cumulative inflation in the first nine months of the year was 1% percent Inflation for 2000 as a whole (year-end) is expected to be about 20 percent. 17. Fiscal policy developments in 1999 were both impressive and unprecedented. The commitments deficit of the consolidated general government (excluding project financing) was reduced by 6 percent of GDP relative to 1998, to 2.6 percent of GDP in 1999 (or a deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP including project financing) (Tables 3 and 4; Figure 2).3 Underlying the fiscal tightening was a reduction of expenditures by nearly 11 percent of GDP (on a commitments basis) relative to 1998. This curtailing of expenditures was achieved through a rationalization of energy consumption by budgetary institutions and, after years of delay, major efforts to eliminate excess capacity in the relatively large health and education sectors. This included closing underutilized hospitals, increasing class sizes, and reducing employment in the health and education sectors.4 A partial hiring freeze was introduced, allowing the replacement of only one of each two civil servants that leave or retire. Public sector wages and salaries, which had last been raised in 1995, remained Cozen in nominal terms in 1999. The rationalization of social spending brought Moldova’s share in GDP of public outlays on health and education more in line with those in other countries, including transition economies, with similar levels of per capita income. 18. The fiscal retrenchment was consolidated in 2000. With no foreign financing, the commitments deficit was less than one half of a percent of GDP (annualized) in the first nine months of 2000. On a cash basis, the deficit was slightly over 1 percent of GDP, as the government succeeded in reducing the stock of expenditure arrears (mostly wage and 3 Unless noted otherwise, deficit figures mentioned in this and accompanying documents exclude foreign financed project loan disbursements. The rationale for this is twofold: the figures excluding project financing give a clearer picture of the fiscal adjustment, and (ii) the authorities’ official budget does not include project loan disbursements. Debt service associated with these loans as well as counterpart f%nds provided by the government are included in these figures. To assist assessment of the overall stance of fiscal policy and, notably, the impact on the debt outlook, the tables also present data including project loans. The staff has urged the authorities in the future to include project financing in the official budget. 4 With nearly 300 hospitals, there was a considerable overcapacity in the health care system. Also, with an average of 4 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants, Moldova was well above the average for transition countries as well as industrial countries.

The elimination of generous ill-targeted energy privileges in April 2000 and the adoption of the Law on Nominal Compensations, which provides for a better targeted social assistance system funded directly from the budget, constituted a major accomplishment in rationalizing the social safety net, benefiting the most needy. 19. In 1999, Moldova experienced a dramatic adjustment of its external imbalances. The external current account shrunk from US$323 million (almost 17 percent of GDP) in 1998 to an estimated US$34 million (2% percent of GDP) in 1999 (Table 5). This adjustment involved a sharp decline of both exports (by 27 percent) and imports (by 42 percent), reflecting, among other factors, the collapse of Moldova’s traditional export markets (exports to Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus contracted by 45 percent), the real depreciation of the leu, and the large fiscal adjustment. In 2000, the trade deficit widened again, as imports started to increase with a recovery of incomes and a real appreciation of the leu, while exports still remained close to the previous year’s level due to the impact of the drought on the main export crops. Rising worker remittances partly offset the growing trade deficit; the current account deficit is expected to be close to 8 percent of GDP in 2000. 20. Arrears on external public debt and guarantees were cleared in 2000. At end- 1999, the outstanding arrears on public debt and guarantees amounted to US$97.3 million (7% percent of GDP), of which US$89.2 million represented arrears on debt-service obligations to Russia (including a credit from Oneximbank). The arrears to Russia were cleared in April 2000 when an agreement on a rescheduling of these claims was reached. The remainder of these arrears, mostly on government guarantees, was cleared through a rescheduling agreement reached with German creditors and through payment of the amounts due to the EBRD. 21. Similarly, energy arrears were reduced in 2000. Notwithstanding the sharp contraction of imports, notably energy imports, Moldova had continued to accumulate large external payment arrears on energy in 1999. Arrears of state-owned energy enterprises on imported energy supplies (gas, electricity, and oil) increased by US$9 1 million to reach an 5 General government wage and pension arrears were estimated at Mdl 502 million at end- 1999 and were reduced to Md1283 million by end-September 2000. 6 The relative decline in tax revenues was concentrated in foreign trade taxes, social fund contributions, and other taxes.

In 2000, the outstanding arrears on energy imports of these companies were reduced by US$137 million as a result of the transfer of shares in Moldovagas to Gazprom (valued at US$47 million) and the issuance of US$90 million in promissory notes to Gazprom. Payment for energy imports also improved dramatically in the first three quarters of 2000, with close to 90 percent of the amounts due settled. By end-September 2000, the stock of energy arrears of the state-owned energy companies was estimated at about US$143 million. IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS A. Main Policy Objectives and Overall Approach 22. Discussions focused on policies that would help Moldova to achieve sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty, and reduce the country’s external debt burden. For a small, open economy as Moldova, that has no energy resources of its own, this will require strengthening the export sector and promoting greater efficiency in the use of energy. 23. The authorities shared the staffs view that key to achieving these goals would be an increase in investment, particularly by strategic foreign investors. Stimulating investment will require continued macroeconomic stability, as well as improvements in governance and the overall business climate, including the privatization of enterprises in Moldova’s main productive sectors and the creation of a legal framework appropriate for a market economy. 24. The authorities acknowledged that the lack of a sufficient and continuous momentum in implementing structural reforms had prevented the resumption of economic growth, although external shocks had also hurt growth. Thus, the authorities recognized that, in addition to the continuation of sound financial policies, a significant acceleration in implementing structural reforms was needed. Moreover, for the authorities’ efforts to be credible, they realized that bold steps needed to be taken without delay. 25. In this context, the authorities have developed a new ambitious economic reform program in close consultation with Fund and Bank staff to achieve these goals, and they request support from the Fund through an arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth facility (PRGF) (see the attached Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP)). 7 Excluding possible penalties, the amount of gas payment arrears to Gazprom was estimated at US$l83 million, the amount of electricity arrears to Ukraine and Romania at US$79.6 million, and the amount of oil arrears at USS IO. 1 million. These amounts exclude some USS 150 million estimated to be owed by private operators and arrears owed by Transnistria.

The authorities wished to emphasize poverty reduction in the program, given the sharp deterioration in living standards in the past decade. They have prepared an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), in collaboration with the Bank and Fund staff. The I-PRSP provides valuable information on the country’s poverty profile and outlines the government’s approach to preparing a comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). 27. The authorities’ PRS will be founded on three pillars, as indicated in the accompanying I-PRSP. Poverty reduction will depend first and foremost on economic growth and the creation of productive employment opportunities. Given the large share of the population working in agriculture and the high incidence of poverty in.rural areas, growth-enhancing strategies will need to place particular emphasis on this sector. 28. The second pillar of the PRS will be greater social protection, by increasing the efficiency and equity of the social safety net and ensuring its fiscal sustainability. This will require further improvements in the targeting of social benefits. Given the lack of a reliable means testing process, a combination of targeting mechanisms will need to be developed in consultation with the World Bank, including categorical targeting, to identify the most vulnerable segments of the population. Improvements in benefits administration will generate savings that can be used to increase benefit levels for the poorest. 29. The third pillar will focus on human development by increasing access to, and improving the quality of basic public services, such as primary health care and education. This will require setting clear priorities for service provision, further rationalization and restructuring, and efficiency enhancing investments. Reform strategies will need to be developed further with the assistance of the World Bank and the donor community in general. B. Macroeconomic Framework 30. Economic recovery appears within reach in Moldova. The recovery is expected to be led by strong export growth. With the improving external environment, the ground lost in traditional export markets following the Russian crisis can be steadily recovered. Exports are projected to reach pre-crisis levels by 2004. Growth is also expected to benefit from the continuation of tight financial policies and the implementation of structural reforms. Investment in key economic sectors is also expected to start a gradual diversification of exports to other markets, including European markets.. 31. Under this scenario, and assuming more normal weather conditions, economic activity is expected to rebound from its (low) 2000 level, with real growth projected to reach 5 percent in 2001 and increasing to 7 percent in 2003. Inflation is targeted to be reduced to 10 percent (year-end) in 2001 and beyond, leaving some room to accommodate further relative price adjustments (notably utility prices). The current account deficit is projected to improve gradually as exports rise while energy imports grow less strongly in response to the imposition of hard-budget constraints, following the privatization and restructuring of the energy sector.

The authorities and the staff agreed that the main fiscal policy objectives for the PRGF supported program would include: (i) achieving a primary budget surplus sufficient to stabilize, and subsequently reduce, the debt burden; (ii) increasing revenue mobilization capacity; and (iii) paying down wage and pension arrears. 33. To achieve a stabilization and subsequent reduction of Moldova’s large public debt burden, the authorities are determined to maintain a tight fiscal stance over the medium term, aimed at a primary budget surplus of at least 2 percent of GDP. This implies-a further reduction in the general government commitments deficit to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2001, 1 ‘/z percent of GDP in 2002, and 1 percent of GDP in 2003 (excluding an estimated 1 s-2 percent of GDP each year in project financing).8 The cash deficit will be higher to the extent additional funds will become available to reduce the stock of expenditure arrears (see below). No central bank credit will be used to finance the overall deficit in 2001: Foreign financing that will become available in addition to the amounts conservatively assumed in the 2001 budget will be set aside in the NBM as a cushion for meeting the high debt service obligations in following years. The 200 1 budget law is consistent with these objectives and was adopted by parliament by end-November (a prior action for the new program). 34. The budget for 2001 includes onIy a small amount of likely privatization proceeds earmarked for budget financing. The authorities agreed that, in light of Moldova’s high debt burden and the outstanding wage and pension arrears, any additional privatization proceeds will be used to reduce outstanding debt or pay down arrears. This policy has the added benefit that it avoids funding recurrent budgetary expenditures with non-recurrent resources, 35. Increasing revenues will depend largely on improved tax and customs administration, including a renewed emphasis on the Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU) and collection enforcement. The LTU will be reorganized as a full-fledged unit and will have the ’ The MJZFP envisages a commitments deficit (excluding project financing) for both 2000 and 2001 of 1.5 percent of GDP. The difference with the above figures stems from a US$lO million grant from the Dutch government, which was not included in the authorities’ figures. This grant is expected to be received in December 2000 and will be used for additional heating compensations. Mdl 50 million is projected to be used still in 2000 and the remaining Mdl 74 million (about 0.3 percent of GDP) will remain in a government deposit with the NBM and will be drawn down in the first quarter of 2001. Adding the outstanding balance of this grant and its subsequent use to the authorities’ numbers results in a commitments deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2000 and 1.8 percent of GDP in 2001. 9 Central bank credit will be used only to smooth out cash flows in between foreign disbursements. Net NBM credit to the government is marginally positive in 2001 due to the drawdown of government deposits.

Its functions will be expanded to include registration; return and payment accounting processing; enforcement of filing and payment obligations (including collection enforcement); audit; and taxpayer services and appeals. A full-fledged LTU covering taxpayers in the Chiinu area was established as a prior action for the new program. 36. In addition, tax and customs administration is being improved through the continued upgrading of existing tax legislation. The chapters on excises and local property taxes of the new Tax Code were adopted as a prior action for the new program, and the draft chapter on tax administration is scheduled to come into effect in Spring 200 1. A new Customs Code was also recently enacted. In addition, improvements have been made regarding the operation of fiscal posts along the border with Transnistria, while a pre-shipment inspection program is being implemented. 37. The tax base will be widened further by eliminating remaining exemptions. New legislation will be drafted with assistance from the Fund directed at limiting the scope of free economic zones (FEZs) by granting tax privileges only to export-oriented production and transshipment and establishing a clear sunset provision. More generally, the authorities agreed to refrain from introducing any new tax holidays, exemptions, amnesties, or privileges. Similarly, a start will be made with raising excise rates and the main categories of fees and user charges, to prevent their erosion by inflation. 38. With these measures, total tax revenues, excluding social fund contributions, are projected to increase as a share of GDP from 16 percent in 2000 to 17% percent in 2003. Moreover, as netting operations will be further reduced to 3 percent of revenues in 2001 (down from 10 percent in 1999) and eliminated in 2002, the increase in cash tax revenues in percent of GDP will be even more pronounced.” 39. The targeting of social assistance has been much improved with the replacement of ill-targeted energy privileges by a system of targeted cash compensations, with the adoption of the Law on Nominal Compensations, thus better cushioning the effects of increased utility prices on the most vulnerable. The authorities argued, however, that many elderly would not be able to pay their heating bills this winter, which averaged about Mdl250 lei per month while the average pension was Mdl80 per month. For the current winter season, therefore, to offset the adverse effects of higher energy prices and the ongoing privatization of the energy sector on the poorest segments of the population, available grant money from the Dutch government will be used to provide heating compensation for pensioners whose pensions do not exceed MdI 150 per month. Any remaining funds will be used to increase compensations to other categories of the poor. If additional grants become lo Social fund contributions are expected to increase somewhat less than GDP as non-labor incomes are expected to grow faster than labor incomes in the initial stages of the export-led recovery.

Staff concurred that there is little scope, or need, to reduce the aggregate level of public expenditures much further, but stressed that there remains ample room to improve the efficiency of government expenditure. This would create room to improve social assistance and health and education services. ln the 2001 budget, expenditures on health and education are budgeted to increase in real terms, and they could be raised further if additional revenues or financing would become available. To further streamline expenditures, it will be imperative for the authorities to undertake a fundamental reassessment, with the assistance of the World Bank, of the scope of government activities, particularly in the areas of health and education. The public sector reform agenda will furthermore need to include public administration reform, including streamlining the structure of the government, civil service reform, and anti-corruption measures in public service delivery, as well as improving public resource management, improved local government financial arrangements, and better capabilities for preparing budget projections and other analytical support for fiscal policy decision-making. These aspects will be a major focus of World Bank operations in the coming years, first in 2001 in the context of a Public and Private Sector Adjustment Credit (PPSAC), which will be followed in 2002 by a series of Public Sector Reform Credits (PSRC). 41. The authorities are also making further efforts to strengthen expenditure monitoring and control by registering all expenditure commitments and by establishing cash spending ceilings for spending units, and by extending Treasury operations to fully include local governments. D. Monetary Policy 42. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to achieve low levels of inflation. The main focus of monetary policy will be to limit inflation to 10 percent (end-of-period) annually by 2001, thus creating a stable environment conducive to investment and economic growth. Given a floating exchange rate, monetary aggregates will provide the nominal anchor. The NBM has adopted reserve money as its intermediate target for monetary policy, although it recognizes that forecasts for money demand remain subject to a high degree of uncertainty (as highlighted by recent developments). 43. The demand for lei balances started to increase markedly in the summer and fall of 2000; the public converted large amounts of foreign exchange through banks and exchange bureaus, partly reflecting large workers’ remittances, causing the leu exchange rate to appreciate (Figures 3 and 4). The increase in minimum capital requirements for banks added to the inflow of capital.

Credit to the economy increased by over 5 percent in real terms during the period January-September (the first sign of a recovery in real credit demand since 1996), while excess reserves of banks fell to very low levels. Repos offered by the NBM encountered little or no demand, even at relatively high interest rates and, similarly, the Ministry of Finance faced difficulties in rolling over maturing treasury bills as banks preferred crediting the economy. The monetary program for the remainder of 2000 is based on a continuation of this trend; base money is allowed to increase by up to 12 percent in the fourth quarter, stemming almost entirely from a further accumulation of foreign reserves by the NBM. Staff, however, cautioned the authorities about the risks of higher inflation should the demand far lei slow down, as might be reflected by a disappearance of the excess supply of foreign exchange or a sharp increase in banks’ excess reserves. The staff will continue to monitor the situation closely with the NBM, and the NBM assured staff that it would limit base money growth to below program targets if there would be signs of a more modest rise in money demand or accelerating inflation. 44. The monetary program for 2001 is based on a more cautious assumption regarding the recovery of money demand, which could be revisited in the context of the program review in April 2001 if money demand were to remain strong. The program for 2001 also aims at a further reconstitution of international reserves to the equivalent of more than 3 months of imports. While this requires the continuation of tight credit policies, there is room for a small increase in net central bank credit to the government (reflecting the drawdown of government deposits) and an increase in real credit to banks, and hence to the economy. 45. In the conduct of monetary policy, the NBM is returning to the situation prevailing before the Russian crisis by increasing its use of market-based tools to manage bank liquidity. The gradual revival of the market for treasury bills has already allowed the NBM to manage liquidity predominantly through open-market transactions. The NBM has started to reduce reserve requirements and intends to lower them further in 2001, in consultation with the staff. In addition, the rate of remuneration on required reserves was raised to 100 percent of the NBM’s base rate, reserve averaging was permitted with reserves held in banks’ correspondent accounts instead of in a separate blocked account, and a switch was made to a lagged system of reserve requirement accounting to ease liquidity management for banks. The secondary requirement for banks to invest 5 percent of their assets in treasury bills was eliminated in February 2000. 46. The NBM intends to conduct a more active interest rate policy to signal its policy intentions. In this regard, the Lombard facility will be adjusted to provide only very short- term access, with the rate being set independently of other lending rates and at a sufficiently high penalty level. If necessary, the NBM may introduce a deposit facility, which would set a floor under interest rates. The NBM is furthermore preparing the introduction of a real time gross settlement payments system, while it is improving its own organizational structure by strictly separating front and back office fimctions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- 47. The PRGF program will also focus on strengthening the banking system to promote financial intermediation, i.e., to efficiently and effectively mobilize the country’s savings and channel them to investments. Moldova’s banking sector is relatively small by international standards and is characterized by a large number of small banks, some of which are weak. A cornerstone of the NBM’s banking sector policy is to achieve banking sector consolidation by increasing minimum capital requirements. These have been raised in several steps in the past year and a half and will be raised further effective January 1,ZOOl to the equivalent of about US$7 million for banks with a general license. 48. Moldova has made considerable progress in the area of banking supervision and compares favorably to countries in the region. But improvements continue to be needed, such as in the number and training of bank supervisors and the frequency of inspections. The staff stressed that the NBM will need to take strong actions against banks that fail to meet prudential regulations, including the removal of management and the withdrawal of licenses. Related to this, the process of bank liquidation will be streamlined by amending the law on financial institutions to transfer the responsibility for the liquidation process from the NBM to the courts. The Savings Bank continues to be under close scrutiny of the NBM and a plan for its privatization will be prepared in 2001. 49. The authorities agreed with the staff that a deposit insurance scheme, which could bolster the public’s confidence in the banking system, could be introduced only when a higher degree of capitalization of the banking system has been achieved. The authorities concurred that in the current situation anything other than a very limited scheme would pose a considerable moral hazard risk and could have large potential fiscal costs. E. Structural Policies 50. The staff stressed that sustainable growth and an improvement of Moldova’s external debt position could not be achieved in the absence of a determined implementation of a strong and convincing structural reform strategy. 51. The authorities recognized that the structural reform agenda is long and there is a need to prioritize structural measures, in close consultation with the staff of the Fund and the World Bank, focusing on those areas that are crucial to restoring growth. The authorities intend to focus particularly on reforms in three main areas: (i) large scale privatization to strategic investors, especially in agro-processing, energy, and telecommunications; (ii) the completion of the break-up of the state farm sector, privatization and titling of land, and supporting measures to promote land trading; and (iii) the creation of a legal framework appropriate for a market economy. 52. To a large extent these main areas of reform will be key components of the two prospective adjustment lending operations by the World Bank. Both the PPSAC and the PSRC will include elements directed at the development of the private sector, with the PSRC building upon the progress made under the PPSAC. The PPSAC, which is currently under preparation, will focus on pushing the privatization program further along, including the sale Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - of wineries, remaining power distribution and generation companies, Moldtelecom, as well as other key state-owned enterprises. Progress has already been made in the energy sector with the privatization of three electricity distribution companies to a strategic investor, while the sale of the remaining two distribution companies and the power generation companies is underway. 53. In the area of agricultural reform, the PPSAC will aim at completing the land privatization program and establishing an agricultural support policy (credit mechanisms, marketing channels). The liquidation of state and collective farms is expected to be completed by the end of 2000, while the process of issuing land titles to individual farmers should be completed by mid-2001. From a longer-term perspective, an active land trading market will need to emerge to facilitate the consolidation of the very small plot sizes. In addition to the issuance of land titles, this will require the registration of these titles in the national cadastre, easy and affordable access to notary services, and improvements in the legal fiamework in general. 54. The PPSAC is also to initiate legal and regulatory reform, including streamlining enterprise registration and licensing requirements in order to facilitate easy entry by new enterprises and reduce the scope for corruption, as well as reform of the enterprise restructuring mechanism. 55. In the PRGF program the authorities intend, with agreement of the staff and in close consultation with the World Bank, to focus on a limited number of structural reform measures that are critical to the realization of the program’s objectives: l The privatization of the wineries. The wine-producing sector has a clear macroeconomic importance; in 1997 and 1998, exports of wine and spirits accounted for over 30 percent of total exports of goods, while in 1999 the share was still over 20 percent. Without investment by strategic investors in the wine-producing sector, Moldova will not be able to exploit its comparative advantages and generate the needed growth in exports. Privatization would also help to address governance and transparency issues in this sector; the wineries have not been operated with due regard to commercial considerations. Given the need to establish momentum in this area, legislation has been adopted as a prior action for the program that allows the privatization of five strategic wineries (and the tobacco companies) through an open-tender process. The authorities will prepare the sale of these enterprises with the assistance of the World Bank and plan to offer at least two wineries for sale by May 1,200l. 0 The privatization of Moldtelecom. Moldtelecom’s potential value could be in the order of US$50-100 million and the proceeds from its sale would need to be used to service or retire Moldova’s external debt. Privatizing Moldtelecom under best international practices in a transparent process will include preparatory steps such as hiring an investment bank to assist in the sale. A tender for selecting a financial advisor will be launched by February 1,200 1.

This measure aims at improving financial discipline, governance, as well as revenue collection for the budget. Initiating restructuring or bankruptcy procedures against 24 enterprises with arrears to the budget in excess of Md13 million constituted a prior action for the new program. To speed up the process of liquidating or restructuring these and other firms, amendments to the law on bankruptcy will be submitted to parliament by mid-February 200 1. l Improving the legal framework. A new Civil Code, drafted with German technical assistance, was approved by parliament in first reading in October 2000 and is expected to be adopted by mid-2001. This would establish the overall legal framework for defining property rights and contractual obligations. Also, a policy was instituted requiring all licenses above US$l million to be approved by the Council of Ministers and to be published in the official gazette. Other measures in this area will include amendments to the laws on bankruptcy and collateral, which will also benefit banks lending operations by better enabling enforceable property rights and secured obligations, and the amendments to the laws on free economic zones and on financial institutions. Furthermore, to improve transparency and good governance, a new law on financial disclosure will be submitted to parliament that would require regular reporting of assets and business relations by senior officials and parliamentarians. F. External Outlook and Policies, and Capacity to Repay the Fund 56. Even with a strong resumption of growth and tight financial policies, Moldova’s external debt outlook remains precarious. A debt sustainability analysis conducted in close cooperation with the World Bank and presented in Appendix VI suggests that under such assumptions, and assuming that balance of payments financing will be available on concessional terms, largely from the Fund and the World Bank, the current account deficit is projected to decline gradually to around 5 percent of GDP, while Moldova’s external debt indicators show a steady improvement over the medium term to manageable levels (Tables 6 and 7; Figure 5). In the short run, however, Moldova is likely to face difficulties, particularly in 2002-when a bullet repayment of US$ 75 million in Eurobonds falls due-and in 2003. The ratio of the net present value (NPV) of public and publicly guaranteed debt to exports will remain well over 100 percent during 2001-2003. In terms of fiscal indicators, the situation looks worse: the ratio of the NPV of public and publicly guaranteed debt to central government revenues is projected to range between 250-350 percent in the coming years. 57. The debt situation could become considerably more problematic should the economic recovery take longer to materialize, due to policy slippages, adverse weather conditions or external shocks. Indeed, as indicated in Appendix VI, under a scenario of lower (export) growth Moldova’s liquidity problem could become a solvency problem.

The authorities concurred with the staff that the debt situation clearly underscores the need to move ahead forcefully with the transition process to generate the much needed supply response. It also underlines the need to use privatization proceeds (notably from large scale operations such as the sale of Moldtelecom) for the servicing of external debt or to retire debt if feasible, as has been agreed with the authorities, In addition, the authorities are actively involved in seeking to reschedule their bilateral debt, while the Dutch government will be organizing a Consultative Group meeting for Moldova in early 200 1 to mobilize financial assistance from bilateral creditors and donors. Increased assistance from bilateral creditors on concessional terms would also be warranted to prevent a situation in which the majority of Moldova’s external debt would be held by the Fund and the World Bank. 59. A successful recovery will depend on international trade. The authorities are well aware of this and remain committed to maintaining a liberal exchange and trade regime. They also agreed with the staff that, given Moldova’s vulnerability to external shocks, maintaining a floating exchange rate regime is in the country’s best interest. Interventions by the NBM will continue to be limited to smoothing short-term fluctuations and meeting reserve targets. 60. Moldova has a relatively low level of tariff protection.” Negotiations on WTO accession are virtually completed. The agreements reached in this process would allow Moldova to increase import tariffs for a number of goods. The staff, however, urged the authorities to refrain from raising import tariffs, relative to the 1999 average level, and not to raise the maximum tariff rate of 15 percent. The authorities agreed with this, despite considerable pressure from domestic producers to raise the level of protection. The authorities also resisted introducing a temporary import surcharge, as they accepted that ultimately the exchange rate would be the more appropriate instrument to address any persistent trade imbalances. A ban on the export of grains, prompted by the drought in early 2000, was eliminated as a prior action for the new program. 61. The wide-spread nonpayment for energy consumption in the past several years, partly resulting from the unfunded generous energy privileges granted to large parts of the population, caused an accumulation of energy arrears, both internal and external. The ongoing privatization of the energy sector and the elimination of energy privileges go a long I’ The 1999 level of the unweighted average import tariff was 8.6 percent. PDR’s trade restrictiveness index for Moldova is 1, indicating a very liberal trade regime. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - way to avoid a further build up of energy arrears, but a large stock remains. In principle, these are commercial debts, but the authorities stressed that this problem could not be left unaddressed if the country was not to face supply disruptions. On the other hand, the staff stressed that the authorities should not bail out the remaining state-owned energy companies or other enterprises. Instead, the authorities agreed to seek technical assistance from the Fund and the World Bank to develop a strategy to deal with this issue in a systematic manner, based on market principles and including audits of these arrears by reputable accounting firms. In the meantime, the government assured that it would not take upon itself any debts of the energy companies. 62. Despite obvious risks to the program, Moldova is not expected to encounter diffwulties in servicing its obligations to the Fund. International reserve coverage is projected to remain at relatively comfortable levels. Risks remain, however, as the program is predicated on continued international financial support, and delays in policy implementation may cause delays in financing becoming available. Based on the strength of the authorities’ program, Moldova’s satisfactory record regarding macrostabilization and renewed efforts in structural reforms, and the projected residual financing needs, the staff recommends access under the new three-year arrangement to be 90 percent of quota (SDR 110.88 million). Moldova’s use of Fund resources is projected to rise to about SDR 144 million by end-2001 (117 percent of quota) and further to SDR 180 million by end-2003 (146 percent of quota) (Table 8), before steadily declining. While there are risks to the program, in the staffs view, the risks to the Fund of the increased exposure to Moldova are acceptable in light of the strength of the authorities’ program and the good record the authorities have in meeting debt-service payments to the Fund. v. PROGRAMMONITORING 63. The authorities have implemented several measures prior to Board consideration of the program, in order to demonstrate their strong commitment (Table 9). Quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets under the new program are specified in Table 10 and in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding attached to the MEFP. The arrangement will involve quarterly monitoring and disbursements, as well as semi-annual reviews (Table 11). VI. STAFFAPPRAISAL 64. Moldova continues to make progress in transforming its economy under difficult circumstances. The effects of the Russia crisis linger; trade and output are depressed, but are showing signs of recovery. Inflation is coming down again. Changes in government have hampered the reform process; there have been three governments since March 1999. The current government has adopted an economic program, reflected in the MEFP, that is, in all essential respects, unchanged from that discussed with the previous government and, in February, with the current government (allowing for changes in the dates for prior actions and structural benchmarks). In the past, it was not possible to put a program into place owing to a lack of parliamentary support. Parliament has now approved the key measures that were Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - previously hurdles, notably the privatization of wineries and the tobacco sector. While the government does not have a working majority in parliament, it has been able to muster the necessary legislative support for its program, albeit with some difficulty upon occasion, Throughout this period, the NBM has continued to pursue a cautious, prudent monetary policy. 65. The government has followed the staffs advice, in the absence of a Fund-supported program, in executing the 2000 budget, a somewhat tighter budget than the 1999 budget owing to the absence of foreign financing. The government has drafted, and parliament has adopted, a budget for 2001 agreed with the staff in July and updated in October. Importantly, the 2001 budget consolidates the very significant fiscal achievement accomplished in 1999 and maintained in 2000: a reduction of the fiscal deficit, on a commitments basis, of 6 percent of GDP. The fiscal stance has been dictated by the limited availability of foreign financing, the need to reduce the debt burden and the strong desire to decrease domestic arrears. This is one very clear indication of the government’s commitment to transformation. 66. With relatively little scope left for expenditure reduction and higher tax rates, the focus has been on tax administration and compliance. Here the record has been relatively good. Tax collection improved for most categories, except for excises due to increased smuggling. A large taxpayers unit has been established in Chiinu with plans to extend coverage to the rest of the country in the near future. Customs administration has been strengthened by the introduction of a new, modem customs code. Tax offsetting operations will be limited to three percent of total revenue in 2001, down from 10 percent in 1999. The partial hiring freeze remains in effect and the extension of the treasury system to local governments is proceeding on schedule. And the authorities have also recently introduced, in collaboration with the World Bank, an improved nominal compensation scheme that better targets the most vulnerable groups in the population. These are also concrete actions that demonstrate the authorities’ commitment, but the staff urges the authorities to further improve tax collection enforcement and to counter tax evasion. 67. With respect to privatization proceeds, the program calls for using funds in excess of a relatively small amount earmarked for budget support to reduce outstanding debt, including wage and pension arrears, in consultation with the Fund staff. This is a prudent policy which uses the bulk of proceeds from the liquidation of state assets to offset the stock of state debt. It has the added advantage of not requiring either the staff or the authorities to estimate privatization receipts which cannot be quantified with any precision ex ante. 68. Structural impediments continue to be a major focus of the program. In the view of the staff, the absence of the needed supply responses has, in large measure, been due to structural rigidities in the system. These have been addressed in the program. Accordingly, parliamentary approval of privatization plans for five wineries and the tobacco sector was a prior action which has now been taken. This is important because of the central role agriculture in general, and the wineries in particular, play in the Moldovan economy. Privatization of the telecommunications sector is proceeding with guidance from the World Bank, and an independent telecommunications regulatory agency has been established. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - government has also undertaken to sell its remaining share in Moldovagas as soon as conditions permit. Moreover, most state farms have been liquidated and put into private hands, over 1 million land titles (almost half of agricultural land) have been registered, and the notary system has been streamlined to facilitate the operation of the land market. 69. Privatization is only the first step in attracting strategic investment, however. An improvement in the investment climate is also necessary and is the objective of a number of measures in the program. The country’s first civil code has been submitted to parliament which has approved it in its first reading with final approval scheduled by June 2001. And, within the next few months, the authorities plan to submit to-parliament amendments to bankruptcy and collateral legislation in order to better protect creditors and thereby increase commercial lending. To strengthen financial discipline, the state has initiated bankruptcy or restructuring proceedings against 24 enterprises. All of these actions are substantial and signal the authorities’ ownership of the program and ability to implement difficult policies in a difficult time. 70. Transparency and good governance have increasingly become a concern in Moldova. To demonstrate their commitment, the authorities have instituted a policy requiring all licenses above US$l million to be approved by the Council of Ministers and published in the official gazette. The authorities are also following World Bank recommendations with respect to openness and transparency in the privatization process. The legislation governing free economic zones is being revised, with Fund help, in order to limit these zones to export production and transshipment, thereby eliminating the abuses of the past. And the authorities have agreed to enact a financial disclosure law for senior officials and parliamentarians. 71. The energy sector has been a long standing concern in Moldova; at times the quasi- fiscal deficit generated by the energy sector has exceeded the fiscal deficit itself. Moldovagas is now on a commercial basis. In early 2000, US$90 million of debts to Gazprom were rescheduled and payments by budgetary institutions for energy are now current. Importantly, three of the five electricity distribution companies were recently sold in an open fashion to an international strategic investor. Plans to sell the remaining two companies and the three generation companies are at an advanced stage. While there are unresolved issues in the energy sector-external debt for gas and electricity among them-the authorities have shown a willingness and ability to address problems in this sector. 72. A legacy of fiscal laxness and slow structural reform in the past has led to large fiscal-and quasi-fiscal deficits -as well as unsustainable current account imbalances and, consequently, to a very large stock of external debt. The authorities have been able to buy back some of this at a discount and reschedule some of the rest. While the stock is still disturbingly large, the staff notes that Moldova has avoided default on its external obligations without recourse to any trade, exchange or payments restrictions. And, in its view, with good policies and a moderately favorable external environment, Moldova should be able to bring its debt level down to a manageable level, although the situation will be difficult in 2002-when USS 75 million in Eurobonds falls due-and in 2003.

The central bank has continued to maintain appropriately tight financial policies; confidence in the leu has strengthened recently as has the demand for money. In the view of the staff, this has come about because of some decrease in political uncertainty and preliminary indications of a resumption of economic’growth, as evidenced by increased lending from the banking system to the economy. The staff urges the NBM to monitor monetary developments closely, however, and limit money growth should the increase in the demand for money slow down. The leu floats freely with the central bank intervening only to smooth fluctuations and to meet foreign exchange reserve targets, which have been comfortably met, despite making US$67 million in debt-service payments in the first nine months of 2000. In the view of the staff, given Moldova’s vulnerability to external shocks maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime is the correct policy. Still, markets are very thin and the financial system fragile; any shocks could result in large interest and exchange rate movements. With respect to the financial system, the NBM has shown great resolve in increasing the minimum capital requirements to European norms, restructuring the Savings Bank, and canceling banking licenses when required. It has shown itself to be a strong, independent central bank that follows a cautious monetary policy, and one that is able to react and respond decisively to changing market conditions, as evidenced by its actions during the Russian crisis. 74. Both imports and exports fell dramatically in the wake of the Russian crisis and have yet to fully recover. A source of growing concern has been the inability of the country to reorient exports away from traditional, weak markets to new markets. By conventional measures Moldova is competitive; it is the staffs view that severe structural rigidities and inertia are at the heart of the problem. These can be solved only in the medium term with determined resolve to implement structural reform. Another cause for concern is the incipient pressure for protectionist measures, but Moldova has made enormous progress in liberalizing foreign trade and has, to date, resisted this pressure. 75. While generally adequate for surveillance and program monitoring purposes, Moldova’s official statistics and statistical systems have serious deficiencies, which are of concern. This is particularly true for national accounts and fiscal data, notably the timeliness and accuracy of expenditures and arrears of the Social Fund and local governments. Technical assistance from the World Bank on the treasury system and from STA should help improve the latter. Monetary and balance of payments data have improved in recent years and are generally satisfactory for effective surveillance. The staff has highlighted the importance of timely and accurate statistics in discussions with the authorities and called for more resources to be allocated to the statistical needs of the country, within the difficult budgetary situation. 76. Despite the encouraging signs noted above, there are very real risks to the program. The political situation remains precarious and the government will continue to be subject to political pressures. The program is also predicated on large amounts of external financing from other IFIs and bilateral creditors; if there are delays, the program would be at risk. And, of course, conditions in Moldova’s major trading partners, Russia in particular, will continue to have a major impact. If the export-led economic recovery takes longer to materiahze, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - Moldova’s debt burden could well turn into a solvency problem. Nevertheless, the authorities have agreed to an ambitious, but feasible, policy program. In the opinion of the staff, they have demonstrated an acceptable track record based on their performance through the first nine months of the year and by achieving all prior actions. Despite the obvious risks, the staff recommends Executive Board approval of Moldova’s request for an arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. 77. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Moldova be held en the standard 12-month cycle. The staff will visit Moldova in January/February 200 1 to assess end year performance; the first review under the PRGF could be completed by June 200 1.

Exchange Rate Arrangement: Prior to the introduction of the Moldovan leu on November 29, 1993, the Russian ruble (supplemented by NBM-issued ruble denominated coupons) was the legal tender in Moldova. The government introduced the leu at a conversion rate of one leu equal to 1,000 Moldovan rubles and an exchange rate of one dollar equal to 3.85 lei. The leu remained broadly stable around Mdl4.75/$ until mid-October 1998. It has since depreciated against the dollar and traded at Mdl 12.3084 = US$l on October 3 1,200O. Foreign exchange is traded on the Chigin u Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange (CIFCE). Operations of the CIFCE started at the beginning of 1993, and daily auctions commenced in early February 1995. An active foreign exchange cash market also exists within authorized banks and foreign exchange bureaus. From November 16, 1993, through end-October 1998, the U.S. dollar exchange rate established in the CIFCE was the official exchange rate quoted by the NBM. Since November 2, 1998, the official rate is determined as the transaction weighted average of all market transactions as announced by the NBM. The NBM quotes exchange rates of the leu for other currencies on the basis of the leu-U.S. dollar rate and the cross-rate relationships between the U.S. dollar and the currencies concerned in the international market. VIII. Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on August 6,200O (SM/99/195; 7/30/00). IX. Use of Fund Resources: On February 4, 1993, Moldova purchased Fund resources totaling SDR 13.5 million, equivalent to 15 percent of quota under the Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facilities (CCFF) (EBS/93/8, l/15/93). This was followed by a first drawing under the Systemic Transformation Facility (STF) of SDR 22.5 million, equivalent to 25 percent of quota, which was approved by the Board on September 16, 1993 (EBS/93/149,9/8/93). On December 17, 1993 (EBS/93/177, 1 l/l 6/93), the Board approved a purchase of Fund resources under a stand-by arrangement (SBA) in the amount of SDR 5 1.75 million and the drawing of the second tranche of the STF to&ding SDR 22.5 million. On December 19, 1994, Moldova made a second purchase under the CCFF totaling SDR 12.2 million, equivalent to 13.5 percent of quota, in conjunction with the second review of the SBA which expired at end-March 1995. The Board approved a successor SBA for Moldova in an amount totaling SDR 58.05 million (equivalent to 65 percent of quota) on March 22, 1995 (EBS/95/26, 3/2/95). Three purchases, totaling SDR 32.4 million (equivalent to 36 percent of quota), were made under the arrangement. An Extended Arrangement in an amount totaling SDR 135 million (equivalent to 150 percent of old quota) was approved by the Executive Board on May 20, 1996 (EBS/96/68,5/6/96). At the time of the third review, the program was extended by one year to May 19,200O. Five purchases totaling SDR 87.5 million (equivalent to 97 percent of old quota) have been made under the current arrangement and the fourth review has been completed (EBS/99/142; 7/29/99).

Moldova was made IDA eligible (blend status) in May 1997, and then in May 2000 became an IDA only country. The first loan to Moldova was an Emergency Drought Recovery Loan ($26 million), approved in March 1993. The loan was used to finance purchase of key agricultural inputs and was fully disbursed. A Rehabilitation Loan ($60 million), approved in October 1993, financed essential imports in support of the structural reform program and provided non- inflationary financing of the budget; it is fully disbursed. With regard to investment lending and guarantees, in 1995 a Pre-export Guarantee Facility ($30 million) was established to provide political risk insurance to attract working capital loans from abroad. However, it was cancelled in July 1997, owing to lack of progress, The investment program began in 1996 with the approval of the first Private Sector Development Loan ($35 million) which was designed primarily to establish a support mechanism and credit line for restructuring, and the First Agriculture project ($10 million) aimed at export promotion, institution building, investment support and providing aid for agricultural research. Also in 1996, an Energy project ($10 million) was approved which intended to put gas and electricity sales on a commercial basis, and establish the state-owned gas company (Moldovagas) and the power generation and distribution company (Moldenergo) as financially viable enterprises. The first IFC investment in Moldova ($10 million in INCON, a major agro-processor) was approved in December 1996. Expansion of investment lending continued in 1997 and 1998, with the General Education project (IDA $5 million, IBRD $16.8 million) aimed at improving curriculum in schools, training teachers and establishing a textbook rental scheme, the PSD II project (IDA $9 million) aimed primarily at training of business managers, and a $15.9 million IDA credit for the Cadastre project. This was followed in 1999 by an IDA credit of $15 million in support of the Social Investment Fund project, and the Social Protection Management Project (IDA $11.1 million) aimed at reform of Moldova’s pension system. Finally, in August 2000 a Health Reform Project (IDA $10 million and co-financing from the Dutch government $10 million) was approved, which will provide investment for modemizing emergency services and primary health care, reducing excess capacity in the health sector, strengthening institutional capacity, and guaranteed universal access to a minimum package of health services, Priority sectors for future investments include agriculture, energy, private sector development and the social sectors, Currently, a rural investment and services project and a second energy project are in advanced (but varying) stages of preparation. Moldova was made IDA eligible (blend status) in 1997, and then became IDA-only in early 2000. Since 1994 three related structural adjustment operations have been approved and implemented. These operations support a deepening of structural reforms with particular emphasis on improving financial discipline; an acceleration of cash privatization; de- monopolization and privatization of the energy sector and telecom; and through reforms in the urban and rural land markets. The First Structural Adjustment Loan ($60 million) was approved in December 1994. The Second Structural Adjustment Loan ($100 million, of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-47- APPENDIX II which IDA credit of $45 million) was approved in 1997. The first of three tranches of the SAL II (IDA $35 million) was disbursed in September 1997, a blend second tranche ($35 million) in May 1999, and the third tranche was cancelled and replaced with a $40 million SAC credit in two tranches, which was approved on June 24, 1999. The first tranche of $20 million was disbursed in August 1999. Disbursement of the second tranche of the SAC is delayed due to a small number of outstanding structural issues, and inability of the Authorities to establish a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. Pending agreement on the PRGF, the second tranche disbursement of the SAC is expected by year-end 2000. Planned future adjustment support includes a Public and Private Sector Adjustment Credit (PPSAC) that will continue and deepen the SAL/SAC program, while launching a far reaching public sector reform program. The PPSAC will then be followed by a series of Public Sector Reform Credits (PSRC) aimed at comprehensive reform of the public sector, including public administration and civil service reform, improved public resource management, social service reform, and a strengthening of local governments.

To date the global value of projects supported, in whole or in part, totals around $250 million. Nienteen projects have been signed totaling EUR 15 1.7 million (US$l26 million) of EBRD resources, of which EUR 109 million has been disbursed. These include: (i) a wine export promotion project which is targeting the upgrading of the main Moldovan wineries and the restructuring of the wine sector (USD 30 million); (ii) an energy efficiency project for upgrading the heating distribution networks in major Moldovan cities (USD 9 million); (iii) a credit line for Moldova-Agroindbank for onlending to small and medium enterprises (USD 20 million); (iv) a credit line and equity investment for Victoria Bank (USD 4 million); (v) a project for linking Moldovan satellite earth stations to the Eurovision Network (USD 1 million); (vi) a road rehabilitation loan (USD 12 million); (vii) partial financing for construction of a new oil terminal at Giurgulesti (USD 19 million); and (viii) credit facilities for micro enterprises through four local banks (USD 5 million); (ix) rehabilitating Chisinau’s water services (USD 22 million); (x) Chisinau Airport Modemization (USD 9 million); and a convertible loan to Agroindbank (IJSD 8 million); (xi) participation in two capital increases in Victoria Bank (USD 0.5 million); (xii) trade facilitation program for Victoriabank, Moldova-Agroindbank, and Moldindconbank (regional TFP); and (xiii) equity participation in the micro-lending company (USD 0.1 million). Five projects totaling USD 40 million are currently being prepared and reviewed and include equity participation (USD 5 million) and debt financing (USD 25 million) in the power distribution company; the second micro-lending project (EUR 5 million), equity participation and credit-line for the micro-lending company, a sugar company loan (EUR 13 million) and a number of EUR 1-3 million transaction with private companies at the exploratory stage. In addition, some 27 Technical Cooperation projects have been completed or approved (EUR 7.3 million).

Although generally adequate for surveillance and program monitoring there are still shortcomings in Moldova’s official statistics, especially as regards national accounts. Data for monitoring macroeconomic developments are provided by the Moldovan authorities in a timely manner (see Appendix V). 2. National accounts statistics are now being prepared following the 1993 SNA methodology. GDP is estimated from the production and the expenditure sides through 1998. Estimates do not include the Transnistria region for which data have not been collected since 199 1, Moreover, the quality of data remains poor in some respects: (i) changes in inventories are improperly valued; (ii) quarterly estimates remain crude; (iii) the deflation of nominal data appear inaccurate due to inadequate price and volume indices; (iv) private sector activities, transactions of nonprofit institutions serving households and of new financial institutions are not covered adequately; and (v) the coverage of trade remains inadequate. 3. Price statistics still have various shortcomings. For the CPI price collection is limited geographically and missing data are not imputed following a standard procedure. However, the weights were adjusted as of January 1999, based on a World Bank-supported update of the household budget survey conducted in 1997. 4. Labor market statistics remain inadequate for analyzing macroeconomic developments: (i) unemployment data following IL0 methodology are not available; and (ii) wage data do not include fringe benefits which form an important part of workers’ compensation. 5. Fiscal statistics: Fiscal data suffer from a number of shortcomings. In particular, there are problems with the timeliness and accuracy of government expenditure data and information on the arrears of the Social Fund and local governments. A recent GFS statistical missions assisted the authorities to resolve data issues and provide technical assistance in the accounts classification. In addition, World Bank technical assistance was provided to improving the budgetary reports of local authorities as well as the Social Fund. 6. Balance of payments and external debt statistics have greatly improved in quality over the last few years and the compilation methodology follows the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Problems remain related to: (i) under-reporting of imports and exports; (ii) collection of data on services; (iii) measurement of private capital inflows, including direct investment data; and (iv) treatment of transactions with Transnistria. Moldova disseminates some international investment position statistics. 7. Money and banking statistics reported to the Fund have improved, following a series of technical assistance missions from the Fund. A new chart of accounts was introduced for the NBM in 1996 and commercial banks adopted a new chart of accounts and moved to IAS with effect from January 1,1998.

SUMMARY Moldova’s external debt increased from essentially zero debt at the beginning of the 1990s to approximately US$lS billion (or 112 percent of GDP) at end-1999. This consisted of US$936 million in public and publicly guaranteed debt (almost 65 percent of the total), US$416 million in energy payment arrears (approximately 30 percent of the total), and US$ 105 million in private sector debt. Underlying the deterioration of Moldova’s external debt indicators were large external current account deficits in the mid-1990s and a sharp depreciation of the leu following the Russian crisis. Debts were contracted on only moderately concessional terms; the NW of public and publicly guaranteed debt is estimated at US$895 million at end-1999; over half of the country’s public and publicly guaranteed debt was owed to multilateral institutions. Debt indicators could improve substantially over the medium term under a scenario of strong export-led growth that is supported by sound economic and financial policies and strong structural reforms. However, even under favorable assumptions, Moldova is likely to face liquidity problems in the short run, particularly in 2002 and 2003, when large repayments fall due. Moreover, in terms of fiscal indicators, the debt situation looks more dramatic, as the ratio of the net present value of public and publicly guaranteed debt to central government revenues will remain in excess of 250 percent during 2001-03. The short term problems would be exacerbated should the economic recovery take longer to materialize, because of policy slippages, external shocks or adverse weather conditions. Indeed, under a scenario of lower (export) growth, Moldova’s liquidity problem would come closer to a solvency problem. 11. INTRODUCTION I. This note discusses issues related to Moldova’s external debt situation at the end of 1999 and the sustainability of its dynamics through 2010, based on loan-by-loan information provided by the Moldovan authorities.] The debt estimates and net present value (NPV) calculation presented in this note are preliminary and may need to be updated in the ’ The reconciliation of data on debt stock outstanding and flows as of end-1999 revealed small discrepancies between Fund records and the records of the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of Moldova.

In addition, a full accounting and resolution of-the external payment arrears contracted by both the government and private sector operators on the delivery of energy imports has not yet been completed. This analysis, which was prepared in consultation with World Bank staff, was discussed with the authorities during the 2000 Article IV consultation mission. 111. THE EXTERNAL DEBT SITUATION AT END-1999 2. Moldova’s external public and publicly guaranteed debt has grown at a rapid pace, from almost zero in the early 1990s to an estimated face value of US$936 million at end- 1999, equivalent to 71.8 percent of GDP. Including external payment arrears on imported energy supplies and private debt, Moldova’s total external debt amounted to about US$1.5 billion at the end of 1999 (112 percent of GDP). 3. This indebtedness reflected the accumulation of large and growing external current account deficits in the mid-1990s. Debt indicators deterioratead further following the sharp nominal depreciation of the leu in the aftermath of the Russian crisis. On average, debts were contracted on only moderately concessional terms; the net present value of the public and publicly guaranteed debt was estimated at US$895 million (68.7 percent of GDP) at end- 1999.2 The NPV of debt-to-export ratio (three-year average ending in 1999) and the debt-to- fiscal-revenue ratio (central government) reached 112 percent and 364 percent, respectively, while the debt service on public and publicly guaranteed debt represented 32.7 percent of exports of goods and services, putting into question the capacity of Moldova to meet its current and future external debt service obligations in full, without recourse to debt rescheduling and/or debt relief, accumulation of further arrears, and without unduly compromising growth. ;‘* Already by end- 1999, the arrears accumulated on public and publicly guaranteed debt on interest and principal) amounted to about US$95 million (7.3 percent of GDP), of which USS89 million represented arrears to the Russian Federation (including a credit from Oneximbank), pending the completion of the rescheduling negotiations in 2000, and US$6 million represented arrears on government guarantees granted to the EBRD and other European commercial creditors. 5. As to the composition of these obligations, more than half of Moldova’s outstanding public debt was owed to multilateral institutions, including to the Fund (US$175 million, 2 The difference between the face value and the NPV of debt (i.e., the discounted value of all future debt-service payments due on the debt disbursed and outstanding at a given point in time) is called the grant element. A positive grant element implies that the interest rate on a given loan is smaller than the discounted rate used to calculate the NPV, and therefore, that the loan has a concessional element. Moldova was granted IDA eligibility by the World Bank in April 1997 and became ESAF-eligible in March 1999.

Debt owed to bilateral official creditors represented 28 percent of total debt, including Russia (US$83 million), 3 the United States (US$65 million), the European Union (US$62 million) and Japan (uS$37 million). Other official obligations amounted to about 15 percent of the total and included a five year US$75 million Eurobonds (issued in 1997 with bullet repayment in 2002) and a number of direct and publicly guaranteed credits from foreign banks (US$60 million). 6. Moldova has also accumulated large external payment arrears on imported energy supplies (gas, electricity, and oil) during 1994-99. By end-1999, the stock of energy arrears was tentatively estimated at US$416 million (32 percent of GDP), of which up to US$273 million was owed by state-owned enterprises and about US$lSO million owed by private operators.4 The main creditors were Russian on gas imports, Ukrainian and Romanian on electricity imports and Romanian on oil imports. 7. In 2000, steps were taken to reduce arrears on debt service obligations and energy payments. In March, USS137 million of arrears due to Gazprom were settled through: (i) the issuance of promissory notes in value of US$90 million to pay off the debts on account of the natural gas deliveries of 1996 and 1997 and (ii) the agreement on a debt-equity swap in the gas sector, whereby Gazprom acquired 5 1 percent of Moldovagas in return for the clearance of US$47 millions of arrears. In April, the rescheduling agreement with the Russian authorities covering the total of the Russian debt, including that to Oneximbank, was eventually signed.5 Also, rescheduling discussions were successfully launched with a number of commercial creditors on government guarantees. 8. Notwithstanding these efforts to reach rescheduling agreements with creditors and to normalize relations with energy suppliers, the sustainability of Moldova’s external debt is at 3 Moldova’s debt vis-a-vis Russia was made of a restructured loan in the amount of US$88.6 million granted in 1996 on account of two previous Russian credits and a US$15 million loan extended by the Oneximbank in 1996 and guaranteed by the Russian government. 4 As mentioned above, a full auditing of Moldova’s external arrears on energy imports has still to be completed, Accordingly, the actual outstanding obligations of state-owned companies or potential government contingent liabilities on energy imports are unclear. In particular, there is no official record of the payments already made through various intermediaries in the form of barter or trilateral clearing operations. Accordingly, the reported amount of energy arrears should be considered as an upper limit. ’ According to the agreement, the debt obligations of Moldova to the Russian Federation (including penalties) were set at US$91.6 million, excluding US$30.4 million owed by the Transnistrian region. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 55 - APPENDIX VI risk given the recent deterioration of debt indicators. In order to assess this sustainability, two scenarios corresponding to two different external envhonments (i.e., baseline and low case) were developed to assess whether Moldova is in a position to maintain a sustainable external current account balance and to service its external obligations over time. Iv. BASELINE SCENARIO 9. The base case scenario is predicated on the pursuit of sound economic and financial policies and accelerated structural reforms; policies and reforms that would typically deserve the support of the Bank and the Fund. This scenario also assumes that Moldova’s external environment will remain favorable, in particular, that the Russian and other BR0 markets will continue to gradually recover. Moldova being a small and land- locked economy, the strategy aims at achieving higher sustainable economic growth through trade promotion and the rationalization of energy imports. Accordingly, the scenario assumes a sustained recovery of both exports and non-energy imports over the medium term coupled with a gradual diversification of the export base towards non-BR0 markets. After the sharp decline in 1998-2000, the GDP growth rate is projected to pick up to 8 percent in 2004-05 before stabilizing at 6 percent during 2006-10, as key sectors open up to strategic private investors.6 As a ratio to GDP, exports should recover by 2005 the level prevailing in the mid- 1990s while imports would remain temporarily below the historical levels as energy imports are being rationalized. By 2010, exports and imports are projected to reach 44 percent and 52 percent of GDP, respectively, making Moldova a more open economy (Table 6). Achieving this rate of economic growth would critically depend on increasing domestic private saving and private investment, as the public sector continues to reduce its role in productive activities and public saving rise (see below). Gross domestic investment is assumed to grow from 26 percent of GDP in 1999 to 29 percent in 2005, and 30 percent in 2010, while total national saving is projected to reach 25 percent of GDP by 2010.’ As a result of these savings-investment balances, the external current account deficit (after grants) would hover around 5 percent of GDP by 2010. 10. The scenario assumes that the fiscal consolidation achieved in 1999 will be pursued over the medium term and that a primary fiscal surplus on a commitments basis of at least 2 percent of GDP (excluding project financing) is maintained over the medium term to stabilize, and then reduce, the stock of debts accumulated since independence. Accordingly, it assumes that: (i) the deficit of the general government (on a commitment basis) would not exceed one percent of GDP over the medium-term; (ii) the share of central government revenue to GDP would remain stable at 19 percent throughout the period; (iii) no privatization proceeds will be received in the years after 200 1, and that there will be no 6 Under this scenario, the GDP measured in US dollars would recover its 1997 level (pre- Russian crisis) in 2005. 7 There are considerable shortcomings in Moldova’s national accounts data.

The tight fiscal stance will nonetheless reserve room for the government’s social commitments. Total public investments are pro’ected to increase from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2000 to close to 2 percent in the steady state. d Spending on health and education will be increased as a share of GDP, and their composition improved: expenditures will be better targeted with the aim to make basic services available to the poor. 11. The pursuit of a prudent monetary policy should contribute to sharply reduce inflation in 2001-02. In particular, it is assumed that the NBM would be able to restore the financial stability that prevailed before the Russian crisis and that confidence in the leu would strengthen over time. The free float exchange rate regime will be maintained and the NBM intervention in the foreign exchange market would be limited to preventing undue short term fluctuations in the exchange rate and ensuring that official reserves cover the equivalent of 3.5 months of imports of goods and services starting in 2003. Following the sharp real depreciation in 1999 and an initial appreciation in 2000, the real exchange rate vis- &vi, the US dollar is projected to appreciate steadily over the medium term, by 2 to 3 percent per year (year-on-year) as the economy recovers and productivity increases. 12. This scenario also assumes that Moldova will maintain a liberal exchange regime free of restrictions and remain current on all external obligations falling due. In particular, it is assumed that the part of energy arrears currently owed by state-owned companies would be-after a comprehensive audit- rescheduled in 2002. 13. The scenario also provides for stable external inflows of income (compensation of employees) and current transfers (workers’ remittances) in real terms. Foreign direct investment is projected to pick up in 2000 to 10 percent of GDP as a result of exceptional privatization operations in the energy sector and to return to more conservative levels in 200 l- 10 at 5 % percent of GDP per year on average. lo Under this scenario, Moldova will continue to benefit from concessional official bilateral and multilateral support (for a total of about US$80 million per year) and increasing financing from external private creditors at ’ Any privatization proceeds will need to be used to reduce wage and pension arrears and/or retire non-concessional external public debt. 9 The medium-term fiscal deficit of 1 percent is defined as excluding World Bank project loan spending (and financing). The data also exclude expenditures on health and education through the extrabudgetary funds. lo Large privatization operations such as the sale of Moldtelecom are not factored in this scenario. The proceeds of these exceptional operations would be set aside to retire the stock of domestic and external obligations.

All new financing from the World Bank is assumed to be concessional on IDA terms. 14. On the basis of a current account deficit averaging 5.3 percent of GDP over the period 200 1- 10, external debt indicators could be significantly improved over the medium term. The external public and publicly guaranteed debt is projected to increase to around 74.2 percent of GDP in 2001 and to gradually decline over the medium term to 24 percent by 2010 (Table 7). As new highly concessional financing from the World Bank and the IMF becomes available, the improvement in the debt situation would be even more pronounced on a NPV basis. The NPV of future debt service obligations (including financing gaps) would decline from its peak of 70 percent of GDP in 2000 to 16 percent of GDP in 2010. The NPV of debt-to-export and debt-to-revenue ratios are also expected to reach satisfactory levels by 2010, at 32 percent and 86 percent respectively. The debt service on public and publicly guaranteed debt would also decline sharply to less than 10 percent of exports of goods and services by 2007 and about 17 percent of central government revenues by 2010. However, while debt indicators point in the right direction over the long term horizon iiider good policies), the short term situation looks more problematic. The NPV of debt- to-export ratio is projected to remain at above 100 percent in the three coming years and at above 125 percent in 2001-02. In terms of the sustainability of the fiscal position, the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio is projected to exceed 240 percent throughout 2001-03. The year 2002 looks particularly problematic with the bullet repayment of the US$75 million Eurobonds. Accordingly, exceptional sources of financing in the form of World Bank structural adjustment loans and Fund credits will need to be secured to avoid an excessive domestic financing. 16. Overall, in the base case scenario, Moldova is not expected to have a solvency problem as the debt dynamic remains sustainable over the medium term. This reflects that with good policies, a stable external environment, and continued support from the international community, high (but not unrealistic) rates of economic growth could be sustained throughout the decade. In particular, with far-reaching structural reforms, Moldova’s traditional export base (mainly wine and agricultural products) could recover from the slack of 1998-99 to help finance the imports of equipment and other intermediary products necessary to sustain higher output growth. However, in the short run, Moldova is likely to face a liquidity problem. On the basis of the current tax base, and assuming no exceptional revenues (in the form of large privatization proceeds for instance), the fiscal position appears unsustainable in 2002. v. LOW CASE SCENAFUO 17. The baseline scenario (as any scenario) is subject to numerous assumptions regarding the course of future economic developments, starting with the path of economic growth, the size of the current account deficit and the amount of non-debt creating inflows. While the thrust of the analysis would remain broadly the same if both the deficit of the current account Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 58 - APPENDIX VI and the amount of FDI were projected to be higher, the scenario would be different if the virtuous cycle describe above in terms of economic growth would fail to materialize. 18. Accordingly, a low case scenario has been developed to assess the sustainability of Moldova’s external debt under less favorable circumstances affecting export growth. As compared to the base case scenario, it has been assumed that export growth and GDP growth would be 4% percentage and 1 ‘/z percentage point lower throughout the period, respectively. It is also assumed that FDI would be more difficult to attract (1 ‘/z percentage point of GDP lower than in the baseline), productivity gains would be slower, and the real exchange rate would hardly appreciate from the current level. However, in order not to alter too many parameters, the same external inflows of workers’ remittances, current transfers, and official support from bilateral and multilateral creditors were maintained as in the baseline. 19. On the basis of a larger current account deficit than in the base case scenario in earlier years (8.2 percent of GDP on average during 2001-2006 vs. 6.4 percent), debt indicators would worsen over the medium term (Appendix VI, Tables 1 and 2). In particular, the financing gap would be larger than in the baseline scenario, averaging US$63 million per year during 2001-06, compared to US$14 million under the base case. The external public and publicly guaranteed debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to improve but to remain 24 percentage points higher than in the base case by 2010 (at 47 percent). The NPV of this debt (including financing gaps) would decline to 29 percent of GDP by 2010 (vs. 16 percent in the base case). The NPV of debt-to-export and debt-to-revenue ratios are also projected to improve less dramatically, to about 66 percent and 150 percent by 20 10, respectively. The debt service on public and publicly guaranteed debt would decline less sharply than in the baseline to 10 percent of exports of goods and services and about 24 percent of central government revenues by 2010, respectively. 20. As compared to the base case, however, Moldova’s short term difficulties are exacerbated. The NPV of debt-to-export ratio would remain above 100 percent until 2004 (instead of 2003 in the base case). The NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio would not decline below 170 percent before 2009 (vs. 2005 in the base case). As in the base case scenario, in terms of fiscal sustainability, the year 2002 is likely to be the most difficult year. 21. Overall, under a less favorable scenario, Moldova’s liquidity problem that was identified in the base case scenario would be prolonged by several years, making it closer to a solvency problem.

In this memorandum, the government of Moldova and the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) report on the implementation of policies during 2000. Despite a difficult economic environment and the absence of a program supported by the IMF for most of the year, the government and the NBM continued to work closely with IMF staff and successfully implemented policies in line with staff recommendations. The MJZFP describes our objectives and policies for the coming three years and, in particular, our stabilization and reform policies for the first year of our program. In support of our program, we request a three-year arrangement under the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in an amount equivalent to SDR 110.88 million. We request that the Executive Board of the IMF consider our request for an arrangement under the PRGF after the prior actions specified in paragraph 36 of the attached MEFP have been implemented. The government and the NBM are aware that disbursements under the PRGF arrangement are subject to observance of quarterly performance criteria and the completion of semi- annual program reviews, as specified in paragraph 37 of the attached MEFP and in the technical memorandum of understanding attached to the MEFP. We understand that the phasing of disbursements for the second and third year and the establishment of associated conditionality will be established in the context of the second and fourth reviews, respectively. We believe that the policies set out in the MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program. The Government and the NBM, however, are ready to take any additional measures appropriate for this purpose and will consult with the IMF on such matters in accordance with the policies of the IMF. The Government and the NBM will provide the IMF with all the information needed for the IMF to assess progress in implementing the policies and reaching the objectives of our program. In addition to the MEFP, we are pleased to also send you our Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) that has been prepared by the Government as a first and important step to prepare our Poverty Reduction Strategy. We are convinced of the need to make our policies known to the international community and we have already published the I-PRSP on Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - APPENDIX VII the Government’s intemet site.

Introduction 1. Economic performance thus far in 2000 has been relatively good. Financial policies have been appropriately tight and there has been important progress in the area of structural reform, notably with the wineries, the energy sector, and land privatization. Inflation has been on a downward trend, and we expect it to be halved in 2000 (to around 21 percent). The current account deficit, however, is likely to increase in 2000, largely on account of higher imports. Notwithstanding the lack of external financing through most of this period and the significant external debt payments, gross reserves remained virtually unchanged, hovering around 2 % months of imports of goods and services. The exchange rate has also remained broadly stable. Despite good policy implementation, real GDP (which fell by 4 percent in 1999) is expected to remain at the previous year’s level; output in agriculture is expected to drop on account of adverse weather conditions, while production in industry, transport, and construction is picking-up. 2. The government reduced the fiscal deficit (on a commitment basis) by about 6 percentage points of GDP in 1999, to 2.6 percent.’ The budget remained tight in the first three quarters of 2000, with a commitment deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP (on an annual basis). On a cash basis, the deficit was reduced from about 3 l/2 percent of GDP in 1998 to 1.2 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 2000 (on an annual basis), with domestic budgetary arrears (including wages and pensions) falling by Mdl 147 million (or 13 percent of the stock at end- 1999). Revenues have been slightly higher than budgeted, partly because of improved tax collection. Netting operations of the consolidated budget have been reduced and VAT exemptions to the agricultural sector were eliminated in the 2000 budget. A surcharge of US$4/ 1000 cubic meters on gas consumption has also been introduced in the 2000 budget in combination with the issuance of bonds for arrears to our main gas supplier. Importantly, wide-ranging, non-targeted energy privileges were eliminated in the 2000 budget and replaced by a better targeted scheme with the introduction of the Law on Nominal Compensation that limits energy privileges to 9 categories. 3. Monetary policy was tightened in 2000, with reserve money growing by 8 percent in the first half of 2000. Money growth accelerated, however, in the third quarter, reflecting ’ The consolidated government budget includes both local and state budget, and Social Fund. The fiscal data presented in this memorandum exclude project loan disbursements (both in the financing of the budget and the corresponding expenditures above the line). The fiscal data presented here do include, however, the debt service associated with these loans as well as the counterpart funds provided by the government.

After some pressure on the exchange rate in late 1999, largely associated with political uncertainties, the exchange rate of the leu stabilized in early 2000, while the strong inflows in the summer months, aided by the increase in minimum capital requirements for banks, caused the leu to appreciate vis-&vis the U.S. dollar. These events allowed the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) to purchase foreign exchange; gross international reserves increased to US$189 million at end-September (program definition), up from US$l8 1 million at end- 1999. Meanwhile, the NBM has been increasing its use of open market operations (both with repos and outright sales and purchases of treasury bills) to manage bank liquidity, returning to the situation prevailing before the-Russian crisis: the remuneration of reserve requirements was raised to 100 percent of the NBM’s base rate; the level of required reserves was reduced from 15 percent to 13 percent, with required reserves now being held in banks’ correspondent accounts (with reserve averaging permitted) instead of on separate blocked accounts; and the liquid asset ratio requiring banks to invest 5 percent of their assets in treasury bills was eliminated. The NBM continued to implement its policy aimed at banking sector consolidation through a step-wise increase in the minimum capital requirements. 4. Progress in structural reforms, which had been uneven in the years before, markedly improved in 2000. In the energy sector, three electricity distribution companies were sold to a strategic investor, and the sale of two additional distribution companies and the power generation companies is underway. In agriculture, progress continued to be made in liquidating state farms and in distributing land to individual farmers. Bankruptcy or restructuring procedures have been initiated against 57 firms with arrears to the state and social fund budgets (including on credits from the Ministry of Finance) exceeding Mdl 1 million. Moreover, in October, Parliament approved a law allowing for the privatization of five wineries and six tobacco companies through an open tender process. A first important step was also made in strengthening the legal framework with the first reading in parliament of a market-oriented civil code. 1998 Actual 1999 Actual 2000 Estimate 2001 Projection GDP growth (in percent) -6.5 -4.4 0.0 5.0 Inflation (eop, in percent) 18.2 43.8 21.0 10.0 End-period gross official Reserves (in millions of dollars) 140 181 207 257 End-period gross official Reserves (in months of imports) 1.4 2.9 2.7 3.1 External current account balance (in percent of GDP) -16.7 -2.6 -7.9 -6.8 General government balance (in percent of GDP; commitment basis) -8.6 -2.6 -1.5 -1.5 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-65 - APPENDIX VIII II. The Objectives for 2001-2003 5. Over the next three years, the government will continue to implement policies based on the objective of high and sustainable economic growth which is an important prerequisite for poverty reduction. We are aware that to achieve this objective we have to preserve macroeconomic stability, deepen the process of structural reforms, improve governance, and strengthen efforts to attract foreign investment The remainder of this memorandum details the macroeconomic and structural policies for the period ahead. We believe that these policies will be sufficient to achieve the program objectives listed below, but will take additional measures and seek new understandings with the Iw should the program diverge from its specified targets. 6. The government considers that the poverty reduction goal can be achieved only in the context of financial stability accompanied by high and sustainable growth. The medium-term objectives are: annual growth rates of 5 percent or even higher (which requires an increase in non-government investment); a lowering of the public debt burden (including domestic expenditure arrears) to around 70 percent of GDP in 2003 from 92 percent of GDP in 2000 (including a reduction in the stock of external public and publicly guaranteed debt from 75 percent of GDP in 2000 to around 60 percent of GDP in 2003); a further reduction in the annual inflation rate to about 10 percent (end of period); and containing the external current account deficit to around 6 percent of GDP. 7. To achieve the medium-term objectives, the government will continue to implement a prudent fiscal policy. In particular, it will be important to aim at a primary budget surplus of at least 2 percent of GDP over the medium-term to reduce the debt burden and avoid crowding-out private investments. This implies an overall fiscal deficit of less than 2 percent of GDP. At the same time, the budget allocation for the social sectors will be consistent with the poverty reduction strategy. The government will also give a further impetus to the structural reform programs through more vigorous efforts to strengthen the legal framework, restructure/liquidate firms with large debt to the budget, complete the privatization program (including wineries, energy and telecommunication companies), strengthen the market for agricultural land, achieve additional public administration reform and further deregulation. We will also be working closely with the World Bank in these areas in order to attain our growth objectives. 8. To better focus our policies toward poverty alleviation, we are preparing a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, which will be incorporated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) to be approved by the government by early 2002. This strategy will build upon the work already done in this area-undertaken in the context of policies developed with the assistance from the World Bank, UNDP, and other international organizations and bilateral donors. To strengthen the effectiveness and public support of our poverty-alleviating policies, we will organize a broad consultative process that will include representatives of civil society groups, local communities, and foreign donors. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 66 - APPENDIX VIII 9. The steps for arriving at a full-fledged PRSP are described in our interim PRSP, approved by the government in November 2000. Thisdocument describes Moldova’s poverty profile, reviews policies implemented over the past few years to strengthen the economy and reduce poverty, sets out the medium-term economic scenario on which the program is based, and indicates the key elements of a poverty reduction strategy. The interim paper also specifies the institutional framework and consultative process that will be used to prepare the strategy, the poverty reduction targets, and a timetable for its preparation. A matrix of objectives and measures that the government intends to implement in the next three years has also been prepared. III. The Program for 2001 A. Objectives 10. Macroeconomic policies for 2001 will aim at supporting a turnaround in GDP as well as reducing inflation and maintaining a prudent level of official reserves. To achieve the growth target of about 5 percent, we intend to proceed rapidly with structural reforms, improve governance, and implement the privatization process as described below. While there are downside risks for the targeted growth rate in 2001, the implementation of structural reforms, including the privatization program, a post privatization plan for agriculture, the initiation of public administration reform, and a strengthening of the legal framework, as well as an improvement in the external environment, are expected to contribute to the turnaround in GDP in 200 1. Inflation is targeted to further decline to about 10 percent (end of year basis) in line with the tight financial policies. External reserves are expected to increase to over 3 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services. B. Fiscal policy 11. The 2001 budget, passed by parliament by early December (prior action), aims at stabilizing Moldova’s total stock of public and publicly guaranteed debt at around 74 percent of GDP through achieving a sizeable primary surplus of 4 percent of GDP. The overall cash deficit for the consolidated government is budgeted at Mdl400 million (1.9 percent of GDP) with domestic budgetary arrears (including wages and pensions) budgeted to further decline by Mdl 100 million, resulting in an expected deficit on a commitment basis of Mdl300 million (1.5 percent of GDP). The deficit target shows our commitment to fiscal prudence and our determination to further strengthen public finances and reduce the debt burden. The budget features measures to increase tax revenues to 22 percent of GDP. Expenditures will decline slightly as a share of GDP despite the large interest payments and the further reduction of domestic expenditure arrears. At the same time, the share of expenditure on education and health care is budgeted to increase. As a result of our ambitious, large-scale privatization program, involving the energy, and telecommunication sectors, we expect sizeable, but as yet unquantifiable, proceeds to be available to the budget. Accordingly, the budget assumes for a low amount of privatization proceeds. All privatization proceeds will be allocated to the budget and any privatization proceeds received during the year in addition to the amounts included in the 2001 budget will be used to reduce Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 67 - APPENDIX VIII domestic budgetary expenditure arrears (including on wages and pensions) and public external and domestic debt, including credit to the go;ernment from the NBM, or reserved for debt service in later years, in proportions to be determined in consultation with Fund staff. 12. Despite the recent improvements in tax performance, we are aware that further progress is required to meet the ambitious revenue target for 2001. Accordingly, netting- out operations will be reduced to 3 percent of total revenues of the combined state and local governments, down from 5 percent in 2000 and 10 percent in 1999 (except for those involving debt clearing operations with the Social Fund). Moreover, we will resist all calls for new laws to provide for tax exemptions, holidays, amnesties, or deferrals of any kind. As regards the Free Economic Zones (FEZs), we will draft a new law with technical assistance from the Fund that will restrict the zones to export-oriented production and trans-shipment. The intention will be to strictly limit privileges and, ultimately, to phase out the FEZs. We will submit such a draft, together with other necessary legislative changes, to parliament by end-February, 200 1 (structural benchmark). We will also analyze the appropriateness of a presumptive tax on small enterprises to draw new private business into the tax net, with a view to introducing a presumptive tax in 2003. As regards personal income taxation, while the monthly exemption threshold will be maintained at Mdl210, the taxable income brackets will be raised in line with inflation. A 10 percent tax will be levied on annual income up to Mdl 12,180, a 15 percent tax will be levied on annual income between Mdl 12,180 and Mdl 16,200, and a 28 percent tax will be levied on annual income greater than Mdl 16,200. Corporate income tax rates are budgeted to remain unchanged in 200 1. An excise of Mdl 1200 per MT will continue to be levied on gasoline imports and an excise of Mdl500 per MT will be levied on diesel imports. Excises on alcohol will be adjusted annually in line with inflation. Excise rates on tobacco products, which are low by international standards, will be increased gradually up to the levels prevailing in other transition countries with comparable economic conditions. Cigarette excise stamps will be required as of April 1,200 1. The excise tax on exported non-fermented tobacco has been eliminated in the 2001 budget. To avoid the corrosion of non-tax revenues such as user charges and fees by inflation, a number of those that generate the most revenues will be raised in nominal terms (including fees on patents, land improvement, licenses and fines applied by the State Tax Inspectorate). Measures will also be taken to tax enterprises that are currently outside the tax net. We intend to discuss our tax policy during the mid-term review to assess the possibility of lowering tax and excise rates if the fiscal position permits. 13. In the area of tax administration, the following measures will be implemented: With the assistance of USAID, we have been working on introducing a modem tax administration system that conforms to best international practices and should significantly improve tax compliance. Parliament has already approved Title 4 (excise chapter) and Title 6 (local property tax chapter). By end March 200 1, we expect it to approve Title 5 (tax administration chapter), a structural benchmark, and, by end-2001, we expect it to approve the chapter on local taxes and fees as well as the law on valuation of real estate property and the property valuation method. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 68 - APPENDIX VIII The large taxpayer unit (LTU) will be reorganized in order to make it a full fledged unit in line with technical assistance advise provided by the IMF. A pilot project on the LTU has been established in the Chisinau municipality as a first step towards the implementation of a fully-fledged LTU for all regions (prior action). A decree for this purpose was issued on July 24,200O and the pilot LTU became operational on December 1,200O. We will develop a comprehensive collection enforcement program and a reporting system for the State Tax Inspectorate (STI) to monitor the collection of arrears at all levels of the tax administration. We will also develop an audit strategy for the ST1 that includes improved coverage of taxpayers, automation and audit selection techniques, as well as more comprehensive audit methods. We will amend the tax code to incorporate all VAT measures that are in force and avoid annual VAT legislation changes through the budget laws and we will increase the VAT registration threshold to Mdl 100,000 in 2002 in order to reduce the number of small tax payers and improve the administration of VAT. 14. We will also improve customs administration. In this regard, a new customs code was approved by parliament which was developed with the assistance of the EU and US Customs Service. The new code, based on EU standards, will provide the basis for improved revenue collection, better service to the trading sector, and more effective enforcement; and a pre-shipment inspection (PSI) program, in line with Fund technical assistance recommendations, is being implemented, while resources are being redeployed to vulnerable areas that were not strengthened by the PSI. 15. As regards expenditures, public sector salaries, which had been kept unchanged in nominal terms from 1995 through 1999, are budgeted to increase by Md183 million in 2001 (after increasing by 30 percent in 2000) as a result of the increase in the minimum wage to Mdl 100 per month, from Md165 in 2000. This has been made possible in part by the large cuts in public sector employment which fell from 309,000 in 1999 to nearly 285,000 in 2000. Further reorganization of the public administration is expected in 2001 and beyond in line with the World Bank’s Public Sector Reform project. We will refrain from securitizing the outstanding stock of wage and pension arrears. 16. Spending on health and education is budgeted to increase in real terms in 200 1. But, at the same time, we recognize the need to streamline and rationalize expenditure on social outlays. In education, the key measures include raising the student-teacher ratio closer to international norms, reducing the teaching week to five days in schools and other educational institutions, reducing the number of non-teaching staff, and introducing partial user charges for meals and accommodation. Expenditure on health are also being rationalized, without a loss of essential services, by eliminating underutilized hospital beds, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 69 - APPENDIX VIII improving the calculation method for allocating budget funds, improving medical services to provide a minimum standard of basic services, and continuing the partial hiring freeze. This much needed rationalization of education and health follows recommendations made by a Fund technical assistance mission in mid- 1998 as well as efforts under the World Bank Public Sector Reform project and Education and Health Reform projects. 17. To improve the effectiveness of public spending, we remain committed to limiting subsidies in the budget. Direct subsidies to the agricultural sector in 2001 will be limited to the spending amount allocated in the 2000 budget for the Agricultural Support Fund (ASF). Funds available within the spending limit will be targeted to rural entrepreneurs and farmers through a matching grant credit fund developed in agreement with the World Bank. In addition, we have already taken measures to better target energy compensations. In 2000, parliament and the president passed legislation eliminating various privileges and introducing targeted benefits that will cost Md1225 million in 200 1. For the current winter season, if grant funds become available, resources additional to those committed by the Law on Nominal Compensations will be allocated for heating compensations to a new category of pensioners: those whose pensions do not exceed Mdl 150 per month. Any remaining funds will be used to increase the discount, for the current heating season, for the categories already covered under the Law on Nominal Compensations. 18. We recognize that the structural imbalances of the payments made through the Social Fund remain large, and further work is needed to improve the efficiency of its operations. We are working with the World Bank to rationalize targeting of social spending (including on social assistance expenditure) and to design adequate social safety net measures. The administrative costs of the National Insurance House will also be reduced and there will be no increase in social security contributions (employer or employee) in 2001. The minimum contribution rate applied in the case of the self-employed and farmers will be increased in real terms while maintaining the existing system based on plot size for the latter. In the event of significantly higher-than-expected revenue collection from the Social Fund become available, we will decide, in consultation with Fund staff, on its allocation for social purposes. 19. The Laws on Public and Private Pensions are being actively implemented with a view to strengthening the financial position of the Social Fund and improving the actuarial balance of the National Pension Fund. We are continuing to work with the World Bank to implement these changes and to improve the targeting and efficiency of social protection services under the Social Protection Management and the Public Sector Reform Credits. Since 1997, all cash collection operations of the Social Fund have been undertaken by the State Tax Inspectorate of the Ministry of Finance. This has materially improved compliance and cash revenue performance. As of the adoption of the 2001 budget, in-kind payments to the Social Fund are accepted only for clearance of historic debts incurred before January 1, 2000, up to a maximum of 50 percent. These in-kind receipts will be sold at market prices. The Social Fund will not accept real estate as in-kind collection in 2001 for the purpose of debt settlement, except in connection with the restructuring of agricultural enterprises until end-June 2001 in accordance with the Law on Bankruptcy; in-kind collections will be Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7o- APPENDIX VIII restricted to agricultural products, foodstuffs, and communal services. We are also cognizant of the need to improve transparency in Social Fund operations. To this end, monthly cash flow reports will be issued in 2001 and the Social Fund will explicitly include the arrears of the State budget. 20. We are also continuing our program to improve the management of public finances. All existing extra-budgetary funds will be consolidated for presentational purposes for Fund use beginning in 2001 and we will study further possible ways to improve fiscal transparency and to provide a comprehensive assessment of fiscal policy. In 2000, we extended the coverage of the treasury system to local government revenues. In 2001, we will extend the treasury system to cover all local government spending as well, starting with 2 regions by end-March 2001 and all remaining regions by end-July 2001 (structural benchmark). Also in 2001, to improve the forecasting of cash flows and operational cash management and with technical assistance from the World Bank, we will establish a Cash Management Unit in the Treasury. Furthermore, we will continue to strengthen public expenditure management and control with technical assistance from the World Bank by registering all expenditure commitments (including contracts for the supply of goods and services) and by establishing cash spending ceilings for the spending units. These ceilings will be reviewed and adjusted as necessary. 21. The Administrative and Territorial Reform Law has been implemented. The number of local administrations have been reduced from 38 to 12 and the number of public sector employees has been cut by almost 10,000. Savings are also being utilized in non-wage expenditures as the new structures are progressively being put in place. We remain firmly committed to refrain from directing credits through the NBM or commercial banks, or instruct banks to extend credits on non-commercial terms, including to local administrations and the Social Fund. The ST1 management of debtors has also been strengthened and we are implementing a strategy to recover funds from defaulters on government guarantees and firms with large arrears to the state through bankruptcy and restructuring procedures (see below). C. Monetary Policies and financial sector reforms 22. Monetary policy of the NBM will continue to be directed at achieving low inflation. Monetary policy will be aimed at limiting inflation to about 20 percent in 2000 (year-end) and a further reduction in inflation to 10 percent by end-200 1. Within the context of a floating exchange rate regime, the NBM has adopted reserve money as its intermediate policy target for the conduct of monetary policy. The NBM’s monetary program aims at limiting reserve money growth to 3 1 percent in 2000 and to 17 percent in 2001. The monetary program furthermore aims at maintaining a level of gross international reserves equivalent to over 2% months of imports by end-2000 and to increase reserves to over 3 months of import coverage by end-200 1. The program for 200 1 envisages a modest increase in (net) central bank credit to the government by Mdl 50 million, and is consistent with an increase in real credit to the economy. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7l- APPENDIX VIII 23. The NBM will further increase its use of market based instruments in the conduct of monetary policy. The NBM intends to gradually reduce reserve requirements if and when price and monetary developments permit, in close consultation with Fund staff. The NBM alsointends to conduct a more active interest rate policy to signal its policy intentions. In this context, the Lombard facility will be adjusted to provide very-short-term credit only, with rates at a sufficiently high penalty level. To facilitate a greater use of open market operations in treasury bills, the stock of central bank credits to the government that has not yet been converted into treasury bills will be steadily converted. In 2001, an additional Mdl 39.3 million of government credits will be converted into treasury bills. The NBM will continue to refrain from extending direct or directed credits to enterprises. 24. The government is aware of the danger of decapitalizing the NBM through excessive profit transfers and the 2001 Budget Law provides for the continuation of an ex- post profit transfer mechanism. In particular, interim profit transfers will be made at most once per quarter and will be based on a conservative calculation of realized net profits of the NBM. Thus, quarterly profit transfers for the first three quarters of a year will be limited to 90 percent of net realized profits, that is, after deduction of operational expenses, reserve fund and loan provisioning and unrealized losses due to movements in exchange rates and prices of securities. The profit transfer for the fourth quarter will be limited to 50 percent of realized net profits, and a final profit transfer for the year will be made only after the completion of an external audit of the NBM’s books and in accordance with the NBM law. External audits by a reputable international accounting firm will continue to be conducted annually. 25. The NBM will continue to support the consolidation of the banking system, which is expected as consequence of the further increase in the minimal capital requirement effective December 3 1,200O. The NBM will also continue to strengthen banking supervision and enforcement of prudential regulations, including removal of management, bank license withdrawals, and the encouragement of mergers of banks not in compliance with minimum capital requirements. In this regard, we have revoked the license of 8 insolvent banks since 1996. The commercial bank(s) that will deal with all treasury operations of the state (including local governments) will continue to be chosen in a competitive, transparent way and in accordance with the law on the National Bank of Moldova. 26. The situation at the Savings Bank is under careful continuous review following the government’s take-over of the bank and the installation of new management in March 1999. The rehabilitation plan is being actively implemented and the bank has achieved a positive net worth. It is expected that the bank can be largely recapitalized by a further recovery of assets and efficiency gains in 2001 without any government capital injections. The government will prepare a plan for the privatization of the Savings Bank. 27. While a properly financed and structured deposit insurance scheme can build confidence in the banking system, we believe that the present environment is not conducive to the introduction of deposit insurance and we will not introduce such a scheme in the near Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 72 - APPENDIX VIII future until a sufficient degree of bank consolidation in the sector and higher capitalization has been achieved, and after consulting with Fund staff. D. Structural reforms and privatization 28. The structural reform agenda under the program will focus on measures that will contribute to the restoration of growth, an important prerequisite for poverty alleviation. In addition to public sector, agriculture, and energy sector reforms that will be implemented with the assistance of the World Bank under its prospective lending operations (PPSAC and PSRC), our structural reform agenda in the context of the PRGF supported program will focus on the following: 29. Privatization program. The privatization bill on five wineries and the tobacco sector was approved by Parliament in October 2000 (prior action). In the coming period, and according to a strategy to be agreed to with the World Bank, we will prepare the privatization of these wineries and tobacco companies. We expect to be able to announce a sales tender for at least two wineries by May 1,200 1. We also plan to proceed with the privatization of Moldtelecom, in consultation with the World Bank. In this regard, Parliament has already approved an independent regulatory agency for the telecommunication sector, appointed a board of directors and physically established the agency. Moldtelecom has not contracted any external debt since May 1999 and will not be permitted to contract debt pending its privatization, except for making necessary pre-privatization investments in agreement with the World Bank. We will launch a tender for selecting a financial advisor for the privatization of Moldtelecom by February 1,200l (structural benchmark). 30. Bankruptcy/reorganization procedures against 24 loss-making firms with arrears to the State and/or Social Fund budgets exceeding Md13 million have already been initiated (prior action) (Table 2). Creditors have filed legal proceedings against these companies. We intend to put increased pressure on these and other enterprises undergoing reorganization through the creditor council’s authority under the Law on Bankruptcy. However, the Law on Bankruptcy will need to be amended to accelerate the reorganization/liquidation process. We will submit an amended law to parliament by February 15,200l (structural benchmark) and expect its approval by May 1, 2001. This should contribute to financial discipline (i.e., through a demonstration effect), a reduction of tax arrears, and the promotion of efficiency and growth. 31. Strengthening legal and regulatory framework. We are continuing our efforts to establish a firm legal framework for a market economy, a key component to providing a business friendly environment and to improving transparency and good governance. In this regard, the first reading of the civil code-which is indispensable to regulate contractual relations-was approved by parliament in October; we expect the civil code to be approved by end-June 200 1. We recognize that the liquidation of insolvent banks, after their license has been revoked, has placed a heavy burden on the NBM, absorbing a large number of staff and hampering the supervision of other banks. The NBM will submit by end-March 2001 amendments to the Law on Financial Institutions and other related laws to parliament to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 73 - APPENDIX VIII transfer the responsibility for appointing bank liquidators and monitoring progress of the liquidation process to the courts (structural benchmark). Moreover, the government will also submit an amended law on collateral and to parliament by end-March 200 1, to allow for an easier enforcement of property rights and contractual obligations. In the area of improving governance and transparency, we intend to submit, with assistance from the Fund, a draft law on financial disclosure to parliament by end-June 2001 (structural benchmark), requiring regular reporting by senior elected and appointed government officials. 32. Moldova is an agricultural economy which exports much of its output unprocessed. In order to generate an increased level of exports, we think it is important to reduce the shadow economy, improve the business environment, and take all possible measures to foster foreign and domestic investment in agriculture and, in particular, agro-processing. Accordingly, we will work with the World Bank to reduce barriers to economic activity, and to identify technical assistance for the development of a strategy for foreign direct investment and export promotion. E. External sector issues 33. Given Moldova’s vulnerability to external shocks, we recognize that it is in the country’s best interest to maintain a floating exchange rate regime. Interventions by the NBM in the foreign exchange market will continue to be limited to smoothing out short-term fluctuations and to meeting reserve targets. In addition, we will continue our liberal and transparent trade and exchange policies and maintain a relatively low level of tariff protection. In this context, we have eliminated the ban on the export of cereals that had been prompted by the drought earlier this year (prior action). We hope to complete the negotiations on WTO accessions in the coming months. Furthermore, we will not impose or intensify any exchange restrictions, introduce any multiple currency practices, or conclude any bilateral payment agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, or introduce or intensify any import restrictions for balance of payment purposes. In this regard, we will refrain from raising the average import tariff from the 1999 level and from introducing an import surcharge, and we will maintain the maximum import tariff rate at 15 percent (structural benchmark). 34. Moldova’s external debt has risen sharply since the start of the transition process and debt service obligations have been very high in recent years and will remain so in the period ahead. Moldova has gone at great length, however, to remain current on its obligations (although there have been a few instances of (temporary) payment arrears) and to regularize our relations with our creditors, and we will continue to do so. In addition, we will continue to work with our creditors on the possibilities for rescheduling of our debts. In this context, we have requested the assistance of the Dutch government to organize, in cooperation with the World Bank, a Consultative Group meeting to be held in early 2001, to mobilize additional donor support. To prevent a further increase in our debt burden, the government and the NBM will refrain from contracting non-concessional debt and also refrain from issuing guarantees on non-concessional terms for commercial ventures, whether state-owned or private. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 74 - APPENDIX VIII 35. Privatization of the energy sector has resulted in a large stock of unresolved (external) debts, some of which may ultimately need to be assumed by the Republic of Moldova. We intend to address this problem in a systematic manner, using market-based mechanisms, and taking into account comparability of treatment principles. The energy debts will be audited by a reputable international accounting firm. To this end, we are requesting technical assistance from the Fund and the World Bank to help us define the problem and develop a strategy to solve it. In the meantime, the government and the NBM will not take upon themselves any debts of Moldovagas, Moldtranslectro, or any other commercial venture, whether state-owned or private. F. Prior Actions 36. As noted above, we will take the following prior actions before the IMF Executive Board considers our request for an arrangement under the PRGF: 0 A budget for 2001 will be adopted that is consistent with IMF recommendations. a The draft chapters of the new Tax Code on excises and local property taxes will be promulgated into law. l We will establish a pilot project for a full-fledged Large Taxpayer Unit for the Chisinau region. l We will eliminate restrictions on grain exports. 0 Legislation will be adopted that allows the effective privatization of five strategic wineries through an open tender process. l We will initiate bankruptcy or reorganization procedures against at least 24 enterprises with arrears to the budget of more than Md13 million, G. Program monitoring and reporting requirements 37. Program monitoring will be carried out on the basis of quarterly quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks established for the period October 1,2000- September 30,200 1, with semi-annual reviews based on performance as of end-March 200 1 and end-September 2001. Quantitative performance criteria have been set for December 3 1, 2000 and March 3 1, 200 1 and indicative targets for the remainder of the first year program; performance criteria for the remainder of the first year program will be set in the context of the first review. The quantitative performance criteria include (i) a floor on the net international reserves (NIR) of the NBM; (ii) a ceiling on reserve money of the NBM; (iii) a ceiling on net credit to the general government from the NBM; (iv) a ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing by the government, the NBM or any other agency acting on behalf of the government of new non-concessional medium- and long-term external debt with Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 75 - APPENDIX VIII original maturities longer than 1 year, with a sub-ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new non-concessional external debt in the maturity range of l-5 years; (v) a ceiling on the net disbursement of short-term external public and publicly guaranteed debt, with the exception of normal import-related credits; (vi) a ceiling on the cash deficit of the general government; and (vii) a ceiling on the stock of overall domestic expenditure arrears of the general government. In addition, there is also a continuous performance criterion on the non- accumulation of external payment arrears by the government and the NBM. Indicative targets have been set for: (i) the net domestic assets of the NBM; (ii) gross international reserves of the NBM; and (iii) general government arrears on wages and pensions. Details on the levels, definition, monitoring (and adjustors) of quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets are set in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (attachment I to this Memorandum). The structural benchmarks under the program are summarized in Table 1. All data necessary for the effective monitoring of the program will be reported in a timely manner to the Fund by the Ministry of Finance and the NBM.

For program monitoring purposes, gross reserves of the NBM are defined as monetary gold, holdings of SDRs, reserve position in the Fund, and holdings of foreign exchange in convertible currencies that are readily available, including holdings of securities denominated in convertible currencies issues by governments or central banks of OECD member states. Excluded from reserve assets are capital subscriptions to foreign financial institutions, long-term nonfinancial assets, funds disbursed by the World Bank assigned for onlending and project implementation, assets in nonconvertible currencies, foreign assets pledged as collateral or otherwise encumbered, and interest accrued on reserve liabilities. Reserve liabilities in convertible currencies are defined as use of Fund credit, and convertible currency liabilities of the NBM to nonresidents with an original maturity of up to and including one year. Excluded from reserve liabilities are liabilities with original maturities longer than one year. For program monitoring purposes, U.S. dollar denominated components of the NBM balance sheet will be valued at the program exchange rate. The program exchange rate of the Moldova leu to the U.S. dollar has been set at Mdl. 12.2584/$ and the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the SDR dollar has been set at $1.29789/SDR (being the prevailing exchange rates at September 29,200O).

Limits on the Contracting and Guaranteeing of Nonconcessional External Debt with Original Maturities Indicated Below by the Government of Moldova, the NBM or any other Agency Acting on Behalf of the Government, and on the Accumulation of External Arrears (In millions of U.S. dollars) Maximum Limits (Performance criteria) Maturity Subceiling 1 yearor Overlyear- Over 5 years less under 5 years Cumulative change from September 30,200O December 31,200O 0 0 14 March 31,200l 0 0 14 June 30,200l (indicative) 0 0 14 September 30,200l (indicative) 0 0 14 Definitions The term debt will has the meaning set forth in Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24,200O. In this regard, debt is understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and offkial swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contract where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the program, the debt under item (iii) is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 86 - ATTACHMENT I period of the arrangement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property. Under the definition of debt above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition will not give rise to debt. This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined above, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. For purpose of the program, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of the government or the NBM or any other agency acting on behalf of the government to service such a debt in the event of nonpayment by the recipient. Government is defined as the Republic of Moldova and the NBM, but does not include any government-owned entity with separate legal personality other than the NBM. Concessionality will be calculated using currency-specific discount rates based on the OECD commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs). The ten-year average of CIRRs will be used as the discount rate to assess the concessionality of loans of an original maturity of at least 15 years, and a six-month average of CIRRs will be used to asses the concessionality of loans with original maturities of less than 15 years. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the following margins will be added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent for 15-19 years; 1.15 percent for 20-30 years; and 1.25 percent for over 30 years. Under this definition, only loans with a grant element equivalent to 35 percent or more will be excluded from the borrowing limits. The debt limits will not apply to loans classified as international reserve liabilities of the NBM. External-debt limits apply to the net disbursement of short term external debt (with an original maturity of up to and including one year) and contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional medium- and long-term debt with original maturities of more than one year, with sublimits on the contracting or guaranteeing of such debt with original maturities of up to and including five years. Short term debt includes all short term obligations, excluding reserve liabilities of the NBM and import trade credits. Short term debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar shall be valued in U.S. dollar at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of disbursement. Medium and long term debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of contracting or guaranteeing. The limits allow for the disbursement of an already ageed upon 10 year Euro 15 million loan from the European Union in late 2000 or early 2001. The government undertakes not to accumulate payment arrears on external debt with original maturity of more than one year contracted or guaranteed by the government (including debt converted into government debt). Payment arrears are payments due (following the expiration of any applicable grace period) but unpaid.
