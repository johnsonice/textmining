Introduction and Summary of Issues The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Norway were held in Oslo during November 1-8, 1995. The staff team u met Minister of Finance Johnsen, then Norges Bank Governor Moland, other senior officials, and representatives of employers, trade unions, and the banking community. Mr. Bergo (Executive Director) attended some of the meetings as an observer. Norway has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4. In concluding the last Article IV consultation (EBM/95/13, 2/13/95), Directors welcomed Norway's favorable economic performance. They recommended further fiscal consolidation, both to keep demand pressures in check and to strengthen the public finances ahead of the long-term decline in petroleum revenues and aging of the population. Directors also encouraged the authorities to address structural problems associated with Norway's high levels of protection, subsidies, and transfers and large public sector. Directors considered that the authorities' monetary policy guidelines had worked well so far, and most did not believe that announcing a quantified inflation target would add clarity to their implementation. The economy has continued to perform well during the past year, weathering a period of uncertainty associated with the November 1994 referendum, in which EU membership was rejected. In line with Directors' advice, the authorities have introduced additional fiscal consolidation measures, and are developing a framework for addressing the longer-term fiscal imbalance. Monetary policy has successfully maintained its focus on exchange rate stability against European currencies, and inflation has remained low. This year's consultation discussions focused on (i) whether policies are sufficiently tight to forestall inflationary pressures that could arise as the upswing continues; and (ii) the policy requirements-- financial and structural--for the long-term transition to a post-oil economy. The coverage, frequency, and timeliness of data provided by Norway to the Fund are adequate for effective surveillance (Appendix I). II. Economic Background 1. Overview The challenges for Norway have increasingly become those associated with abundance. Petroleum wealth has risen further thanks to improvements in extraction technology and new oil and gas discoveries; and, after a prolonged downturn that followed financial deregulation, overheating, and the mid-1980s oil price collapse, the last three years have seen a strong and increasingly broad-based upturn (Chart 1). Wage increases have nevertheless remained moderate and with other cost pressures also subdued, inflation has been modest (Chart 2). The external current account surplus has expanded, driven by continued growth of oil and gas exports. L/ The team comprised Messrs. Fetherston, Arnason, Ordoobadi, and Ms. Lim (all EUl).

During the initial expansion of petroleum production in the 1970s (Chart 3), manufacturing competitiveness was eroded by high inflation induced by the use of increasing petroleum revenues mainly to finance domestic--and in particular public-- expenditure. u Consequently, manufacturing output and employment shrank while public sector employment expanded to 30 percent of total (second only to Sweden in the industrial world), and subsidies and household transfers rose to over a quarter of GDP. At the same time, the tax burden on the mainland economy remains among the highest in the OECD. Oil and gas production now contributes over 12 percent of GDP and a third of Norway's exports, and Norway has recently become the world's second largest oil exporter. Macroeconomic policies are geared to promoting economic stability and improved competitiveness under the so-called "solidarity alternative" agreed by the social partners. Under this approach, wage bargainers deliver moderate wage growth on the understanding that a policy of exchange rate stability will deliver low inflation. With monetary policy thus assigned to the exchange rate, the authorities have sought to stabilize domestic demand through fiscal policy, which since 1994 has been moderately restrictive. 2. Recent develoDments This policy strategy has delivered favorable results. For 1995, growth of mainland outout and GDP are estimated at 3L percent and 4 percent, respectively, and the significant output gap that had emerged in the early 1990s (estimated at close to 4 percent of mainland GDP) has now been closed. Private consumption growth exceeded 3 percent in 1995, with consumers rebuilding stocks of durable goods that had been depleted during the earlier downturn. Growth of housing investment has moderated, but manufacturing investment has shot up (albeit from a low level) by over 30 percent. Emnlovment has grown strongly (3% percent during 1994-95), allowing unemplovment to decline from its 1993 peak of 6 percent to just under 5 percent currently despite rising labor force participation (see Chart 2). An additional 2-2% percent of the labor force are enrolled in active labor market programs, which had been expanded in the downturn. Consumer price inflation rose from only 1.4 percent in 1994 (a thirty- year low) to 2.5 percent in 1995, largely reflecting indirect tax increases. The inflation rate slowed to 2.3 percent in November 1995; excluding the effects of the tax increases, inflation has been just below 2 percent in recent months. Wage increases have remained modest at about 3 percent. JJ Between 1970 and 1988, relative unit labor costs in Norwegian manufacturing rose by close to 40 percent, bringing them on average to about 20 percent above those of trading partners. Most of the deterioration in relative costs occurred during the 1970s. An improvement in manufacturing competitiveness after 1988 was subsequently reversed (see below).

Norway became a net creditor to the rest of the world in late 1995. The counterpart of the surplus has been a reduction in foreign indebtedness of the government, business, and financial sectors. The current framework for fiscal nolicv was set out in 1993 in the Government's Long-Term Program for 1994-97. Under this program, growth of spending was to be kept below that of mainland output and the tax system left broadly unchanged following a major-reform in the early 1990s. Subsequent budgets incorporated tightening equivalent to 1% percent of GDP in 1994 and a further 1 percent of GDP in 1995; the latter included the effects of additional measures equivalent to % percent of GDP to boost confidence in the wake of the rejection of EU membership in November 1994. Together with the effects of the cyclical upswing and higher net petroleum revenues, the state budget deficit consequently declined from 5% percent of GDP in 1993 to under % percent of GDP in 1995 (Chart 5). l.J Under guidelines adopted in May 1994, monetarv colicv is geared to keeping the exchange rate of the krone stable against European currencies, i.e., within a range about 3-5 percent below the rate at which it had been linked to the ECU until late 1992 (Chart 6). 2J Norges Bank has intermittently intervened in the foreign exchange market in order to smooth exchange rate developments, notably in the period surrounding the RU referendum. In 1995, Norges Bank has been a small net purchaser of foreign exchange. 2/ In nominal effective terms, the krone has appreciated by 4 percent since early 1994. Along with sluggish productivity growth, this has led to a real effective appreciation of over 7 percent, largely reversing the competitiveness gains recorded during 1989-93. Reflecting also cyclical factors, growth of traditional exports slowed from 13 percent in 1994 to about 4 percent in 1995. k/ JJ According to staff estimates (detailed in SM/95/17, l/26/95 Appendix II) the structural fiscal balance shifted from a surplus of about 4 percent of potential mainland output in the late 1980s to a deficit of similar magnitude by 1993, and then narrowed to about 2 percent in 1995. 2J Norway's exchange rate experience since the delinking from the ECU is reviewed in the background paper. 3J Since early 1993, Norges Bank has maintained a relatively high reserve position equivalent to approximately six months of imports of goods and services. 4/ Norway's traditional exports are concentrated on products such as metals, pulp, and paper, the prices and volumes of which respond early to the international economic cycle. Export profitability has thus benefitted from the recent cyclical upswing in international prices of these products, which offset the deterioration in relative labor costs.

Over the last few years, Norwegian interest rates have typically been somewhat under the European average but higher than German rates (Chart 8). Norges Bank has left official short-term interest rates (an overnight lending rate of 6.75 percent and a deposit rate of 4.75 percent) unchanged since early 1994, but has used its policy instruments, subject to the constraints implied by the framework for exchange rate policy, to influence the movement of market rates within this band and keep monetary conditions tight. As a result, the short-term interest rate differential over Germany widened from near zero at the beginning of 1995 to 150 basis points in early 1996. In contrast, the long-term differential has narrowed in recent months to below 40 basis points. The growth of monetary aggregates has remained moderate, with the 12-month growth of M2 and domestic credit at 6.2 percent and 5 percent, respectively, at end-October. 3. Economic outlook Growth of mainland output is officially projected to moderate to 2% percent in 1996 (Table l), partly in response to the further fiscal tightening announced in the 1996 budget (see below). GDP growth is projected at over 4 percent, reflecting higher petroleum production. l.J The unemployment rate is expected to ease to 4% percent, with inflation averaging 2 percent. The external current account surplus is projected to expand further to 5 percent of GDP. Over the medium-term, the authorities envisage that the growth of the mainland economy will settle down to potential (2% percent). With the expansion of the petroleum sector expected to slow, the growth of GDP is projected to converge on the mainland growth rate. Inflation is expected to remain low and the current account to stay in healthy surplus. 2J While the main external risk to the short-term forecast is a possible slowdown of the international economy, the domestic risks are on the upside. The most important of these risks relate to wage and consumption growth. Wages have increased only modestly in recent years while the profitability of firms has recovered significantly in the upswing, and with the authorities' projections implying output rising somewhat above potential there is the possibility of higher settlements in the early 1996 wage round and of increasing wage drift. Furthermore, with the finances of the banking system having been restored since the 1991 banking crisis, credit availability would not be a constraint on consumption growth. I/ As Chart 3 shows, estimates of petroleum production for the next few years have again been revised up. The authorities explained that the significant revisions over the past year reflected an initiative to develop more realistic estimates that they hoped would be less prone to change in future. u Additional details on the medium-term outlook are presented in the background paper.

Policy Discussions The discussions focused on policy challenges facing the authorities for both the short and long term. The first is to avoid overheating that would be likely to develop if output growth remains above that of potential. The second is to prepare for the eventual long-term decline in petroleum revenue and the aging of the population-- developments projected to affect the budget adversely by more than 10 percent of GDP by 2030 (Box 1). The staff emphasized that the latter task entails not only the accumulation and prudent investment of large fiscal surpluses while oil revenues remain large, but also structural policies to establish a flexible and competitive economy for the post-oil era. 1. Fiscal nolicv The authorities explained that fiscal policy was geared to containing demand pressures and setting aside sufficient resources for the long term. Within this framework, the 1996 budget (proposed in October and finalized in early December) continues the moderately restrictive fiscal stance of recent years. Essentially through continued expenditure restraint, the budget is projected to withdraw stimulus equivalent to % percent of GDP in 1996, following the cumulative withdrawal of 2% percent of GDP during 1994-95. Consequently, the state budget-- to which net petroleum revenues contribute about 5 percent of GDP-- is projected to record a surplus of 1 l/3 percent of GDP. In accordance with the fiscal framework of the Government's Long-Term Program for 1994-97, the budget holds the underlying real growth in state expenditure (1 percent) in 1996 below the expected growth of mainland output (about 22 percent). Apart from some relatively minor adjustments to income and excise taxes, u the tax system was unchanged. While agreeing that the broad orientation of fiscal policy was appropriate, the staff representatives questioned whether the 1996 budget was sufficiently restrictive from both a short- and long-term perspective. The cumulative fiscal tightening during 1994-96 was significant, but equivalent to less than half of the fiscal stimulus (7 percent of GDP) applied during the 1989-93 downswing. A more restrictive stance for 1996-- entailing a withdrawal of stimulus of 1 percent of GDP, rather than the budgeted % percent-- would lessen the risk that output runs ahead of potential, giving rise to inflationary pressures. Moreover, further action at this stage of the cycle would provide greater leeway for possible future downturns, and facilitate progress in addressing the long-term fiscal challenges (see below). Given the high tax burden, further consolidation should focus on restraining spending. There was also scope to reduce further the distortive effect of the tax system on savings and investment u The threshold for the highest bracket was raised in relative terms and deductions for child and elder care reduced somewhat; excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol and gasoline were lowered to reduce the incentive for cross-border shopping; and the import regime for US and Japanese cars was brought into line with that of European cars by abolishing tariffs.

IJ In response, the authorities reiterated their commitment to using fiscal policy to maintain economic stability. While sharing the staff's assessment that economic slack had been absorbed, they pointed out that there were no overt signs of inflationary pressures. They noted the importance to inflation prospects of the upcoming wage round, and were encouraged that the main employees' organization was taking a moderate stance ahead of the negotiations --a position that reflected the achievements of the agreed approach to economic policy. There were no indications of potential labor market bottlenecks, except in construction where large-scale public projects (such as the new Oslo airport) were creating strong labor demand that was being partly met by workers from other Scandinavian countries. Should signs of overheating develop in the period ahead, the annual spring revision of the budget would provide opportunity to modify policies as needed. In any event, the 1997 budget would again be guided by the framework of the Long-Term Program which implies further tightening by holding spending growth below that of mainland output. The authorities explained that steps were being taken, through the activation of the hitherto dormant State Petroleum Fund (SPF), toward a framework for long-term fiscal management designed to preserve benefits of Norway's oil wealth for future generations (Box 2). In the 1996 state budget, it had been decided to allocate the entire surplus (projected at Nkr 12.6 billion, or 1 l/3 percent of GDP) to the SPF. Given the adverse consequences for inflation and competitiveness of injecting these resources into the domestic economy, all of the resources accumulated in the SPF in 1996 would be invested in foreign financial assets. While no policy decisions on the buildup of SPF resources have been taken beyond 1996, the authorities have estimated that saving future increases in petroleum revenues and undertaking additional medium-term fiscal consolidation of up to 4 percent of GDP would avoid placing a burden on future generations. If it continued to be fed by the resultant fiscal surpluses, the SPF would reach a level that would address the long-term fiscal policy challenges on a self-sustaining basis. 2/ While acknowledging that the SPF would bear some of the features of a funded pension scheme, the authorities preferred to avoid such a characterization.

The authorities did not think that preserving oil wealth for the future by reducing the rate of extraction was either feasible or economic--such limits would reduce the return on the heavy and relatively short-lived investment made to bring Norway's fields to production, and it was far from clear that oil left in the ground would return more than investments in financial assets. 2. Monetarv and exchanrre rate oolicv The staff representatives agreed that the monetary policy framework established by the 1994 guidelines had continued to serve well: inflation had been kept low and the krone had stayed within the desired range against the ECU, apparently unaffected by recent bouts of market turmoil elsewhere in Europe. Looking forward, the staff asked how the authorities would respond if pressures developed (in either direction) in the exchange market. The authorities explained that, under the guidelines, Norges Bank is not obligated to defend any particular parity but, in case of significant deviation from the desired range, the Bank would orient its policies towards bringing the exchange rate back to this range over time. In the event of downward pressure, Norges Bank would raise interest rates; in the event of upward pressure that could be associated with the cyclical upswing and buoyant petroleum revenues, the Bank was prepared to intervene to purchase foreign exchange, beyond the acquisition of foreign assets corresponding to the fiscal surpluses accruing to the SPF. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - The staff agreed that in the current cyclical position there would be scope to raise interest rates if the krone were subject to downward pressures. The case of upward pressure was more complex. Upward pressure that reflected an appreciation of the real equilibrium exchange rate could give rise to a conflict between the intermediate goal of exchange rate stability and the objective of low inflation. In this situation, efforts to keep the nominal exchange rate stable would ultimately be followed by higher inflation. The authorities observed that intervention would be essentially a stopgap measure; within the framework of the solidarity alternative--with its emphasis on maintaining competitiveness through exchange rate stability and wage moderation-- they viewed fiscal policy as the instrument through which the potential dilemma posed by a tendency for the equilibrium exchange rate to appreciate could, at least to a degree, be averted. Indeed, the lesson from,earlier periods was that an appropriate fiscal stance was--over the longer term-- key to ameliorating the "Dutch-disease" problems of crowding out of export-oriented and import-competing activities by a buoyant petroleum sector. Of course, in the event of a major shock (such as to oil prices), the desired range of the nominal exchange rate might need to be reconsidered. As for the current situation, Norges Bank intended to keep monetary conditions tight (within the constraints implied by the exchange rate objective) and would therefore not necessarily follow monetary easing elsewhere in Europe. Norges Bank's monetary policy independence is limited to operational decisions within policy guidelines articulated by the Ministry of Finance. The authorities indicated that no changes in these arrangements were planned. 3. Norway and the EU u The staff representatives inquired about the implications of Norway's decision (in the November 1994 referendum) not to join the EU. 2/ As far as short-term effects were concerned, the authorities explained that the prompt further tightening of fiscal policy (amounting to % percent of GDP) designed to boost confidence in the wake of the referendum had reassured markets. Through the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, Norway I-J A more detailed analysis of these issues is presented in the background paper. u In advance of the referendum, the authorities had argued that, while the EEA agreement secures Norway's participation in the EU's single market, the economic benefits of EU membership would outweigh the not insignificant budgetary costs. Norway's annual net contribution to the EU was estimated to amount to 3/4 percent of GDP. With a 50 percent tax/GDP ratio, EU membership needed to add 0.15 percentage points to annual GDP growth over a 10 year period to cover the budgetary contributions. By spurring business investment over the longer term, EU membership was expected to provide at least the additional growth needed. An additional benefit to consumers was an expected lo-20 percent decline in food prices resulting from the adoption of EU agricultural prices from the date of accession.

The EEA had been reaffirmed in early 1995 following the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the EU. 2J Nevertheless, the ability of the EFTA side to influence the development of single market legislation had been further curtailed. The participation of the acceding countries in the EU's customs union had led to some negative effects in specific--albeit small--sectors (such as the fisheries, where the accession of Sweden and Finland had raised barriers to market access for Norwegian fish exporters). On the whole, the adverse effects of the rejection of EU membership had been quite limited in the short term. However, concerns remained for the long-term effects on business investment, because investors, both foreign and domestic, might perceive Norway as outside the European mainstream. It was also clear that non-membership would make Norway's participation in the development of new monetary and exchange rate arrangements in Europe more problematic. In any case, however, the issue of EU membership was not likely to be raised again at the political level in Norway until after the conclusion of the EU's upcoming intergovernmental conference at the earliest. 4. Structural oolicies w Norway's participation in the EEA has entailed implementation of structural reforms in a range of areas, notably the removal of most restrictions on capital movements and strengthening of competition policy. The staff emphasized the importance of more wide-ranging reforms to enhance allocative efficiency, particularly with a view to the time when petroleum resources become less abundant. Labor market reform continues to be an issue, with open unemployment plus those engaged in labor market programs amounting to in excess of 7 percent of the labor force. Steps have been taken to improve the effectiveness of active labor market programs by targeting the young and the long-term unemployed, and to strengthen employment intermediation by allowing private job agencies to collaborate with the equivalent public sector institutions. The authorities explained that proposals were under consideration to tighten existing limits on the duration of unemployment benefits (currently, the benefit period can be extended indefinitely by switching between open unemployment and participation in active labor market programs). The fate of these proposals was yet to be decided. Legislation concerning job security, already judged by the OECD to be the most restrictive in Europe, has become even more so as a result of amendments in the final legislative stages that banned all fixed-term employment contracts lJ Agricultural goods are not covered by the EEA agreement, and trade in industrial goods from third countries is subject to strict rules of origin. ?/ The EFTA pillar of the EEA now comprises Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. 2/ Labor and financial market developments are discussed further in the background paper.

The authorities were planning to reduce the effects of the ban on fixed term contracts in certain specialized occupations (such as in sports and entertainment) where it was clearly unsuitable. The authorities envisage that the state will continue to play a significant role in Norway's financial system. Reflecting holdings in major commercial banks acquired at the time of the 1991 banking crisis, together with the state investment banks (which provide housing and student loans as well as development finance for agriculture and industry), state-owned banks currently account for about half of credit extension. The authorities recently successfully floated Fokus Bank, the smallest of the three banks acquired during the 1991 crisis. The government holds approximately 70 percent and 50 percent of the shares of the largest and second largest bank, respectively lJ; its policy is to maintain its holdings at or above 50 percent during the current parliament (i.e., until 1997) and subsequently at or above one third, a level considered sufficient to provide a controlling interest. The Norwegian representatives explained that the 1991 banking crisis had revealed deficiencies in the management of the large commercial banks that they attributed to the previous highly diversified structure of private ownership, and they also pointed to public concerns that full privatization could lead to foreign control of Norwegian banks. The financial performance of the banks had improved markedly with the economic upswing: in fact, negative loan loss provisions (as previous write- offs were restored to performing status) were currently an important component of net income that had enabled banks to compete aggressively on interest margins (which in turn indicated that the high level of state ownership was not an impediment to competition). In response to the crisis and its aftermath, the authorities have added significantly to the resources of the banking supervisory authority both for inspection of individual banks and for early detection of adverse trends in the economic environment. Under the Uruzuav round agreement, the authorities have converted agricultural quotas to tariffs and have already implemented the full reduction in tariff rates that was mandated to be phased in over five years. They acknowledged that, reflecting the extremely high initial level of protection, the current reduced rates were still high by international standards (300-400 percent for meat and dairy products, for example). Looking forward, the Government's policy is to reduce protection to EXJ levels, although specific plans to this end have yet to be articulated. 1/ In early December, the Government lowered its holdings in Christiania Bank and Kreditkassen (CBK) from 69 percent to 51 percent.

IV. Staff ADDraiSal The Norwegian economy has performed impressively over the past year, overcoming the period of uncertainty associated with the EU referendum. The upturn in the mainland economy has continued and become more broadly based. Employment growth has been particularly brisk, permitting a significant decline in unemployment despite rising participation. Inflation is low and the external position comfortable. Norway's stability-oriented macroeconomic policies have contributed importantly to this favorable performance. The tightening of fiscal policy undertaken after the EU referendum was appropriate in light both of the need to bolster confidence and of the strength of the upturn in the mainland economy. The policy of exchange rate stability against European currencies, together with continued government-encouraged social consensus on the advantages of wage moderation, has kept inflation low. The government is also commendably taking steps to focus policy formation on the tasks facing Norway in the next century. These achievements notwithstanding, the authorities face important policy challenges. Official forecasts indicate a rate of mainland economic expansion in 1996 that would bring the level of output above potential. Although there 'are few firm signs of rising inflation so far, there is a risk that the moderate policy tightening proposed for 1996 may prove insufficient to prevent overheating. The authorities should therefore be prepared to introduce additional fiscal tightening as early as in the revised 1996 budget if the pace of expansion remains above potential or other signs of gathering inflationary pressures--particularly wage growth-- should appear. Given the high tax burden, additional fiscal measures should maintain the focus of recent budgets on restraining expenditure, with particular attention to the high levels of subsidies and transfers. The current framework for monetary and exchange rate policy has worked well in an environment characterized by a lack of shocks specific to Norway. Within this framework, Norges Bank has appropriately kept monetary conditions tight by not following recent interest rate reductions elsewhere in Europe. However, there is potential for policy conflict in the period ahead. Specifically, if the equilibrium exchange rate were to appreciate in response to the upswing and buoyant petroleum revenues, keeping the krone stable against the ECU in the face of upward market pressure could conflict with the ultimate goal of low inflation. This could also signal a return to earlier "Dutch-disease" problems of declining market shares for mainland economic activities, as from a competitiveness perspective there appears little room for further real effective appreciation beyond that of the past two years. A tighter fiscal stance should to some extent alleviate upward Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - pressures, but intervention-- as the authorities recognize--would be no more than a stopgap measure. As regards the broader institutional framework for monetary policy, the credibility of Norway's commitment to low inflation would be strengthened by increasing the independence of Norges Bank. The prospective decline in the net cash flow to the budget from the petroleum sector early in the next century as pension obligations begin to rise requires that resources be set aside to&y to avoid burdening future generations. Norway's large net financial assets and petroleum resources leave it better situated than most industrial countries to prepare for this challenge. Timely action to set aside resources would ensure that Norway can maintain its advantageous position even when petroleum revenues begin to decline. The steps to establish a mechanism for this purpose through the activation of the State Petroleum Fund are therefore welcome. The decision that all the resources accumulated in the State Petroleum Fund in 1996 will be invested abroad is appropriate, and it would be helpful to institutionalize this practice for future years by removing the provision for SPF resources to finance part of state bank lending. There should be a firm commitment, in future budgets and the next Long-Term Program, to a fiscal policy that will ensure a sufficient accumulation of assets for the long term. In this regard, tax and benefit rules affecting pensions should not be inviolate; in particular, steps to address the mode of indexation of pensions and their preferential tax treatment, as well as to encourage a higher effective retirement age, could contribute importantly to narrowing the long-term imbalance. Beyond the issue of future pension obligations, the long-term challenge should also be viewed in terms of the shape of Norway's economy once the petroleum sector eventually begins to decline. Some features of Norway's economic life that petroleum revenues have helped to sustain--high agricultural and industrial subsidies, large transfers, and a high share of public sector employment and ownership --are unlikely to be compatible with the development of a competitive post-oil economy. Early action on these fronts will ease the eventual transition. An area of current concern is the labor market, despite a recent performance that is better than in most European countries. The unemployment problem has been partly alleviated in recent years by increased public sector employment, heavy resort to early retirement through disability pensions, and an expansion of labor market programs. Increasing the flexibility of the labor market would have beneficial effects on competitiveness and facilitate the growth of private sector employment. Particular emphasis should be placed on curtailing the effective duration of unemployment benefits and ensuring that costly labor market programs are scaled back commensurately with the upswing. The recent tightening of restrictions on temporary employment--which often provides an important entrance for newcomers to the labor market--is a step in the wrong direction, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - The recent disposals of some holdings in commercial banks are welcome steps in unwinding the state ownership that developed during the banking crisis. The state can most effectively ensure a sound and efficient supply of financing for domestic activities through stability-oriented macroeconomic policies and firm supervision that promotes sound risk management practices, rather than through continued state ownership. To this end, the government should withdraw from its dominant role in the Norwegian credit system by fully re-privatizing its share in the two largest commercial banks and by privatizing the lending activities of state banks that compete with those of private financial institutions. An additional step in improving the allocation of capital would be to minimize the distortions of saving and investment decisions caused by the tax system; the favorable treatment of housing investment warrants particular attention. The early implementation of Norway's Uruguay Round commitments regarding the import regime for agricultural products is welcome. Nevertheless, Norway still has one of the most heavily protected agricultural sectors in the world. Unilateral action to lower agricultural tariffs substantially further would bring immediate and substantial benefits to Norwegian consumers, and a more liberal agricultural trade policy would complement Norway's generous aid effort. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Norway take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Recently, Statistics Norway undertook the first major revision of the Norwegian national accounts in twenty years associated with their implementation of EU directives concerning the European System of Accounts (ESA), which is based on the 1993 SNA. The revision raised the level of 1990 GDP by 9.3 percent and by a similar magnitude for subsequent years. Approximately three fourths of the change is the result of the incorporation of new data, whereas one fourth results from new accounting practices. In the view of the Norwegian authorities, the revision has made the Norwegian national accounts more comparable to those of other industrial countries. In addition, the authorities have also initiated work to implement the methodology and presentation of the Balance of Pavments Manual.
