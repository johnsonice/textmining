Discussions for the 2001 Article IV consultation were held in Thimpu during January 23-3 1,200 1. The mission met with Finance Secretary Dasho Wangdi Norbu; Royal Monetary Authority Managing Director Sonam Wangchuk, Trade, Industry and Power Minister Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk, Agriculture Minister Lyonpo Kinzang Dorji; other senior officials; and members of the business and donor communities. The staffteam comprised Messrs. Gordon (Head), Lee, and Cheunsomchit (all APD). The mission coordinated closely with AsDB staff (Ms. Ho). Mr. Keshava (Assistant, OED) attended the meetings. . Bhutan is on a 24-month consultation cycle. In concluding the 1999 consultation discussions on June 7, 1999 (SUR/99/58), Executive Directors commended the authorities’ prudent policies, which had achieved strong growth while preserving the country’s cultural heritage and delicate environment. They viewed the central challenge facing Bhutan as improving living standards through more rapid and equitable growth, while reducing vulnerabilities arising from heavy reliance on electricity production and foreign aid. ln these endeavors, Directors emphasized that the key challenges facing the authorities were to expand the private sector and to promote investment in infrastructure and human capital. l In the period since the last consultation, GDP growth has averaged 6 percent per annum and inflation has been moderate. Fiscal policy has remained prudent, with domestic revenues more than covering current expenditures, and maximum use made of concessional financing. Buoyant electricity exports and donor inflows have led to large balance of payments surpluses and record levels of foreign reserves. However, the economy remains dependent on the power sector, which creates few jobs for Bhutan’s increasingly educated labor force, and unemployment is becoming a concern. . The challenge facing Bhutan continues to be to foster private sector development and create employment. While medium-term prospects are favorablethe potential for growth in electricity exports is enormous and donors are strongly committed development partners-creating employment will require that growth is more broadly-based. Despite recent structural reforms, there has been limited progress in developing new private sector activities to date. 0 The authorities have made concerted efforts to upgrade Bhutan’s statistical database over the past two years. However, data limitations remain, and hamper effective assessment of economic developments and policies, particularly from outside the country. 0 The authorities have not yet indicated whether they would be willing to publish the staff report. Bhutan continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under the provisions of Article XIV, Section 2. 0 The principal authors of this report are Mr. James Gordon and Mr. Joong Shik Lee.

INTRODUCTIONANDRECENTDEVELOPMENTS 1. Major political reforms have recently taken place in Bhutan. In 1998, the Ring of Bhutan empowered the elected National Assembly to choose a Cabinet of Ministers vested with full executive powers. The National Assembly was also granted the right to a vote of confidence in the ruling monarch. In 1999, a major restructuring of the Royal Government was embarked upon with the aim of improving efficiency, transparency, and accountability. 2. The authorities have adopted a cautious approach to economic development. A careful balance has been struck between modernizing Bhutan and preserving the pristine environment and traditional culture. Although exploitation of the natural resource and tourist potential has been tightly controlled, the economy has enjoyed rapid GDP growth over the past two decades, with dramatic improvements made in social indicators (Text Table).

The Bhutanese economy is tightly integrated with its much larger Indian neighbor. More than 80 percent of Bhutan’s trade flows are with India, which is Bhutan’s largest foreign donor and source of expatriate labor. There are no restrictions on trade and payments between the two countries. The Ngultrum is pegged at parity to the Indian rupee, which circulates freely within Bhutan. These links preclude independent monetary policy, and interest rates in Bhutan tend to closely track those in India.

Over the past two years, growth has been robust and inflation has been moderate. Although southern Bhutan was affected by floods in August 2000, GDP is expected to grow by 6 percent in 2000/01 (year ending June), much the same rate as in 1999/2000 (Figure 1 and Table 1). The economy is increasingly dominated by the hydropower sector (Text Chart) and the building of new power projects has led to double-digit growth in the construction and transport sectors.’ The inflation rate in Bhutan-which has closely tracked that ’ The combined contribution of the electricity, construction and transport sectors to GDP is one third, about the same size as that of agriculture. The remaining third is dominated by manufacturing, trade and financial services, and government.

In October 2000, pump prices for petrol and diesel were increased by 9 percent and 60 percent, respectively, while kerosene prices were more than doubled. 5. Fiscal policy has been eased, but has remained prudent. The authorities have historically avoided borrowing to finance recurrent expenditures and have maintained the fiscal current balance in surplus. The latter reached 4% percent of GDP in 1999/2000 due to a jump in electricity revenues: and an abnormally large excise duty refund from the Indian government (Table 2). Nonetheless, the overall deficit (including foreign grants) doubled to 4 percent of GDP in 1999/2000, primarily reflecting a pick-up in capital spending once the 8th Five-Year Plan (1997/98-2001/02) gained momentum. A similar deficit level was budgeted for 2000/01, but staff estimate that the outturn will be slightly higher at about 4X-5 percent of GDP as a result of expenditure to rebuild flood-damaged infrastructure. 6. Generous external financing has kept the balance of payments in surplus. Despite the rise in electricity exports, the current account deficit widened during 1999/2000 (Table 3). This resulted from the construction of new power projects, which led to a surge in capital equipment imports and rising factor service payments. The current account deficit is projected to remain high for the same reasons in 2000/01. However, increased foreign aid, particularly from India associated with the Tala power project, has provided more than commensurate financing and has kept the balance of payments in substantial surplus. Foreign reserves (three quarters of which are in convertible currencies) increased to $309 million at end-September 2000, representing over a year and a half of imports, and about 180 percent of total external debt. The debt service ratio is estimated at 5% percent in 1999/2000. 7. Large balance of payments surpluses have led to rapid money Bhutan. Composition of Commercial Bank Assets, June l!W- June 2000 growth, but credit expansion has been sluggish. Reserve money increased by 80 50 percent in the two years ending June 2000, almost exactly equal to the 2 860 buildup in the Royal Monetary Authority’s @MA) net foreign assets over the same z i!40 period. Broad money growth averaged 2 1 t percent per annum during 1998/99 and 20 1999/2000, but credit to the private sector grew by only 5 percent per annum (Table 4). 0 95.6 96.6 97.6 98.6 99.6 00.6 2 The electricity export tariff paid by India was increased in July 1999 from Nu 1.0 to Nu 1.5 per unit. This raised Bhutan’s export earnings by 3% percent of GDP in 1999/2000, of which about two thirds accrued to the government’s budget in the form of company tax and dividends.

Exclusive of consumer loans, credit to the private sector credit fell by 10 percent in the two years ending June 2000. Slow credit growth apparently reflects a cautious lending culture in the two commercial banks combined with a shortage of investment opportunities. 8. Despite recent efforts by the authorities, data limitations continue to hamper effective assessment of economic developments and policies in Bhutan. Over the past few years, the authorities have attempted to strengthen the statistical infrastructure through reorganizing the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) and undertaking a number of important surveys (Box 1). Nonetheless, some core data remain available only with long lags (Annex I). The information available between consultations is particularly limited and Bhutan’s relative inaccessibility to outsiders implies few external sources that can be used to keep abreast of economic developments. Box 1. Bhutan: Efforts to Improve the Statistical Database Shortcomings in Bhutan’s statistical database continue to hamper effective assessment of economic developments and policies. For example, the consumer price index is based on the results of a survey conducted in 1979 and data are available only on a semi-annual basis with a considerable lag. In addressing these weaknesses in Bhutan’s statistical database, the authorities have made a number of efforts to upgrade the quality and timeliness of the data over the last few years, ranging from reorganizing statistical agencies to conducting important statistical surveys. l The Planning Commission has been actively involved in setting statistical priorities, overseeing data collections, and improving coordination among key statistical agencies. The CSO has been completely reorganized with the aim of utilizing existing staff in a more efficient way. l The authorities conducted a Labor Force Survey in 1999, which will improve the availability of data on wages and employment. The Survey will be conducted by the National Employment Board each year for the next 5 years, and every 2 to 3 years thereafter. This process will serve to establish a time series of employment statistics. l The CSO has completed the Health Survey and the Industrial Census, and plans to update the results regularly in the future. l A preliminary Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) was completed in 2000 supported by technical assistance from the AsDB. An enlarged and improved HIES is being conducted in 2001. The final results will serve as a basis for revising the CPI, and improving compilation of the National Income Accounts. The HIES will also reveal information on poverty in Bhutan. Over the next few years, the CSO will create regional offices in all 20 districts. This will require almost doubling the CSO’s staff. One quarter of the required personnel have already been recruited, and are currently being trained. The new regional offices will permit more timely compilation of data, as well as the collection of a wider and more comprehensive data set. In addition, the AsDB will continue the second phase of its technical assistance ($0.8 million). The focus will be on the institutional development of the CSO in the areas of data collection, processing, and analysis and dissemination.

Discussions centered on Bhutan’s medium-term prospects and the policies needed to promote more balanced growth. In recent years, the authorities have taken steps to reduce the role of the state in the economy and to create a modem commercial environment in which the private sector can flourish (see Section C below). However, these efforts have had little success yet in either promoting the private sector or diversifying the economy. Lending to the private sector and nonelectricity exports remained depressed, while GDP growth was still heavily dependent on sectors that created little domestic employment. Thus, although Bhutan had enormous potential in terms of hydroelectric production and exports, creating jobs for the increasingly educated labor force posed a difficult challenge. 10. A particular focus of the discussions was the factors behind the lack of growth in private sector activity. The lack of private investment was partly attributable to the high cost structure arising from Bhutan’s mountainous and inaccessible terrain, as well as from the small domestic market. However, the authorities also stressed the role played by the absence of an entrepreneurial culture in Bhutan on which to base private sector development. These obstacles were daunting, but the authorities were committed to a reform program that would provide an enabling environment for private sector activity that hopefully would prevent unemployment from becoming a problem. A. Medium-Term Outlook and Vulnerabilities 11. By most standards, Bhutan’s medium-term outlook is bright and external vulnerabilities appear modest. Generating capacity is set to triple from 2006 with the commissioning of the Tala project, but would still only reach about 10 percent of its potential (Box 2). Although the electricity bonanza closely ties Bhutan’s fortunes to political and economic events in India, electricity exports should provide a steady lmalErkaidyE4lort~ source of income-the risks of (hkxl993=larJ contractions in supply as a result of u” technical or climatic factors appear -lkilfpTuit ---CA ao. to be low, while the tariff set bilaterally with India has historically 250. more than kept pace with inflation all.

The total capacity is estimated to be about 30,000 MW, of which over 16,000 MW is technically viable. The development of the power sector began in the late 1980s with the commissioning of the Chukha hydropower project (336 MW). The hydropower generation capacity in Bhutan is expected to increase significantly over the next few years, as new power projects are scheduled for completion. The Kurichu project will add 60 MW by the end of 2001, and the Basochu project will add another 60 MW in 2002. Bhutan’s generating capacity will increase threefold in 2006 with the commissioning of the Tala project (1,020 MW), but only to about one tenth of the country’s technically viable potential.

At present, Bhutan supplies less than ?4 percent of its neighbor’s demand. Internal demand in Bhutan will also rise substantially with progress made on the Rural Electrification Program (supported by a $10 million AsDB program). l The power plants are operated as run-of-the-river schemes and the risks of sharp contractions in electricity supply as a result of technical or climatic factors are not considered to be large. The projects are also considered to be environmentally benign. Nevertheless, the power sector in Bhutan faces challenges in the future. First, development of future projects is dependent on accessing adequate financing. A major source of funding is likely to be India and the fiscal situation there may prove to be a constraint. Second, and more importantly, the Bhutanese authorities must find a way to promote domestic employment through the income earned from the power sector. The power projects themselves tend to use expatriate labor and to generate little domestic employment.

Tensions with these groups have escalated somewhat in recent months. 12. The major domestic source of vulnerability over the medium term is that growth does not generate employment. In order to illustrate this issue, the staff discussed two scenarios with the authorities. The baseline would be growth of 5-6 percent (propelled by new power projects and other infrastructure investments), with foreign reserves continuing to increase (Table 5). While broadly favorable, this scenario would be associated with little domestic job creation. Under an alternative scenario, the efforts to create an enabling environment for the private sector activity would bear fruit, leading to much higher growth of GDP and employment. This scenario would be characterized by higher imports and reduced capital inflows (reflecting the greater domestic capacity to finance investment), thereby avoiding excessive accumulation of foreign reserves. These scenarios illustrated the importance of proceeding apace with structural reforms and also that, in the absence of private sector growth, large balance of payments surpluses were likely to persist. B. Macroeconomic Policies Fiscal Policy 13. The authorities emphasized that Bhutan’s fiscal policy continued to be guided by conservative principles, namely that domestic revenues at least cover current expenditures, and that capital expenditure be donor-financed as far as possible. Pressures to increase recurrent expenditures in recent years have arisen from new offices formed as part of the ongoing government restructuring; the continued expansion of health and education services (Box 3); and the need to increase the real value of civil service wages and emoluments, which had become eroded (Box 4). The authorities explained that adequate remuneration was key to maintaining a high-quality and efficient civil service. In keeping with the principle of maintaining current balance, these extra expenditures had been financed by additional domestic revenues, with part of the revenue gained from increases in the electricity export tariff explicitly earmarked to cover the cost of civil service wage awards. 14. Greater recourse has been made to domestic financing of capital spending. The authorities explained that capital expenditure had accelerated in 1999/2000 and 2000/01 once the 8th Plan got underway. However, donor assistance had lagged, leading to a larger overall deficit and greater recourse to domestic financing, in the form of a drawdown of government deposits with the banking system. Once this source of finance was exhausted, the option of issuing long-term government securities to finance capital expenditure would need to be considered. The staff observed that although there was a large pool of liquidity in the banking system available to purchase such paper, increased use of domestic financing would imply higher interest costs and eventually put pressure on the budget. While there was a continuing need for public investment, it would be preferable to finance this through revenue mobilization rather than domestic borrowing.

Bhutan: Five-Year Development Plans Beginning in the early 196Os, successive five-year plans have provided the basic framework for development planning in Bhutan. The authorities recently conducted a mid-term review of the 8th Plan (1997/98-2001/02) and established guidelines for preparation of the 9th Plan (2002/03-2007/08). A. Mid-Term Review of the 8th Five-Year Plan The 8th Plan aimed for sustainable growth and improved living standards while ensuring the preservation of Bhutan’s environment and cultural heritage. The review found that Plan objectives had been met in the following areas: Macroeconomic performance had been satisfactory with the hydropower projects contributing significantly to economic growth. Fiscal performance had been solid with domestic revenue increased by improved tax collection and a higher power tariff. Most social development goals had been achieved. There had been a substantial increase in the number of educational facilities and 90 percent of the population now had access to basic health services. The Department of Urban Development and Housing had been created to provide urban infrastructure services and to manage the municipal affairs of growing townships in the country. By the end of 1999,45 km of new road construction had been completed, with funding secured to construct an additional 122 km of new roads. Considerable progress had been made in expanding the telecommunication network, which now connects all 20 district headquarters. National television and Internet services were launched in 1999. Since 1997, government ownership in a number of public enterprises had been substantially reduced through divestiture. The Agriculture Ministry had established a Marketing Section to induce private sector participation. In education, one private secondary school and seven private primary schools had been established, and applications for the establishment of additional private schools were being reviewed. All infrastructure developments had been undertaken within the policy of conserving the rich natural resources. More than 72 percent of land area is currently under forest coverage. As part of the government-restructuring program, two new divisions (the National Employment Board and the Division of Information Technology) and one new department (Legal Affairs) had been created. B. Guidelines for the 9th Five-Year Plan l%e Planning Commission released guidelines for the preparation of the 9th Plan in January 2001, focusing on Jalanced development, decentralization, and promotion of private sector development. The following objectives have )een emphasized throughout the guideline document: ) Greater revenue mobilization through improvement in tax collection and enhancement of the tax base; , Focus on a rural access program to improve the quality of life and income of rural people; . Consolidation and improvement of existing infrastructure and services; . Initiation of regional based planning, and greater autonomy of local governments in the financing of their development programs; and . Investment in areas where employment generation will be maximized. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- lo- Box 4. Bhutan: Civil Service Wages and Salaries Up until the mid-1990s, civil service wages in the Royal Government of Bhutan had been virtually frozen since 1988, the year of the last general increase. The freeze was part of the Government effort to contain the growth of recurrent expenditure and ensure that the budget’s current balance continued to record surpluses. However, real wages became considerably eroded over time. In the 8th Five-Year Plan, the government announced the intention to gradually restore civil service wages to their 1988 level in real terms. Since 1994, a series of wage and salary adjustments have been introduced subject to the constraint that the fiscal current balance did not go into deficit. l In 1994, the government implemented an interim across the board payment of Nu 500 per month to all civil servants. l In 1996, civil salaries were increased substantially by 25 percent. l In 1997, the government increased civil salaries by 20 percent in conjunction with an increase in revenue from the doubling of the electricity export tariff from Nu 0.5 to Nu 1 .O per unit. l In 1999, the authorities applied part of the revenue from the additional increase in the electricity export tariff, from Nu 1 .O to Nu 1.5 per unit, to the financing of a further 20 percent raise in civil service salaries. Notwithstanding these sizable adjustments to civil service wages, staff estimate that average real wages in 1999/2000 were still 20 percent below the level of the late 198Os, with the real wages of those in higher grades even more compressed. While the real wages of the lowest grade in 1999/2000 were 88 percent of the 1988/89 level, the real wages of the highest grade were only 72 percent, raising a concern about retaining talented managerial and professional personnel in the civil service.

In view of the need to maintain the budget’s current surplus, these are likely to be linked to future growth in revenue from the power sector. However, civil service wages influence remuneration elsewhere in the economy and there are limits to which they can be raised in the future without affecting competitiveness.

Looking forward, the’staff stressed the need to ensure that the medium-term fiscal strategy was sustainable. This was particularly important given the recent upturn in the deficit. The authorities were not in a position to discuss the 2001/02 budget, but they were starting to think about the broad fiscal parameters for the upcoming 9th Five-Year Plan (2002/03-2007/08). In framing the 9th Plan, the staff encouraged continuation of the practice of running surpluses on the current fiscal balance. At the same time, it would also be important to ensure that the overall fiscal deficit envisaged in the plan implied a path for government debt that was clearly sustainable. 16. Revenue priorities under the 9th Plan were likely to include enhancing the tax base and improving tax administration and collection. In this context, personal income taxation legislation had been drafted, but there were doubts as to whether it would be passed by the National Assembly in the July 2001 session. The staff hoped that the delay in introducing the personal income tax would be minimal. The authorities described current experiments to introduce user fees in health and education, arguing that for both equity and budgetary reasons, some costs should be recovered from those who could afford to pay for more sophisticated services. They were also optimistic that their efforts to strengthen tax administration would boost revenue, as well as help prepare for an eventual broad-based general sales tax.4 Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Policy 17. The exchange rate peg has served Bhutan well. Even though fixing the Ngultrum to the Indian rupee in 1974 was intended as an interim measure, the authorities viewed the arrangement as continuing to be beneficial. Staff calculations of the CPI-based real effective exchange rate suggested that competitiveness had been maintained under the peg (Figure 2). However, such a measure was likely to be a particularly imperfect measure of competitiveness in the case of Bhutan where food items have a 75 percent weight in the CPI. Nonetheless, the exchange rate arrangement had clear advantages in terms of maintaining confidence and tying Bhutan to the relatively stable monetary conditions that had prevailed in India. The peg also had provided substantial benefits in terms of predictability and convenience, particularly as trade and other links with India were so strong. The staff, therefore, agreed that the existing exchange arrangement remained appropriate.5 18. However, the peg, combined with large balance of payments surpluses and weak loan demand, has been associated with substantial excess liquidity. The commercial 4 A Sales Tax, Customs and Excise Tax Act was passed in 2000 so as to cod@ the various existing indirect tax regulations. 5 Given the substantial accumulation of foreign reserves, a more flexible exchange rate regime would likely imply a more appreciated Ngultrum, which would reduce Bhutan’s competitiveness and exacerbate the twin problems of overdependence on the power sector and jobless growth.

Some support for this argument is provided by the high level of corporate fixed deposits, which suggest that cash-rich companies are also unwilling to invest in new projects. At the same time, however, bank lending in Bhutan is collateral- based and conservative, reflecting the lack of credit-appraisal skills and an already high level of nonperforming loans. The small number of banks also implies a lack of competition and interest rates tend to be downwardly rigid even above the floor provided by rates in India. Staff concluded that while recent steps to strengthen the legal framework for loan recovery should help make lending practices more flexible, other efforts would also be necessary. In this context, the authorities stressed the importance of building up human resources in the banking sector, with the development of credit appraisal skills a particular priority. 19. Although excess liquidity was likely to persist, it did not appear to be an immediate macroeconomic threat. Excess liquidity has, however, served to complicate domestic monetary management and the authorities requested technical assistance from the Fund in this area. The RMA was particularly concerned about the extent to which RMA bills should be used to absorb liquidity, which, given existing capital controls, would otherwise be held as unremunerated excess reserves. Since these reserves did not appear to threaten inflation or the balance of payments, the RMA was not convinced by the need to absorb them at a cost to itself. This cost was inflated by the small number of buyers of RMA bills which tended to keep the auction rate artificially high. In any case, the authorities expected excess liquidity to decline in the near term as a result of Druk Air buying a new aircrafL6 Liquidity would also be absorbed through the budget’s recourse to domestic financing, but staff argued that a durable solution to the excess liquidity problem would require a sustained pick-up in private investment. 20. Steps have been taken to strengthen prudential regulations and bank supervision. In 1999, new prudential regulations were introduced, requiring banks to maintain a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio of 8 percent. As of end-1999, one commercial bank fell slightly below this level, while the other three financial institutions were much better capitalized. The new regulations also adopted a more stringent definition of non- performing assets (NPAs). Under the new definition, the two commercial banks had NPAs of about 10 percent of their loans at end-1999 (which as noted are a minor component of bank assets). The AsDB is currently helping the authorities to strengthen bank supervision and is also conducting a general review of the financial sector (in conjunction with the World Bank). C. Private Sector Development 21. The authorities outlined their strategy to stimulate the development of the private sector. In recent years, efforts to liberalize the economy and create an enabling 6 Druk Air plans to purchase two new aircraft in 2001/02 at a cost of $25 million a piece. One will be financed domestically (with the lender buying foreign exchange from the RMA); the other will be financed by external commercial borrowing. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - environment for the private sector have included corporatizing government departments (telecommunications); abolishing state monopolies (petroleum distribution); privatizing public enterprises (trade, cement, banks); and roviding the legislative building blocks necessary for a modern commercial economy. Y However, as noted above, thus far these measures had not been fully successful in stimulating private sector activity, and the authorities had recently formed a high-level Private Sector Development Committee to investigate this problem. 22. The authorities are attempting to improve the competitiveness of industry in a number of ways. They are undertaking major investments in infrastructure in order to reduce transport and other business costs. In addition, new industrial estates are planned in the south-close to the Indian market-so as to encourage investments that could take advantage of Bhutan’s inexpensive power.’ The authorities are also attempting to increase labor productivity through substantial investments in education and human capital. In this context, the staff expressed concern that civil service wage hikes financed by higher electricity earnings might spill over into private sector wage awards that were not justified by productivity gains. The authorities were aware of this possibility, but did not think that such (Dutch Disease) effects had been significant to date. 23. The authorities are also endeavoring to develop agricultural production and the tourism industry. Agriculture employs 85 percent of the population, so its development is key to raising living standards and reducing poverty. The private sector is expected to be the principal driver of agricultural growth, but Bhutan’s inaccessible and mountainous terrain constrains farmers in getting produce to market. Road and infrastructure investments that improve rural access are therefore a top priority. By reducing migration, greater agricultural prosperity will also benefit urban areas since these have begun to suffer congestion. Another initiative is to allow farmers to exchange remote and scattered plots of land under cultivation for forested areas closer to their homes. This will enable farmers to reap economies of scale without reducing the amount of land under forest cover. Growth that does not damage the environment is also a priority in the tourism sector, where again the private sector is expected to play the leading role. 7 The Royal Government has reduced its holdings in the State Trading Company (from 100 to 5 1 percent); Penden Cement Authority (from 60 to 47 percent); and Bhutan National Bank (from 67 to 27 percent, with the shares sold to Citibank and the AsDB). A one fifth stake in the (61 percent) state-owned Royal Insurance Corporation is on offer for sale. Recent legislation passed has included the Negotiable Instruments Act; the Bankruptcy Act; and the Movable and Immovable Property Act. ’ These efforts have been given added impetus by the concern that India’s removal of quantitative restrictions (QRs) in April 2001 will threaten previously captive markets for some of Bhutan’s exports. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- 24. A foreign direct investment law is being drafted. In order to create a coherent and transparent framework for foreign investment, the authorities are currently preparing an FDI law with the assistance of the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FLU). The authorities considered foreign investment to have the potential to create employment, transfer technology, and inject a healthy dose of competition into the domestic market. Joint ventures might be particularly helpful in promoting the development of local skills and the entrepreneurial base. 25. Important steps have been taken with regard to privatization and corporatization. Staff argued that additional efforts should be made on both fronts. One option worth considering was the government further divesting its shares in financial institutions, since greater private participation (including by foreign banks) might help to promote new lending. The authorities acknowledged this possibility, but noted that a constraint on further privatization in Bhutan was the small number of potential buyers. D. Trade, Exchange Regime, and Reserve Management 26. The scope for further trade liberalization was limited by Bhutan’s ties with India. The authorities explained that concerns over re-exports to India constrain Bhutan’s ability to reduce tariffs and abolish import licensing. Moreover, tariffs in Bhutan already tend to be lower on average than in India. The staff argued that the authorities should nonetheless reassess the scope for further trade liberalization, particularly given that Bhutan has applied to join the WTO. Such a reassessment is also timely in light of India’s recent removal of remaining QRs. 27. The exchange system has remained unchanged over the past two years. New regulations introduced in 1997 brought Bhutan close to current account convertibility, although restrictions under Article XIV continue to be maintained in the form of (i) prescribed limits on travel allowances; (ii) limits on the availability of foreign exchange for imports of services; and (iii) limits on foreign exchange for private transfers. 28. The staff suggested that the comfortable level of foreign reserves afforded the authorities an opportunity to remove the remaining restrictions under Article XIV. However, the authorities did not view this as a priority, especially since the private sector considered the current exchange system to be administered liberally. Staff argued that, at a minimum, exporters should be allowed retention of 10 percent of their hard currency export earnings as is provided for in the 1997 Foreign Exchange Regulations. With regard to reserve management, the staff were reassured to learn that foreign exchange reserves were held offshore with highly-rated financial institutions. E. Statistical Issues 29. The authorities were pleased that their efforts to upgrade Bhutan’s statistical system were being recognized. They emphasized that the Planning Commission had become involved in the setting of statistical priorities, and this had improved coordination among statistical agencies. The CSO had also been reorganized to improve its effectiveness, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- and a significant increase in its personnel was being planned so as to permit compilation of wider and more comprehensive data. The authorities were conducting a number of important surveys, one of which-the Household Income and Expenditure Survey-would yield information on poverty in Bhutan. 30. The staff stressed that much still needed to be done to bring Bhutan’s statistical data up to international standards. The staff emphasized in particular the need to increase the frequency of data; one priority should be to produce fiscal data on a monthly, or at least quarterly, basis so as to permit better monitoring of the budget during the year. The authorities noted that the current efforts to computerize government offices would do much to improve the fiscal data. III. STAFF APPRAISAL 31. Bhutan’s medium-term prospects appear very favorable. The authorities have combined prudent macroeconomic policies with careful development of Bhutan’s natural resources, and have achieved major improvements in social indicators. The donors are strongly committed to assisting with Bhutan’s future development and there is vast potential for growth in electricity production and exports. Given the prospect of large additional infrastructure and hydropower investments, as well as of continued prudent policy-making, satisfactory rates of GDP growth should be maintained over the medium term. 32. However, the challenge remains to establish an environment that will support a take-off of private sector activity and more rapid generation of employment. Efforts to deregulate the economy and to foster the private sector have shown limited results to date. The private sector remains underdeveloped and the economy continues to be dependent on sectors that create little domestic employment. The difficult task facing the authorities is to devise new ways to bolster the development strategy that will broaden the economy’s productive base and generate much-needed employment growth. 33. The fiscal stance should not be allowed to ease further. The increase in the overall fiscal deficit over the past two years is a result of large capital projects rather than dissipative spending on current consumption. Nonetheless, the upcoming 9th Five-Year Plan represents an opportunity for the authorities to place the overall fiscal deficit on a clearly downward path so as to demonstrate a long-term commitment to fiscal sustainability. At the same time, the policy of maintaining surpluses on the fiscal current balance has done much to create confidence in the conduct of fiscal policy, and should be retained. Additional revenue mobilization will therefore be necessary to finance further increases in recurrent health and education spending. The staff also look forward to the introduction of the personal income tax as a means of increasing revenue buoyancy over the longer term. 34. Civil service wage hikes have been facilitated by Bhutan’s electricity wealth, but care will be needed to avoid adverse spillovers to the rest of the economy. Adequate remuneration is essential to maintain the small and efficient civil service in which Bhutan justifiably takes pride. However, civil service wages influence pay awards elsewhere in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- economy and there are limits to which they can be raised in the future without affecting competitiveness. 35. Exchange rate and financial sector policies remain appropriate. Given that economic links with India remain strong, the staff endorses continuation of the current exchange rate regime. While the excess liquidity in the financial system is not of immediate concern, the situation needs to be carefully monitored and the authorities should stand ready to absorb excess liquidity if it begins to threaten macroeconomic stability. At the same time, however, it remains important for the authorities to take further steps to improve the climate for private investment, as this would facilitate a more effective means of addressing the liquidity overhang. Moreover, bank lending practices also appear very conservative, and measures are needed to develop credit appraisal skills in the financial sector, as well as to stimulate greater competition between lenders. 36. More needs to be done to address the structural obstacles to private investment. The authorities’ investments in infrastructure, including the planned new industrial estates, should help to lower transport and other business costs. Investment in education and human capital should help to raise labor productivity. Foreign investment also has a role to play and promises benefits in terms of employment, technology transfer, and competition. Every effort should, therefore, be made to expedite the new foreign investment code. The staff also welcome the recent formation of the Private Sector Development Committee. 37. Growth in commercial agriculture and tourism is key to providing jobs in Bhutan. The authorities are attempting to improve rural access so as to reduce the marketing difficulties faced by farmers. If successful, these efforts will help to reverse migration from the rural areas and ease congestion problems in urban areas. With regard to tourism, the challenge, as the authorities well recognize, is to find ways of increasing the number of foreign visitors without putting Bhutan’s environment or culture at risk. 38. The comfortable reserve position permits further liberalization of the trade and exchange systems. While concerns over re-exports to India constrain Bhutan’s ability to engage in unilateral trade reform, the authorities should assess the scope for further liberalization in light of India’s recent removal of QRs, as well as Bhutan’s intention to join the WTO. Bhutan should also move toward eliminating the remaining restrictions maintained under Article XIV, with a view to accepting the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 at an early date. 39. Efforts to strengthen the statistical database should continue. The staff have been encouraged by recent efforts to upgrade the database, including through the reorganization of the CSO, and the undertaking of important statistical surveys. Nonetheless, data limitations remain and continue to hamper effective assessment of economic developments and policies. Resources expended to further improve Bhutan’s statistics efforts promise substantial payoffs to the authorities in terms of more-informed policy making, and early warning about potential problems. They will also be of benefit to donors and prospective foreign investors. 40. It is proposed that Bhutan remain on a 24-month consultation cycle.

The Fund takes this decision in concluding the 2001 Article XIV consultation with Bhutan. 2. Bhutan continues to maintain restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, as described in SlWO1/118, consisting of(i) prescribed limits on travel allowances; (ii) limits on the availability of foreign exchange for imports of services; and (iii) limits on foreign exchange for private transfers. The Fund encourages Bhutan to administer these restrictions in a liberal manner and to eliminate them as soon as circumstances permit.

The national income accounts, price and fiscal statistics suffer from significant limitations. There are also inconsistencies between the monetary, fiscal and the balance of payments statistics. Moreover, the data are subject to frequent, and at times substantial, revisions. The key factors contributing to the data deficiency are the shortage of qualified personnel and limitations in computing facilities. The Bhutanese authorities recognize these shortcomings and are working to remedy them in conjunction with the donors. 1. Real sector Estimates of GDP at factor cost and final use at current and constant prices are available only with significant lags and estimation procedures are sometimes ad hoc. Some deflators, most notably for government services, are inappropriate, thereby causing bias in deriving measures of output based on constant prices. Gross domestic saving is defined as gross investment minus net capital inflow, but the latter concept does not appear to correspond to either the balance on the trade account or on the current account. The consumer price index (CPI) is based on an outdated survey (1979) of consumer expenditures. Apart from the limited coverage of household expenditure (housing costs and many other key expenditures are excluded), the CPI is only compiled on a semi-annual basis. Technical assistance in the area of national accounts and prices, including a preliminary Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), was recently provided by the Asian Development Bank. The HIES is expected to provide a basis both for revising the CPI and for measuring poverty. Reliable data on employment and wages are not available, but a recent labor force survey-conducted with IL0 assistance-should improve the availability of labor statistics. 2. Monetary statistics The Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) of Bhutan reports monetary data to STA on a regular monthly basis, but usually with a lag of 6-7 months. The balance sheets of the RMA and the two commercial banks (the Bank of Bhutan and the Bhutan National Bank) are consolidated into a monetary survey. The statistics are based on end-month balance sheets prepared by these institutions and are generally consistent with the Fund’s guidelines for the classification of monetary statistics. There is, nevertheless, room for improvement in a number of areas. Specifically: (i) monetary data prior to 1996 need to be computerized; (ii) more thorough data checks should eliminate mistakes in the computation of broad money that are sometimes reflected in the RMA Bulletin; and (iii) RMA bills need to be recorded consistently at face value in the balance sheets of banks and in the consolidated monetary survey. 3. Public finance Despite recent improvements in the quality of government finance statistics, the fiscal data are subject to frequent and substantial revisions, particularly in the expenditure area. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - ANNEX1 Revenue data would benefit from a closer coordination between the various departments in the Ministry of Finance. There are also major inconsistencies between the fiscal and monetary data with regard to bank financing-the problem seems to be related to the definition of government between the two sets of accounts. 4. External sector Bhutan’s balance of payments data also require improvement. The balance of payments statistics cover a limited range of transactions and many of the key data are estimated. The problem is partly associated with the country’s unique exchange and trade system with India, as well as the large porous border between the two countries which give rise to substantial unrecorded trade in goods and services. No attempt is made to estimate the size of unrecorded trade between India and Bhutan and travel receipts and payments vis-A-vis India are based on assumption rather than on entry and exit surveys of tourists. There are also a number of other limitations. Most importantly, trade data are compiled on a calendar year basis while other external transactions are compiled on a fiscal year basis. Consequently, errors and omissions in the balance of payments presentations are large and fluctuate widely. Bhutan does not report balance of payments data for publication in IFS.

CBD/MAE Technical assistance was provided in setting up the Royal Monetary Authority @MA) of Bhutan in 1983 and technical experts from the CBD worked in the capacity of General Advisors to the RMA during the 1980s. The last General Advisor completed his term in January 1992. A mission visited Bhutan in May 1989 to review the financial system, and another mission visited in February 1991 to consult with the authorities on new financial sector legislation, including the development of supervisory capabilities. A technical expert was assigned in July 1991 as Advisor for Bank Supervision. An MAE mission visited Thimphu in June-July 1992 to advise the RMA on the issuance of government securities. A technical expert was assigned from July 1993 to February 1996 to implement the mission’s recommendations. b. Fiscal Two FAD missions visited Bhutan (in April 1982 and June 1983) to provide assistance on tax policy, budgeting and accounting. A FAD expert participated in the Legal Department mission in April 1984. In November 1984, an expert from the FAD panel was assigned as General Fiscal Advisor to the Ministry of Finance. The assignment was extended for two more years. A new General Fiscal Advisor began a one-year term in April 1988; this assignment was subsequently extended through October 1989. A three-member technical assistance mission, which visited Bhutan during November-December 1987, completed a report on the tax system and public enterprises; a follow-up mission visited Bhutan during July 1989. A technical assistance mission on income taxation visited Bhutan in June 1992. C. Legal Several visits by a staff member of the Legal Department took place during 1982-84 in connection with the drafting of tax legislation. d.

While agriculture received the bulk of the assistance in the earlier periods, more recent activity has focused on developing financial institutions and statistical management system, and strengthening institutional capacity in road and energy sectors. Specific projects have included the development of a National Pension Board, the establishment of the country’s second commercial bank, the promotion of private sector in road maintenance and the corporatization of Department of Power. In January 1999, the Asian Development Bank agreed to make an equity investment of US$28 1,000 in the Bhutan National Bank (formerly the Unit Trust of Bhutan). This has been the only equity participation in Bhutan to date.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Bhutan On May 7, 2001, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Bhutan.’ Background Bhutan has adopted a cautious approach to economic development. A careful balance has been struck between modernizing Bhutan and preserving the pristine environment and traditional culture. Although exploitation of the natural resource and tourist potential has been tightly controlled, the economy has enjoyed rapid GDP growth over the past two decades, with dramatic improvements made in social indicators. For the past two years, growth has been robust and inflation has been moderate in Bhutan. Although southern Bhutan was affected by floods in August 2000, GDP is expected to grow by 6 percent in 2000/01 (year ending June), much the same rate as in 1999/2000. The economy is increasingly dominated by the hydropower sector, and the building of new power projects has led to double-digit growth in the construction and transport sectors. The inflation rate declined from 12 percent at end-l 998 to 3% percent by June 2000 in line with moderating food prices, but picked up to 4% percent by December 2000 as a result of increases in administered fuel prices. The Bhutanese authorities have avoided borrowing to finance recurrent expenditures and have maintained the current fiscal balance in surplus. Nonetheless, the overall deficit (including foreign grants) doubled to 4 percent of GDP in 1999/2000, primarily reflecting a pick-up in capital spending once the 8th Five-Year Plan (1997/98-2001/02) ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the May 7,200l Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

The deficit is expected to rise slightly to 4%5 percent of GDP in 2000/01 as a result of expenditure to rebuild flood-damaged infrastructure. Despite the rise in electricity exports, the current account deficit widened in 1999/2000. This was due to construction of the new power projects, which led to a surge in capital equipment imports and rising factor service payments. The current account deficit is projected to remain high for the same reasons in 2000/01. However, increased foreign aid, particularly from India associated with the Tala power project, has provided more than commensurate financing and has kept the balance of payments in substantial surplus. Foreign reserves (three quarters of which are in convertible currencies) increased to $309 million at end-September 2000, representing a year and a half of imports, and about 180 percent of total external debt. The debt service ratio is estimated at 5% percent in 1999/2000. Large balance of payments surpluses have led to rapid money growth, but credit expansion has been sluggish. Reserve money increased by 50 percent in the two years ending June 2000, almost exactly equal to the buildup in the Royal Monetary Authority’s (RMA) net foreign assets over the same period. Broad money growth averaged about 20 percent per annum during 1998/99 and 1999/2000, but credit to the private sector grew by only 5 percent per annum. The increase in bank deposits was largely held as excess reserves with the RMA or on deposit with the State Bank of India. Exclusive of consumer loans, credit to the private sector credit fell by 10 percent in the two years ending June 2000. Slow credit growth apparently reflects a cautious lending culture in the two commercial banks combined with a shortage of investment opportunities. Bhutan has undertaken important structural reforms over the past few years, which have included: corporatizing government departments (telecommunications); abolishing state monopolies (petroleum distribution): privatizing public enterprises (trade, cement, banks); and providing the legislative building blocks necessary for a modern commercial economy. Nonetheless, there are limited signs to date of growth in the private sector, or of diversification in the economy. Lending to the private sector and nonelectricity exports remain depressed, while GDP growth is heavily dependent on sectors that create little domestic employment. Executive Board Assessment <Begin Typing Here> Public hformation Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF’s assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
