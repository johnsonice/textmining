Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Ireland were held in Dublin during March 31-April 10. The staff team L/ met with Minister for Finance Quinn, Central Bank Governor O'Connell, other senior officials, and representatives of the social partners and the financial and academic communities. Mr. Murphy (Alternate Executive Director) also participated. At the last consultation in June 1994 (EBM/94/51), Directors commended the authorities for a disciplined and outward-looking economic strategy that had contributed to robust growth with low inflation. Nevertheless, public debt remained high, budgetary expenditures were supported by European Union (EU) funds of doubtful sustainability, and high unemployment seemed impervious to rapid growth. Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the favorable economic climate to accelerate fiscal consolidation and implement structural reforms designed to increase employment and reduce market rigidities. Following the collapse of the Fianna Fail/Labour coalition, a new government of Fine Gael, Labour, and Democratic Left was formed in December 1994. The periodicity, timeliness, coverage, and quality of Ireland's economic data are adequate for effective surveillance (Statistical Annex). II. Economic Background Since 1987, financial restraint anchored by participation in the ERM has contributed to a favorable economic performance. Supported by buoyant exports and EU transfers (about 5 percent of GNP), Ireland's growth has exceeded EU and OECD averages; the relative inflation record has been equally good; and the external position has been considerably strengthened (Table 1 and Charts 1 and 2). Fiscal deficits have been contained at moderate levels --in marked contrast with earlier double-digit deficits (Chart 3)--and the Exchequer debt/GNP ratio reduced from well above 100 percent (Table 2). There remain nevertheless several concerns. The currency turbulence of recent months has again brought into relief the tension between ERM membership and the Irish pound's longstanding ties with sterling; the opportunity to further strengthen the public finances is not being fully exploited; unemployment- -while declining--remains high, and the large external surplus partly reflects a relatively low rate of domestic investment (see Chart 2). I/ The mission comprised Messrs. Fetherston (Head), Ordoobadi, Arnason, CatHo, and Mrs. Phillips (Administrative Assistant) (all EUl).

Prior to the September 1992 ERM turmoil, Ireland's exchange rate anchor as a narrow band ERM member contributed to a steady decline in interest rate differentials with the deutsche mark (Chart 4). Following sterling's departure from the ERM, the Irish pound came under pressure that culminated in a 10 percent devaluation in January 1993. Interest rates were eased in the wake of the devaluation, and the central bank further reduced its short- term facility (STF) rate from 7 percent to 6% percent during January-May 1994. The Irish pound appreciated in 1994 vis-a-vis sterling, the U.S. dollar, and on a trade-weighted basis; it depreciated against the deutsche mark, while remaining within the former narrow band (Chart 5). In the more turbulent conditions of early 1995, the Irish pound declined sharply against the deutsche mark from near its ERM central rate in early January to a low of 9.3 percent below the central rate on March 17. The STF rate was increased by 50 basis points on March 3 and again by the same amount on March 9. The authorities also engaged in market intervention that contributed to a decline in reserves of about US$35 million to USS6.15 billion at end-March. On March 19, the Minister for Finance issued a statement indicating that it would be appropriate for the Irish pound to trade more comfortably within the ERM and that this would require that the Irish pound trade above parity with sterling. As of June 8, the value of the Irish pound had recove,red to 5 percent below the central rate and stood about 2 percent above parity with sterling. In nominal effective terms, the Irish pound has depreciated by about 0.8 percent in 1995. Competitiveness remains favorable (see Chart S), u although the position of traditional sectors competing in the U.K. market has weakened with the appreciation against sterling. u Long-term interest rate differentials against both sterling and the deutsche mark widened a little in late 1994 at the time of the change of government. Private sector credit and broad monev both increased by about 11 percent in 1994, with the resurgence in credit demand being led by residential mortgages. The growth in private sector credit increased to 13 percent at end-March 1995. The Excheauer Borrowing Reauirement (EBR) narrowed to 2.2 percent of GNP in 1994 as strong economic growth contributed to a surge in revenues. The previous government's objective of reducing the debt/GNP ratio to 95 percent or less by 1996 was achieved ahead of schedule, as the debt ratio fell to 94 percent at end-IL994 (compared with its 1987 peak of 124 percent). Lurking beneath the ostensibly strong fiscal performance is rapid growth in noninterest current expenditures (about 8% percent per annum on average during 1989-94), particularly on social services. u The effective exchange rate based on unit labor costs is distorted by the shift in production to the highly productive foreign-owned sector. 2/ The United Kingdom accounts for about 30 percent of Irish trade.

Employment rose by 3 percent, and the unemnlovment rate declined to 14.8 percent (Chart 6). Nevertheless, the Irish unemployment rate remains among the highest in the OECD, reflecting (i) strong labor force growth associated with demographic trends and migration flows and (ii) policy-related factors--tax and welfare systems that discourage job seeking and employment creation, labor market rigidities, and a development strategy that has favored capital-intensive, export-oriented sectors. Meanwhile the labor-intensive agriculture and crafts sectors have declined, to the cost of the unskilled who account for the bulk of the long-term unemployed (two thirds of the total). Wage increases are negotiated under a centralized multi-year framework established in 1987. The third agreement under the system, concluded in January 1994, provides for private sector pay increases of 2 percent in 1994, 2% percent in 1995, and 3% percent in 1996. The quid pro quo for wage restraint is a government commitment to personal income tax concessions and higher spending on social services. Inflation rose in 1994, mainly reflecting remaining passthrough effects associated with the January 1993 devaluation. Consumer prices increased by 2.3 percent and the underlying inflation rate, excluding mortgage interest payments, averaged 3 percent, up from 2 percent in 1993. As of February 1995, the 12-month underlying rate was 2.7 percent. v In the latest official proiections presented in February, real GNP was forecast to increase by 5L percent in 1995, with the external current account surplus little changed at 7% percent of GNP. Buoyant domestic demand coupled with expanded special employment schemes and increased public employment were projected to generate net employment growth of 2.6 percent. Consumer price inflation was projected to remain at about 2% percent. However, the staff sees some rise in underlying inflation toward 3 percent as likely in light of the recent effective depreciation of the Irish pound. Over the medium term, Irish growth rates are likely to moderate (Table 3), but nevertheless remain well above EU averages as a result of Ireland's strong competitive position, growth in the working age population, further increases in factor productivity, and additional foreign direct investment. Ireland will receive substantial EU transfers through 1999, although prospects thereafter are uncertain. The staff sees the large 1/ GNP, which excludes the profits of foreign firms, nets out distortions arising from transfer pricing by foreign firms operating in Ireland; it is consequently the preferred indicator of output in Ireland. See also the background paper. 2/ The consumer price index is compiled for the middle month of each quarter.

The prospective decline in EU transfers, particularly after 1999, would also tend to reduce the external surplus. III. Policv Discussions The authorities emphasized that three pillars--price stability, currency stability, and fiscal discipline- -underpinned their strategy for promoting competitiveness, growth, and employment. The discussions focused on strains to these pillars arising from recent currency market turbulence and rapid public expenditure growth. The authorities explained that the primary objective of monetary and exchange rate oolicv remained price stability, with the longer term objective of being among the first group of countries to enter into European Monetary Union (EMU). In view of the small size and openness of the Irish economy--total trade is equivalent to well over 100 percent of GNP--exchange rate stability was a key intermediate goal. In the new policy environment created by the 1993 widening of the ERM bands, the authorities had announced the objective that the Irish pound should perform, vis-a-vis the deutsche mark, at least as well as other former narrow band currencies. The staff representatives observed that the operational status of the objective expressed in terms of other former narrow band currencies appeared unclear, as Ireland had languished at or near the bottom of the ERM grid for much of 1995. Also, sizable deviations of the Irish pound from its central rate could lead to a loss of credibility. In response, the authorities explained that, because of Ireland's trade links with the United Kingdom and the tendency of the currency markets to mark down the Irish pound in tandem with sterling, steep declines in sterling- -such as those of early 1995-- posed an awkward dilemma for exchange rate management. 2J The authorities expressed dissatisfaction with the opening up of a significant gap between the Irish pound and most other former narrow band currencies, which they did not consider to be justified by fundamentals. They stressed that it was not their intention-- nor would it be desirable--under all circumstances to track the deutsche mark or other former narrow band currencies through the use of interest rates or intervention. Ramping up short-term interest rates for - lJ The current account surplus may be somewhat overstated because Ireland's external accounts do not include under factor outflows the unrepatriated profits of foreign firms. Based on tentative estimates of the share of these profits that are retained, this overstatement could be on the order of 2 percent of GNP. The authorities are preparing modifications to balance of payments ccmpilation procedures that would address this issue. 2J The determinants of the Irish pound/sterling exchange rate are analyzed in a background paper.

Moreover, too rapid an appreciation of the Irish pound against sterling, even if one could be contrived, would undercut the competitiveness of low-margin traditional exporters dependent upon the United Kingdom's market. Since the March turbulence was divorced from the fundamentals of the Irish economy, the sterling-inspired fall in the Irish pound could as easily (and capriciously) be reversed. The authorities observed that their response to the March turbulence-- increased interest rates, intervention, and the stated desire for improved performance in the ERM--had already contributed to a partial recovery of the Irish pound against other narrow band currencies and to a gradual appreciation against sterling. The staff representatives acknowledged the risks associated with efforts to secure a sharp appreciation of the Irish pound, while questioning whether the .March policy tightening had been sufficient in relation to domestic inflation objectives, given the strength of activity and the effective depreciation of the Irish pound. The authorities responded that tlheir policy decisions would continue to be guided by the objective of price stability, with 3 percent considered by the Central Bank as an (unannounced) upper limit for inflation. They noted that the full effects of the March tightening had yet to be felt, and that the effective depreciation of the Irish pound had been relatively modest. However, if private sector credit growth failed to moderate in response to the March tightening or if incipient price pressures--including those ? emanating from currency developments--manifested themselves, further increases in the STF rate would be made. The authorities observed that a disciplined fiscal ~olicv lJ had been successfully implemented: past imbalances had been reduced and Ireland was one of two EU countries not cited in 1.994 under the excessive deficit procedure of the Maastricht treaty. They recognized that the heavy debt burden rendered the public finances vulnerable to adverse shocks and limited the latitude for needed tax reform to promote employment growth. Continued rapid debt reduction therefore remained a key objective of fiscal policy, but one that would not be allowed to interfere with other goals: too rapid a decline in the debt burden would limit the scope for tax reform and might unduly dampen economic growth. To contain the pressure on expenditure that had emerged since 1989, the authorities had announced their commitment to contain noninterest current expenditure growth to 6 percent in nominal terms in 1995 and to 2 percent in real terms during 1996-97. The 1995 budget targets an EBR of 2.4 percent of GNP (up from 2.2 percent in 1994) and a reduction in the public debt to GNP ratio of 1/ A review of budgetary issues, performance, and prospects is provided in a'background paper.

The authorities acknowledged that the 1995 budget had benefitted from one-off factors (equivalent to 0.8 percent of GNP) and that the full-year costs of the revenue and expenditure measures introduced in the 1995 budget (of 1.8 percent of GNP) would reduce future room for maneuver. Nevertheless, their preliminary calculations showed that on current policies, including the announced limits on current expenditure growth, the budget deficit in 1996 would remain within the Maastricht ceiling (see tabulation). The staff expressed reservations about the adoption of an expansionary budget in the midst of an upswing, and regretted that an opportunity for greater progress on debt reduction had thus been missed. Moreover, the concern that more rapid debt reduction would unduly dampen growth seemed unwarranted given the strength of the upswing. Looking forward, even with the announced intentions to restrain spending, the margin for further tax reform and to cope with adverse shocks appeared limited. u Budgetary Indicators, 1994-96 1994 1995 1996 Budget Outturn Budget Proi, (In percent of GNP) Exchequer borrowing requirement 2.6 2.2 2.4 3.0 Exchequer debt . . . 94.3 89.4 86.6 (In percent of GDP) General government deficit I-J 2.8 2.3 2.7 2.7 General government debt I/ . . . 90.0 84.8 80.8 Source: Data provided by the Irish authorities and staff calculations.

The authorities stressed that this court-ordered expenditure would be excluded from the base used for the 2 percent real ceiling on future spending growth. While welcoming the emphasis on expenditure restraint, the staff expressed concern alt the fiscal implications of deferred and contingent liabilities (s,uch as the court-ordered welfare payment, possible compensation to recipients of tainted blood transfusions, and the reimbursement of EU livestock intervention receipts, which in total could amount to as much as 1 percent of GNP I-J) as well as the periodic restructuring expenses of public enterprises. 2J The staff observed that these potential liabilities underscored the need for budgetary planning that would provide a margin to handle contingencies. 'The 1995 budget introduced a number of tax reform measures aimed at incre.asing the take home pay of low-income wage earners and reducing the tax burde:n imposed on job creation. The reform measures, targeted primarily at low-income wage earners, increased general exemption limits and personal allowances, widened the standard tax band, and raised the exemption for social security (PRSI) taxes. In order to promote enterprise and encourage employment creation, the income threshold for employer PRSI payments was increased, the standard corporation tax rate reduced from 40 percent to 38 percent, J/ tax breaks for start-up firms expanded, and the capital gains tax changed to facilitate the transfer of assets and family businesses. The authorities indicated that these initiatives were part of an ongoing process guided by the objectives of targeting lower paid workers and new job entrants, ensuring that only those on higher incomes were subject to taxes above the standard rate, reducing tax relief on mortgage interest and voluntary health premiums, and improving the tax collection system. The authorities observed, however, that the bias in the tax code against employment was difficult to correct, although the government was committed to further narrowing the large differential between the standard and preferential corporation tax rates as resources permitted. There was, however, strong political resistance to the expansion of the taxation of property and the range of products subJect to VAT. Moreover, the free trade in goclds within the EU limited the scope for increasing VAT and excise tax rates, while the taxation of interest income was limited by the risk of driving deposits offshore. I-J The amounts involved for compensation to blood recipients and for EU reimbursement are subject to judicial decision and discussion with the EU, respectively, and are therefore uncertain. 2J During 1993-94, budgetary transfers to public enterprises to service debt, cover losses, and restructure pension liabilities amounted to ti percent of GNP per arnum. 3J Profits in manufacturing and certain international financial services are taxed at a 10 percent rate.

The pace of job creation had been brisk in recent years, with private sector employment increasing by one quarter during 1986-94. However, the projected continued rapid growth in the labor force and the potential for this growth to accelerate as a result of rising female participation from present low levels meant that rapid employment generation was necessary just to avert a deterioration in the unemployment rate. They observed that, as a consequence of these factors and the potentially large migration flows in either direction, the concept of a stable NAIRU could not readily be applied to Ireland. The authorities viewed the multi-year centralized wage agreements negotiated with the main social partners as an essential tool to ensure wage moderation and help reduce unemployment by promoting competitiveness. The wage restraint embedded in these agreements was made palatable to labor by tax reform aimed at increasing the take home pay of low-income workers. In response to the staff representatives' misgivings about possible relative wage rigidity arising from such centralized wage agreements, the authorities indicated that since there were no minimum wage provisions, the current system did not impose any real cost. A decentralized approach might be less successful in curtailing wage pressure, with far more serious implications for job creation. The authorities indicated that they were also pursuing a number of specific initiatives to address the unemployment problem. First, phased tax reform measures implemented since 1987 (including those in the 1995 budget) had led to a reduction in the average tax wedge from 43 percent of total employer labor cost to 37 percent. They agreed that further tax reform measures were required, however, particularly in view of the high marginal tax wedge. Second, employment counseling, training, and placement programs were being integrated and focused in local employment service centers charged with lifting the long-term unemployed into lasting jobs. Third, vocational training standards were being improved and employers encouraged to provide opportunities for employees to upgrade skills. Fourth, efforts were in train to ensure that measures intended to relieve poverty did not also distort employment incentives. In this regard, the problem of high replacement ratios was being addressed by changing the eligibility basis for dependency benefits from employment to income status, a process initiated in the 1995 budget. The ongoing study of the integration of the tax and social welfare systems was expected to identify further initiatives along these lines. The authorities explained that while there is no explicit target for the external current account, the goal of reducing the external public debt burden would--other things being equal-- imply a continuation of current Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- '12 - account surpluses I/ into the medium term. There would be no difficulty with a reduction in the surplus that arose from increased private sector investment as opposed to higher public demand or an unsustainable rise in private consumption. The staff representatives agreed that it would be desirable to reduce the large external surplus through higher domestic private investment; this would entail not only stability-oriented macroeconomic policies, but also structural reforms to address distortions that appeared to be impeding domestic investment. u These distortions are associated with a number of factors, including the longstanding focus of industry and tax policy on attracting export-oriented foreign direct investment and high business costs associated with the operation of monopoly public enterprises. The authorities responded that efforts were underway to shift the emphasis of industry policy toward domestic firms. Also, public enterprises, which employ about 6 percent of the workforce, were being given clear commercial mandates and financial benchmarks against which to measure performance. Particular attention was being given to increasing the efficiency, reducing the fees, and improving the service provided by monopolistic public utilities. The authorities indicated that the increasing competitive pressures on public enterprises would be managed so as to balance the interests of employees, taxpayers, and consumers. They also noted that in 1995 the Competition Authority would be given powers to act against anticompetitive behavior on its own initiative. As regards privatization, the authorities are preparing to sell most or all of their remaining shares ,in Irish Life. 1/ Further full-scale privatization is not on the agenda for political reasons: the policy statement of the new coalition government declares that state assets would not be sold unless such dispositions protected employment and were in the long-term strategic interest of the company and its stakeholders, and that even if these conditions were met majority state ownership would be retained. The staff representatives observed that attempts to balance competing interests might detract from efficiency, and encouraged a more active approach to public enterprise reform and full privatization. 1/ Data limitations complLcate the analysis of the capital account counterpart of this surplus, which has in recent years been reflected in private outflows in the form of profit repatriations of multinational companies and investments abroad by Irish institutions, in part reflecting portfolio diversification following the removal of capital controls in 1993. 2/ The small size of Ireland's domer.tic market and the country's peripheral geographic location are also factors influencing domestic investment. 3J Such a sale was originally envisaged for 1994, but was deferred in light of market conditions.

Bank capital was well above minimum requirements, reflecting strong profitability, low loan losses, and a conservative banking tradition. The longstanding presence of foreign institutions, which was destined to expand as a result of EU-inspired liberalization measures, promoted efficiency. A Central Bank survey of the use of derivatives by Irish financial institutions completed in September 1994 had revealed nothing alarming, as most derivatives activity was limited to the arranging of forward currency contracts for clients. In the Irish government bond (IGB) market, u fixed commissions had been eliminated as a means of increasing competition among traders. In addition, the authorities were considering the introduction of a system of primary brokers in the IGB market with the view to improving its liquidity and efficiency. The authorities viewed the conclusion of the Uruzuav Round with satisfaction as they expected the ensuing liberalization in the trade regime to be, over time, a boon to Ireland's open, export-oriented economy. 2J However, the implementation of the CAP reform and the Uruguay Round would lead to a further decline in agricultural employment and output. In response, the authorities were encouraging a shift from commodity production to more processed and higher value added goods, an approach meeting with some success. IV. Staff Annraisal Ireland's economy has performed well in recent years. Since the late 198Os, the pursuit of a disciplined and outward-looking economic strategy has reduced macroeconomic imbalances and created a climate conducive to robust growth, low inflation, and ample external surpluses. A number of issues and challenges remain, however. First, the recent currency turbulence has highlighted the tension between ERM membership and the Irish economy's close links with the United Kingdom. Second, the rapid pace of public expenditure growth has limited the scope for debt reduction and further tax reform to improve the incentives to seek and create employment. Finally, unemployment remains a major--largely structural-- problem, despite rapid employment growth. The weakness of the Irish pound against the deutsche mark in early 1995 highlights the exposure of the Irish economy to economic and financial developments in the United Kingdom, and the challenge of establishing the credibility of the objective of early EMU entry. It is understandable that lJ Changes in the Irish government bond market are reviewed in a background paper. 2J An analysis of the anticipated impact of the implementation of the Uruguay Round on the main sectors of the Irish economy is provided in a background paper.

In these circumstances, the focus of monetary policy on the objective of price stability has been useful. However, :in light of the objective of early entry into EMU, the staff is of the view that a progressively greater weight should be given to bringing the exchange rate in line with its central rate in the ERM. This process should pose no inconsistencies with the low inflation objective. The tightening of monetary policy in March was justified on both domestic and external grounds; indeed, more might have been done. Looking ahead, given the continued buoyancy of credit and domestic demand and the expansionary stance of fiscal policy, further tightening would be prudent, both to maintain low inf:Lation and to allow the Irish pound to trade more comfortably within the ERM. At present exchange rates, Ireland's overall competitive position is :Eavorable; indeed, the large external surplus suggest that there is scope for the Irish pound to appreciate. The strengthening of fiscal discipline in recent years is commendable, but the debt burden resulting from earlier imbalances remains severe, and the long-term outlook is clouded by uncertain prospects for EU funds. The authorities have scrupulously observed the Maastricht deficit ceiling, but fiscal policy has become procyclical: the 1995 budget, while appropriately including further tax reform measures aimed at reducing distortions and improving the incentives to seek and create jobs, was expansionary during a period of stron,g growth. In implementing the 1995 budget, every-- sustainable-- effort should therefore be made to achieve an EBR below that targeted. In framing the 1996 budget, a number of competing goals will need to be balanced: the need to return the deficit to a downward path consistent with rapid debt reduction that would help prepare for the eventual decline of EU funding and reduce vulnerability to shocks; the desirability of further tax reform; and the merits of addres'sing the overhang of deferred liabilities and the restructuring expenses of public enterprises. Expenditure restraint is the fulcrum that can 'balance these competing goals. The adoption by the authorities of an average annual real ceiling of 2 percent on noninterest current expenditure growth during 1996-97 represents a step in the right direction. Given the pressures on the budget arising in part from the measures adopted in 1995, there is no scope for slippage from this objective, and the early specification and frontloading of expenditure measures would enhance its credibility. Tight limits on expenditure should be accompanied by measures to expand the revenue base through further progress in reducing tax expenditures and the more effective imposition of taxes on property. These steps would provide scope for further tax reform measures aimed at promoting employment growth. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - Public enterprise reform has progressed at a modest pace, and the hurdles established even for partial privatization appear high. This is regrettable as the accumulated losses of uneconomic public enterprises weigh on the budget, while those earning monopolistic profits do so at the expense of the rest of the economy. A more vigorous approach, featuring much greater emphasis on privatization, is therefore needed and would also enhance the climate for channelling savings into domestic investment. The preservation of uneconomic public sector jobs will not resolve Ireland's unemployment problem. Although recent rapid employment growth is welcome, the high unemployment rate remains a cause for concern. The need to confront the emergence of a hard core of long-term unemployed and a culture of dependence that passes from generation to generation is urgent. The authorities' three-pronged approach to reducing unemployment--fostering a stable macroeconomic environment, tax reform, and the initiation of programs to lift the long-term unemployed into lasting jobs--is broadly appropriate. However, more needs to be done to increase labor market flexibility and improve the prospects of the unemployed, specifically by reducing the high replacement ratios and tax wedges that deter job search and creation, narrowing the bias in the tax code against the labor-intensive indigenous service sector, adopting more flexible work practices, reforming employee protection legislation, and allowing greater flexibility for relative wages to match demand and supply conditions than is provided by the current wage determination framework. Without important progress in these areas, the return on the authorities' substantial investment in active labor market programs --as measured by the number of long-term unemployed finding paid employment-- will be limited. The efforts of the regulatory authorities to adopt best international practice in their supervisi,on of financial institutions and the promotion of competition as a spur to efficiency are welcome. The adoption of a primary broker system for the IGB market will necessitate redoubled vigilance in the monitoring of the trading, risk-management practices, and capital adequacy of brokers, whose need for hedging vehicles may well also lead to a more active futures market. Ireland's medium-term prospects appear favorable. The relative youth of the population and the scope for increases in factor productivity should, with macroeconomic and structural policies to help raise the relatively low rate of domestic investment, support a rate of growth that lifts Ireland's per capita income further toward the EU average. Policies that support higher domestic investment- -including steps to reduce business costs through public enterprise reform and privatization and a strengthened competition policy- -would also help address staff concerns over the external surplus, which appears large given Ireland's relative per capita income position and level of unemployment.

There was a deterioration in the quality and timeliness of trade and capital account data after 1993 arising, respectively, from EU single market initiatives and the lifting of Ireland's exchange controls. These are being addressed through the refinement of new survey-based systems that should improve the quality and timeliness of these data. Consumer price data and Ireland's national income accounts are now compiled, respectively, on a quarterly and an annual basis. It would be desirable to develop monthly consumer price data and quarterly national income accounts. Transfer pricing by foreign firms attempting to take advantage of low taxes is the source of limited distortion in the output and trade data. To the extent that profits associated with transfer pricing are remitted as factor income payments, GNP is not affected and is consequently a more reliable indicator of Irish output than GDP. A residual distortion may remain in the form of unrepatriated profits which are not included in net factor income; this issue is being addressed in the context of revisions to balance of payments compilation procedures.
