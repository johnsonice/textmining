The mission met with Minister for Finance and Economic Management Iatika, Reserve Bank Governor Kausiama, and other senior government officials. The mission also met with representatives of the private sector, commercial banks, and major donors. The staff team comprised Messrs. Greene (head-INS), Aziz, Nishigaki (both APD), and Ms. Wang (TRE). Mr. Hililan (OED) participated in part of the discussions. D The economy appears to be recovering from the recession of 1999, but the balance of payments remains fragile, and economic growth is likely to decline over the medium term without further structural reforms. Vanuatu also faces a fiscal gap over the medium term that will require expenditure restraint and a broadening of the narrow tax base. l Vanuatu has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Vanuatu is on a 24-month consultation cycle. l Data deficiencies complicate the job of conducting surveillance. There are weaknesses in the quality of balance of payments data, while official data on the national accounts are not available beyond 1995. Data on monetary aggregates, reserves, and inflation are reported regularly to the Fund, although the consumer price index is measured only quarterly and appears with a three-month lag. Despite these deficiencies, the staff believes that the available data and estimates allow a broad assessment of economic developments and policies. l Messrs. Greene and Aziz were the principal contributors to this report.

Nevertheless, the authorities have maintained macroeconomic stability, keeping inflation low and avoiding large reserve losses. Economic growth has been modest, however, and the balance of payments has remained fragile. 0 The economic outlook for 2000 is mixed, and over the medium term the situation is not expected to improve significantly. During 2000 the economy is forecast to experience a modest recovery with low inflation, although the balance of payments is projected to worsen further. The fiscal position is also difficult, due to a likely shortfall in revenue and a delay in receiving foreign financing. Over the medium term, per capita real GDP is likely to stagnate, with a rising fiscal gap and little strengthening of the balance of payments, absent i%rther structural and fiscal reforms. 0 To enhance growth potential, the government has made higher health and education spending a priority and will undertake a comprehensive review of the present, narrowly-based tax system. In addition, the mission has advised the authorities to introduce more transparency in the current exchange rate regime and keep it under review. 0 Progress in implementing the Comprehensive Reform Program (CRP) has slowed since mid-1999, and the release of the second tranche of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) loan supporting the CRP has been delayed. The delay occurred after the passage of two bills-supported by the government-that the AsDB considers would undermine key governance objectives of the program. A number of other conditionalities also remain to be fulfilled. A recent AsDB mission helped clarify issues, and the tranche could be released in October after an AsDB review in August. a The authorities acknowledged areas where laws and administration could be strengthened to deal with possible money-laundering and stated that they were moving to address these issues. They also noted the need for greater information sharing and coordination between the Financial Services Commission, which supervises the offshore center, and the Reserve Bank. 0 Vanuatu continues to have weaknesses in national accounts and balance of payments statistics. The mission urged the authorities to implement their plan to publish national accounts data for 1996-99 this year and recommended that they seek technical assistance to resolve important questions in balance of payments statistics.

Economic performance in Vanuatu, as in many other Pacific Island economies, has been disappointing over the past decade. Per capita GDP, estimated at US$l ,106 in 1999, has stagnated and illiteracy remains high, with real GDP barely keeping with pace population growth. Compounding the difficulties has been an unstable political situation, with five changes of government since November 1995. The most recent change occurred in November 1999, when the current government led by Barak Sope of the Melanesian Progressive Party, took office. Despite these problems, macroeconomic stability has been maintained, with inflation moderate and international reserves above 5 months of imports. 2. In the two years following the last Article IV consultation, Vanuatu has faced a variety of economic challenges. After an estimated 6 percent increase in 1998, real GDP fell by an estimated 2% percent in 1999, reflecting unfavorable weather and delays in major infrastructure projects that reduced public investment (Table 1 and Figure 1). Agricultural output, which accounts for about 25 percent of GDP, appears to have fallen by more than 11 percent due to a major cyclone and excess rainfall. At the same time, CPI inflation slowed to 2% percent from 3% percent a year earlier, as the one-time effects of the introduction of a VAT in 1998 wore off and economic activity remained weak. 3. Available information indicates that the current account balance moved into a deficit of 5 percent of GDP in 1999, after recording a surplus of about 12 percent of GDP in the previous year (Table 1). The shift may have reflected a decline in exports of agricultural commodities from weather-related shocks, and decreased tourist arrivals due to damage to Air Vanuatu’s aircraft. The capital and financial account, however, appeared to have moved into surplus, reflecting a large drawdown of net foreign assets by commercial banks. As a result, gross reserves fell by only USS 1?4 million and stood at US$42% million by end-1999, equivalent to 6% months of imports (Table 2). 4. The foreign exchange market has experienced intermittent pressures during the past two years. In mid-1998, following large-scale withdrawals of retirement savings from the Vanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF), which led to a substantial rise in domestic liquidity (Box l), the vatu came under intense pressure. In response, the authorities, besides raising interest rates, engineered an effective devaluation of the vatu by changing the weights of the undisclosed basket of currencies to which it was linked. Although this helped contain ’ The assessments in this report are based on official data and estimates that are subject to weaknesses, particularly in national accounts and the balance of payments, Official data on national accounts are available only through 1995, although the authorities have provided the mission with estimates for the years 1996-99. In addition, balance of payments data are subject to misclassifications that may compromise the measurement of the current account balance. Despite these limitations, the staff believes that the available data and estimates allow a broad assessment of economic developments and policies. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5 - speculative pressures, the vatu came under further stress in late 1999 from anxiety following the latest change in government, and again early in 2000. To reduce the outflow of reserves, the authorities reintroduced, in February 2000, regulations restricting access to foreign exchange for capital transactions that had been removed in October 1999. Although the trade-weighted real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated from 1997-98 to 1999, the tourism-weighted REER appreciated strongly over this period, and both measures appreciated from end-1999 through early 2000 (Figure 2, top panel). A comparison of real bilateral exchange rates vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar also suggests that Vanuatu may have lost competitiveness since 1998 relative to nearby countries with which it competes in tourism (Figure 2, middle panel). 5. Despite a decline in tax revenue due to the economic slowdown, the fiscal deficit in 1999 was less than budgeted, reflecting delays in infrastructure projects and tighter controls on current expenditure. Tax revenue decreased by the equivalent of 1 percent of GDP, but was more than offset by a decline in current expenditure and a 43/4 percent of GDP shortfall in spending on infrastructure projects due to delays in project implementation (Table 3 and Figure 3). Thus, the overall budget deficit fell to 1% percent of GDP in 1999 from about 11 percent of GDP in 1998 and was about 4% percent of GDP smaller than budgeted.2 6. Monetary conditions, which were tightened after the VNPF crisis in mid-1998, were somewhat relaxed in the latter half of 1999 as activity weakened. Nominal interest rates, which rose sharply in mid-1998, decreased in 1999 as the Reserve Bank expanded vatu liquidity by repurchasing Reserve Bank notes, and private sector credit grew modestly. While broad money denominated in vatu fell by 6% percent (Table 4), total broad money dropped by 9% percent, reflecting a decline in commercial banks’ net foreign assets3 7. Several changes have also been made in the framework for conducting monetary policy during the last two years. To absorb the liquidity injected by the withdrawals from the VNPF and aid the sale of govemment bonds, in early 1998 the authorities replaced the 10 percent statutory reserve deposit (SRD) requirement with a 16 percent prescribed reserve asset requirement (PRA), toward which the banks could count their holdings of government bonds. Around the same time, the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) began issuing its own notes. In late 1998, a repurchase facility, covering short-term government bonds and RBV notes, was introduced to provide more efficient liquidity management. In April 1999, the 2 Much of the high deficit in 1998 reflected one-time spending, such as the rehabilitation of state-owned financial institutions and payouts from the VNPF (equal to 4% percent of GDP). 3 Much of the decline in commercial banks’ net foreign assets took place in the fourth quarter of 1999 and was largely reversed during the first quarter of 2000. This fluctuation may have reflected a few large transactions by the banks. Net foreign assets of the Reserve Bank continued to decline through the first quarter of 2000, however, reflecting pressures on the exchange rate (see paragraph 5). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6 - RBV abolished the PRA and raised the SRD, which was reintroduced in late 1998, to 10 percent of average vatu deposits plus 5 percent of foreign currency demand deposits. These moves did not have much impact on the stance of monetary policy, although excess reserves have declined. 8. Activity in the offshore financial center remained weak in 1999. Total turnover in the sector fell by 10 percent in 1999. Much of this decline may have reflected allegations of money laundering levied against some offshore institutions, which led several major international banks to ban U.S. dollar transactions with Vanuatu (Vanuatu has been rated as a Category III country-low quality of supervision- in a recent Financial Stability Forum report). Some of these banks have since resumed U.S. dollar transactions with certain institutions. A mission from the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) visited Vanuatu in early 2000 to assess the country’s efforts to combat money laundering, and the mission’s report is expected to be released soon. 9. Progress in implementing the Comprehensive Reform Program (CRP), initiated in 1997 with the support of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) and bilateral donors (Box 2), has slowed since mid-1999, and the release of the second tranche of the AsDB loan supporting the CRP has been delayed. A key reason for the delay in second tranche release has been parliamentary passage of two private members’ bills, supported by the new government and now under review by the Supreme Court. These bills would allow the Prime Minister, as well as the Public Service Commission, to terminate Directors General (the top civil servants) in each ministry; subordinate the Directors General to the Ministers’ political advisors; and repeal some other reforms enacted earlier under the CRP. In the view of the AsDB, these changes would undermine important governance objectives of the program. In addition, several conditions for second tranche release appear to be un~lfllled (Box 2). 10. At the end of the 1998 consultation, Executive Directors strongly supported Vanuatu’s efforts to implement a wide range of economic reforms under the CRP as a way to raise its potential growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Directors stressed that mutually reinforcing financial policy adjustments and structural reforms would be essential to achieve higher growth. Since that time the authorities have restructured the National Bank of Vanuatu (NBV) and liquidated the Development Bank of Vanuatu (DBV). II. OUTLOOK 11. In recent months, there have been signs that Vanuatu will experience a modest recovery this year, driven by a rebound in agricultural production, resumption of delayed infrastructure projects, and some growth in tourism. Under present policies, the staff estimates growth this year to reach 4 percent. However, the recovery is unlikely to be broad based, with activity in other sectors remaining largely flat, reflecting low private sector confidence. With a stable exchange rate regime and the low inflation rates projected for trading partner countries, Vanuatu’s inflation rate is expected to remain around 2 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7 - 12. The external position is less certain. The current account balance is expected to improve, with higher imports-reflecting a turnaround in activity and higher infmstructure investment-being more than offset by an even greater rise in exports and service receipts coming from increased earnings in the coconut sector, following the start of production at the coconut oil mill, and a recovery in tourism. However, the financial account could worsen if the net foreign assets of commercial banks continue to rise, as happened in the first quarter. Reflecting these developments, the staff projects the balance of payments to worsen, recording a deficit of US$2 million, leaving gross reserves at 53/4 months of import cover at year end. This deficit could be larger if a halt in coconut oil production that began late in May is prolonged.4 13. The fiscal position is also difficult. The budget envisages a deficit of 63/4 percent of GDP, reflecting the completion of development projects postponed from 1999, for which foreign financing has been identified. However, lower transfers from asset sales by the Asset Management Unit (AMU), established to recover bad debts from the VNPF and the now defunct Vanuatu Development Bank, are likely to depress revenue by 1% percent of GDP relative to the budget forecast, although other revenue sources are thus far performing as projected. This shortfall will occur largely because the AMU’s outstanding debt service obligations will preclude it from transferring significant funds to the budget. On the assumption that the government secures all the foreign financing envisaged in the budget, including the US$5 million (2% percent of GDP) second tranche of the AsDB loan supporting the CRP, domestic financing would be limited to the amount of the revenue shortfall. Nevertheless, the revenue shortfall has created pressures to contain current expenditure. 14. Over the medium term, output growth is likely to taper off. As the stimulus from the large development projects winds down, including the effects on tourism from the completion of airport projects, the real GDP growth rate is projected to decline to 3 percent or less by 2003-05 (Table 5). Moreover, without new developments to stimulate growth in exports, tourism, or foreign investment, the external balance is unlikely to improve much over the medium term (Table 6). At the same time, Vanuatu has few other signs of immediate external vulnerability. For example, at end-1999, external debt was less than 40 percent of GDP, and the foreign currency exposure of commercial barks was relatively low (Table 7). 15. This forecast is subject to a number of downside risks. First, failure to resolve the outstanding issues surrounding the release of the second tranche of the AsDB loan for the CRP could jeopardize current and future external financing, which may limit intended development spending and hinder growth. Second, the balance of payments could worsen if ’ The halt followed a government decision denying the oil mill access to storage facilities previously authorized. Although the decision has since been reversed, the mill has reduced staff and had not resumed production as of late June. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8 - export earnings prove lower than projected, particularly if a planned expansion of the coconut oil mill is delayed or the rise in airport capacity yields less growth in tourism than expected. Third, further political uncertainty could undercut already low private sector confidence. III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 16. This year’s Article IV consultation discussions occurred at a time of heightened economic concern. While macroeconomic stability has been preserved during the past two years, and much of the CRP has been implemented, the future is worrisome. Although output should recover this year and inflation remains low, the likely slowdown in growth could mean stagnant real GDP per capita, given Vanuatu’s high rate of population growth. Moreover, the balance of payments will remain fragile, despite some improvement in exports. Against this background, the discussions focused on the appropriate stance of macroeconomic policy in the short run, and fiscal and structural polices over the medium term to raise potential growth. A. Macroeconomic Policy in the Short Run 17. The authorities argued that present policies were consistent with the recovery in output forecast for this year. While there might be some room for interest rate reduction, any decline would be limited by the balance of payments situation and the desire to maintain a broadly stable exchange rate. Moreover, historically, activity in Vanuatu has not been very interest sensitive. The staff endorsed the authorities’ approach and urged them to continue monitoring the situation closely. 18. The authorities acknowledged the fragility in the balance of payments but considered the current exchange regime and exchange rate to be appropriate. The authorities broadly agreed with the staffs forecast of the balance of payments. However, they noted that the current arrangement of pegging the vatu to an undisclosed basket of currencies, despite its lack of transparency, had withstood the pressures on the exchange rate during the last two years while maintaining a low and stable inflation rate. The mission replied that, while a fixed rate regime provided a useful framework for macroeconomic discipline for a small open economy such as Vanuatu’s, a more transparent peg could be beneficial. Pegging to an undisclosed basket of currencies risked triggering periodic speculation about the underlying direction of policy, undermining the credibility of the authorities’ policy declarations. Thus, the staff encouraged the authorities to consider increasing the transparency of the regime. The staff also noted that it would be difficult achieving the twin objectives of exchange rate and reserve stability in the face of a fragile balance of payments, and thus the level of the exchange rate needed to be kept under review. 19. The authorities recognized that fiscal performance in 2000 could be worse than budgeted but claimed that the budgetary impact of the shortfall in revenue and problems with foreign financing could be contained. They noted that expenditure could be contained through the system of curbing monthly expenditure warrants, thus limiting the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9 - need for excessive domestic financing. Moreover, even if the second tranche of the AsDB loan did not arrive this year, they expected the budgetary impact to be small, since relatively little of the loan was allocated for current expenditure and capital spending could be delayed. 20. The staff pointed out that, while the short-term impact of not receiving the second tranche of AsDB loan would be limited, the effects in the medium term-both on the budget and the economy-could be serious. Failure to resolve the outstanding issues surrounding the release of the second tranche could jeopardize planned projects for rural financial services and infrastructure development in the outer islands that the government might otherwise have secured from the AsDB. It could also affect financing from other donors, many of whose projects were supporting or related to the continued implementation of the CRP. The staff thus urged the authorities to resolve the outstanding issues with the AsDB. While admitting these risks, the authorities voiced concerns about accumulating more external debt without carefully reviewing the viability of the projects proposed by donors. The staff has since learned that an AsDB mission during June held fruitful discussions with the authorities about outstanding CRP issues. As a result, the second tranche could be released as early as October 2000, after a further review by the AsDB in August. B. Medium-Term Fiscal Policy 21. The authorities have made higher spending on health and education a priority over the medium term. This reflects widespread agreement on the need to improve health services and increase the skill level of the labor force, in order to raise potential growth and foster social equity. The staff strongly supported the authorities’ objectives but commented that the higher spending would impose additional burdens on the budget, requiring either expenditure restraint elsewhere or finding additional sources of revenue. 22. The staff noted that Vanuatu faced the prospect of a widening fiscal gap over the medium term. Staff estimates suggest that with unchanged tax policy, government revenue would decline by l/2 percent of GDP between 2000 and 2005, because of the low elasticity of customs duties, which account for a large share of total revenue.S In addition, planned increases in spending for health and education would raise outlays by 1 l/4 percent of GDP over the period from 2001-when development spending is expected to return to more normal levels-to 2005. The overall deficit would thus rise steadily, reaching 5% percent of GDP by the end of the projection period (Table 3). These estimates assume no need for 5 Vanuatu’s customs duties comprise eight rates ranging from 0 to 30 percent, reflecting reforms implemented under the CRP in July 1998. The average rate of duty, estimated at about 23 percent (versus 29 percent before the reform), remains high relative to other Pacific Island economies. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-10 - budgetary support for the VNPF over the medium terrn6 Staff estimates suggest that the VNPF, as a result of a recent change in its governing statute that lowers the minimum share of assets that must be invested abroad from 50 to 20 percent (Box l), could provide financing for about 1% percent of GDP a year, while foreign financing could cover another 2 percent. This would leave an unfinanced gap that could reach 2 percent of GDP by 2005. 23. The unfinanced gap in the budget would have to be filled largely by compensating changes in revenue and expenditure. Although staff projections suggest that the banking system could provide the required financing during 2000 without seriously squeezing private sector credit, over the medium term excessive bank financing would not be a growth maximizing strategy, because of the inevitable crowding out of credit to the private sector. Cuts in the wage bill, from rationalizing positions outside the health and education sectors, could cover some of the gap. However, major savings in wages could be difficult to achieve, given the large cuts in employment during 1998. Similarly, it might be hard to make large reductions in subsidies and transfers, which will remain as a share of GDP below the 1998 level, or in development spending, given Vanuatu’s sizable needs to install and upgrade infrastructure. Thus, the present, narrow revenue base would need expanding.’ The authorities could also benefit from filling vacant positions in customs administration, as noted in recent technical assistance reports, and reviewing exemptions or reductions in current taxes. 24. The authorities noted that they planned a broad review of tax policy, keeping all options open, including the possibility of an income tax. The staff strongly supported the government’s open-ended approach, noting that a broad review would allow consideration of further reductions in Vanuatu’s still high import tariffs while raising revenue and broadening the tax base. The authorities, in turn, were willing to consider such reductions in this context. C. Structural Reforms 25. Both the authorities and private sector representatives commented that the cost of doing business in Vanuatu was quite high, deterring investment. Besides shortages of skilled labor, evidence suggested that electricity and telecommunications costs are significantly above those in the region (Box 3), which may reflect the lack of regulation of the privately-owned monopolies supplying these services. Moreover, customary land rules often make it hard to secure access to land and credit. Many observers also commented that 6 The VNPF, as a defined contribution plan (Box 1), has no direct links to the budget, However, there could be calls for budgetary support, as in 1998, if its assets sustained major losses, impairing the ability to meet demands for pension payments and other withdrawals. ’ Vanuatu has no taxes on income or profits and no excise taxes on domestically produced products. In June 2000 the OECD included Vanuatu on its list of 35 tax havens that may face sanctions unless allegedly harmful practices in their tax systems are remedied. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-11 - the creation of the Vanuatu Foreign Investment Board (VFIB), which had expedited consideration of investment proposals, did not eliminate all delays, because local governments had retained the power to require that projects comply with their own regulations. In addition, the formation of the Vanuatu Indigenous Melanesian Entrepreneurs Business Association (VIMELBA), although helpful, could have only limited impact in aiding local investors because of its small size. 26. The staff strongly endorsed the authorities’ interest in establishing a regulatory authority for the private utilities. This would curb monopoly profits while preserving the efficiencies resulting from private ownership. In this regard, the staff noted that the French Development Agency’s offer to support a regulatory authority for the telecommunications company could serve as a first step toward creating a more comprehensive regulatory agency, for which the government could approach donors for financial and technical assistance. D. Financial and Banking Sector Issues 27. The authorities noted that bank supervision had improved since the creation of the initial supervisory unit in the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu in 1996. However, many private observers, including bankers, commented that supervision remained weak, despite these improvements and periodic technical assistance from a Fund-sponsored expert. The mission found that Reserve Bank staff had been unable to enforce key regulations, such as the need to make prescribed provisions against substandard loans. While the Reserve Bank was to receive two more visits over the coming year from the Fund-sponsored expert, the mission suggested that the authorities consider approaching other donors to obtain a resident advisor who could provide steady training to the supervisory team. 28. As regards the offshore center, which is supervised by the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the authorities noted the need for greater information sharing and coordination between the FSC and the Reserve Bank. The staff agreed, noting that this would also address one of the concerns in the international financial community about Vanuatu’s ability to combat money laundering. The authorities, while objecting to the decision by certain international banks to preclude dollar transactions with some institutions in Vanuatu, acknowledged areas where laws and administration could be strengthened to deal with possible money-laundering and stated that they were moving to address these issues. The staff noted that improved bank supervision and better coordination among supervisors would strengthen the ability to counter money-laundering and encouraged the authorities in their efforts to upgrade laws and administration in this area, so as to reach international standards. 29. The authorities pointed out that significant progress had been achieved in restructuring the VNPF since its financial turmoil in 1998, restoring public confidence (Box 1). They also noted that the asset allocation guidelines of the VNPF had been changed, allowing it to hold a larger share of its assets domestically, giving the government access to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-12 - significantly more nonbank financing. However, the VNPF’s earnings could be weakened if, under the new guidelines, its assets are used as a captive source of budgetary finance. IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES 30. Since 1998 Vanuatu has made significant progress in improving its government finance statistics, but problems remain in the balance of payments and national accounts. The mission commended the authorities on presenting public finance data in a manner largely consistent with Government Finance Statistics classifications. The staff noted, however, that major shortcomings still remain in the external sector, including possible data misclassifications that call into question the measurement of the current account of the balance of payments. In addition, little information is available on short-term debt.’ National accounts data are unavailable for years after 1995, and the consumer price index (CPI) is reported only quarterly, and with a lag of three months. The authorities noted that the Statistics Offrce plans to release comprehensive data on national accounts later this year but lacked the resources to produce a monthly CPI. The staff urged the authorities to seek technical assistance to overcome these problems, so that the real and external sectors can be monitored more effectively and in a timely manner. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 31. Over the past two years, Vanuatu has had to weather a number of economic challenges. Despite these difficulties the authorities managed to maintain macroeconomic stability, keeping inflation down and preventing large reserves losses. The economy appears to have recovered from its 1999 recession, and inflation will likely stay subdued, but the prospects for sustained growth over the medium term remain doubtful. The balance of payments also remains fragile, although some improvement is likely in the next two years, reflecting the completion of airport projects, boosting tourist receipts. However, the overall balance could easily return to a deficit during later years. 32. The fiscal situation remains tight this year, and a fiscal gap is likely to emerge over the medium term. Lower proceeds from asset sales are likely to reduce revenue below the budget forecast in 2000, and the delay in receiving second tranche of the CRP loan could postpone implementation of some projects. Over the medium term, under current policies, falling revenue and the desire for higher health and education spending will create a rising fiscal gap reaching 2 percent of GDP by 2005. * Most short term debt is likely to be in the form of related-party borrowing, however, since four of the five commercial banks are foreign owned and few private corporations have direct access to international capital markets.

The authorities should use their planned review of the tax system to consider ways of raising revenue by broadening the tax base while allowing a further reduction in the country’s still high levels of import duties. Savings might also come from further rationalization of government employment, although it will be important to meet the needs for additional teachers and skilled health workers. 34. The exchange rate regime also needs attention. While the pegged rate regime provides a useful policy framework, the authorities should consider making the present exchange rate regime more transparent, to increase credibility. They also need to keep the exchange rate under review given the fragility of the balance of payments situation. 35. While the CRP focuses on much needed institutional strengthening in the public sector, structural reforms will also be required to ease the economic bottlenecks facing Vanuatu. In particular, private investment has been hindered due to skill shortages and high business costs. Appropriately, the government has focussed on making education a priority. In addition, steps are needed to reduce business costs, including the creation of appropriate regulation for the privately owned, monopoly suppliers of utilities. 36. Vanuatu needs to bring its legislation and relevant institutions in combating money laundering up to international standards. Bank supervision aIso needs strengthening, and the coordination of bank supervision between the Reserve Bank and the Financial Services Commission should be improved, to give the authorities comprehensive knowledge of both the onshore and offshore financial sectors. 37. Although some progress has been achieved, weaknesses in economic statistics continue to complicate the task of conducting surveillance. The authorities should implement their plan to publish national accounts data for 1996-99 later this year. They should also reduce the three-month lag in publishing the consumer price index and consider producing a monthly index. Possible data misclassifications in the balance of payments, which make it difficult to hard to verify the current account balance, require urgent attention. On this subject the authorities may want to seek technical assistance. 38. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with the 24-month cycle.

Vanuatu: Vanuatu National Provident Fund The Vanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF) is Vanuatu’s public system for accruing retirement savings. Members contribute based on their incomes, and withdrawals are possible in the event of death, permanent medical disability, permanent emigration, or retirement at age 55. Since it is a defined contribution system, payouts are based on contributions plus accumulated earnings credited to members’ accounts. Members earn interest on their deposits based on the VNPF’s overall earnings. Until 1999 the VNPF was required to pay a minimum interest rate of 3 percent on all deposits, regardless of earnings. This provision was removed during 2000 following a review of VNPF operations. All employees in Vanuatu with monthly salaries of 3,000 vatu or higher are members and pay contributions based on their earnings. Through 1999 the contribution rate was 3 percent of earnings for employees, with a matching 3 percent levy on employers. In 2000 these rates increased to 4 percent each for employees and employers. Beginning in 2001, the percentages rise to 6 percent each. In 1999 the WWF’s net receipts totaled 398 million vatu, equivalent to 1.4 percent of GDP. In 2000, net receipts are projected at 6 17 million vatu, equivalent to 2.1 percent of GDP. At end- 1999, the VNPF’s assets totaled 1.1 billion vatu , equivalent to 4.1 percent of GDP, and are projected to reach almost 1.8 billion vatu (6.1 percent of GDP) at end-2000. Past mismanagement of VNPF assets has created considerable controversy. For many years the VNPF incurred substantial losses, reflecting investments in unproductive real assets and low returns on its financial assets. During 1998 public protests over its soundness led the Government to approve unlimited withdrawals from the VNPF. In the event, 3.3 billion of the nearly 4 billion vatu on deposit was withdrawn, prompting a sudden rise in liquidity, a jump in consumption and imports, and pressure on the exchange rate. Because of liquidity constraints, funds were withdrawn throughout the year, with the bulk of payments falling the spring (March through May) and final months (November-December). Since March 1999 the VNPF has been engaged in a major restructuring effort. The staff was pruned, a new general manager was hired, and steps have been taken to bring members’ accounts up to date. Contributions are now being monitored more carefully, an investment committee has been formed, and rates of return on financial assets have improved significantly. In addition, outstanding bad loans were transferred to the government’s Asset Management Unit, generating a net cash infusion of vatu 280 million. In 2000, after many years of deficits, the VNPF began to earn a surplus. Moreover, a recent amendment to the VNPF’s authorizing statute changed the rules governing the VNPF’s asset distribution, reducing the required share of VNPF assets placed abroad from 50 percent to 20 percent. Thus, during 2000 the VNPF’s investment committee plans to invest only 20 percent of new assets abroad, down from 50 percent in 1999. As of early 2000,74 percent of the assets were held domestically, and 26 percent were held abroad, The VNPF still faces many challenges, including the need to pay off an accumulated deficit of 380 million vatu. Consequently, the VNPF is not yet able to credit members’ accounts with earnings. However, confidence seems to have been restored. As of mid-2000, most of the VNPF’s 37,000 members were again net contributors. In addition, the VNPF is beginning to play a role in budget financing. Given its desire for relatively secure, long-term domestic assets, the VNPF has begun purchasing government securities and has expressed interest in acquiring long-term government bonds. The VNPF is thus providing a source of non-bank financing for government while creating demand for longer-term securities, broadening the market for government debt.

Vanuatu: Comprehensive Reform Program The Comprehensive Reform Program (CRP), which being implemented with help from the Asian Development Bank, was initiated in mid-July 1998. The main features of the program are the following: 1. Public sector reforms l Improve institutions of governance, including increased transparency and accountability in public sector management, l Reduce the size of the public sector and rationahze its economic operations. l Strengthen financial and economic management. 2. Economic reforms l Promote the private sector and take steps to augment its growth. l Improve monetary management of the Reserve Bank and strengthen its supervisory capabilities. l Restructure state-owned financial institutions. l Establish an NGO network to channel credit to rural areas. l Reform the tax system. l Improve infrastructure and service delivery. l Promote equity and social development. Implementation of the CRP was divided into three phases. During Phase I and Phase II, the program focused on establishing and implementing the reform framework, especially in strengthening capacity to promote stability, investor confidence and private sector led growth. Substantial progress was made in the following areas: . l . . A legislative framework has been established for better governance and further improvements in public services. The number of ministries has been cut from 34 to 9, and civil service employment has been reduced by 7 percent. Several state-owned financial enterprises, including the National Bank of Vanuatu (NBV) and the Development Bank of Vanuatu (DBV), have been restructured or closed. The VNPF Act was amended to promote financial reforms. Autonomy in the public service has been increased, and efficiency has been improved. Principles of fiscal management have been established. Indirect instruments of monetary policy, in the form of Reserve Bank bills, have been introduced. The tax system has been reformed by introducing a value-added tax, removing the business turnover tax, and simplifying and reducing import duties and business license fees. Several equity-enhancing and social projects have been implemented. Phase III started in year 2000. The government is focusing on the following goals during this phase: l Entrench and deepen the reforms already introduced. l Extend government reforms to embrace the Parliament and the legal sector. l Promote economic growth. l Strengthen the focus on social reforms to ensure that the benefits of CRP are shared and that reform is sustained. l Achieve improvements to economic conditions and to service delivery at the village level. The government has met the following conditions for securing the second tranche of the CRP loan: l The NBV has been restructured, and the DBV has been merged into it. l A master plan in the health sector has been established and is being implemented. l The Decentralization Commission has been established and is operating. However, the government still needs to fulfil1 the following four conditions: l Establish and have functioning an Expenditure Review Committee to scrutinize public expenditures. l Have Public Service Commission and Department of Strategic Management jointly develop and implement a management improvement plan for all agencies, to ensure effective implementation of key management systems in the public sector. l Enact legislation for and establish a Remuneration Tribunal to determine the level of salaries and allowances to public sector staff. l Develop a master plan for national infrastructure development, and develop and implement a similar plan for the education sector. The government is now reviewing a previously developed plan for the education sector. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- Box 3. Vanuatu: High Utility Costs High utility costs have been identified as an important factor hampering Vanuatu’s economic growth. Foreign investors have cited these costs as a serious impediment to expanding operations in the country, and some bankers have cited these among the factors requiring high interest rate spreads. Vanuatu’s high utility costs appear to reflect the lack of regulation over the country’s private suppliers of electrical, water, and telecommunications services. Although private ownership has presumably led to more efficient provision of utility services than would be likely with public provision, the monopoly status of these companies has enabled them to seek monopoly profits, thereby raising prices. A similar phenomenon can be observed elsewhere among Pacific Island economies. For example, UNELCO, the electricity provider in Vanuatu, is owned by Energie Electrique Caledonie, which operates the private electricity monopoly in New Caledonia and also charges relatively high prices. The past few years have seen some improvement in the pricing of utility services. For example, charges for international telephone calls have declined somewhat in U.S. dollar terms since 1998, even after taking into account the effective depreciation of the vatu vis-&vis the dollar. However, calls remain expensive, as do electricity charges (see figures below). Similarly, UNELCO has offered an inexpensive connection package as a promotion. However, it would reportedly raise rates during the second quarter of 2000 by 2.2 percent. The government is keen to address high utility costs and has proposed, in its Fiscal Strategy Report for 2000, to create a regulatory framework for public utilities. A possible project, supported by the French Development Agency, to create a regulatory authority for the telecommunications company could provide the frost step toward a more comprehensive regulatory authority. 5.0 , International telephone charges of Vanuatu (UWmin) I CaUto Eumpe,Japan _ .

A second credit, also equivalent to US$2.0 million, was approved in March 1986, to finance high-priority projects in the transportation and education sectors. Both operations were cotinanced with the Asian Development Bank. A primary and secondary education project, involving US$S.O million in IDA funds, and cofinanced with the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), was approved in November 1988. A housing project (US$3.4 million), aimed at increasing the supply of affordable housing to middle- and lower-income groups and strengthening key sector institutions, was approved in June 1991. A second education project is currently under development and is due to be considered by the Bank’s Board in FY2001. The Bank completed a country report on Vanuatu in March 1993, as part of the second Pacific Islands Regional Economic Report. This focused on public sector reform, the role of the private sector in achieving sustainable growth, human resource development, and environmental issues. In addition, country reports on Vanuatu have been prepared as part of the Bank’s Pacific regional studies on post-secondary education, transportation, and health. The third Regional Economic Report focusing on trade, tourism, fisheries, forestry, and regional coordination was finalized in 1995. The fourth Pacific Islands Regional Economic Report was completed in 1998, and the fifth is due to be completed in June 2000. The Bank is also working with the government on the development of an Education Master Plan for Vanuatu and in the area of regulatory reform for the utilities sector. Small business advisory services for the Pacific Island member countries are provided through the South Pacific Project Facility (SPPF), established in 1989, and managed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). SPPF is currently working on some nine projects in Vanuatu: three in tourism, three in fisheries, one in manufacturing and two in agro- processing. In January 1996, the IFC approved the first investment loan in Vanuatu, which involves the purchase of an existing hotel property from receivership, refurbishing all 150 rooms, upgrading public areas, and building an additional ten bungalows on the adjacent island.

The loan projects included assistance for agriculture, port facilities, development financing, urban infrastructure development, the Comprehensive Reform Program (CRP), and cyclone damage rehabilitation. The technical assistance projects covered both project preparatory and advisory assistance in the areas of agricultural development, forestry, industrial estate development, vocational training, agricultural support services, population planning, economic and fiscal management, and CRP support. The pipeline for 2000 consists of a project loan to support rural financial and business advisory services and, on a standby basis, a sectoral development program loan, to improve infrastructure on the outer islands and establish a policy and institutional framework for sustaining infrastructure maintenance. Technical assistance projects are programmed for supporting the CRP’s progress, preparing the Skills Development Project, capacity-building of the Vanuatu National Council of Women, capacity-building in rural financial services, and, on a standby basis, policy formulation for agriculture and fisheries sector development. The strategic thrust of the AsDB’s operations for Vanuatu over the medium term will be: (i) to maintain its support for the CRP; while (ii) facilitating the development of the productive sectors, particularly agriculture and fisheries; and (iii) supporting the provision of infrastructure and social services. There is a strong cross-cutting concern for addressing poverty, employment, and other social issues, particularly in the rural areas. Within the above strategy, AsDB intends to support the following subsidiary objectives: (i) responsible and transparent government with good governance; (ii) government capacity to deliver essential services efficiently and effectively; (iii) provision of policy framework for developing key sectors, including agriculture and fisheries; (iv) a more open and competitive economy, which would thereby encourage private investment, increase employment, and improve standards of living; (v) provision of basic infrastructure to outer islands and a framework for sustainable operations and maintenance; (vi) enhancement of access to financial services for local citizens, to create or support small businesses; and (vii) developing the vocational skills of both urban and rural residents, particularly women and youth, for broadening their employment opportunities, ’ Prepared by AsDB staff.

There are significant deficiencies in Vanuatu’s economic statistics, especially in the areas of the national accounts and the balance of payments, as noted below, which hamper economic analysis. Available economic and financial data are regularly published in the Reserve Bank’s Qunrterly Economic Review (@CR) and the Statistics Office’s quarterly Statistics Indicators (Sr). The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu is responsible for balance of payments and monetary statistics; the Finance Department produces GFS data on a monthly basis; and the Statistics Office is responsible for most other official statistics (GDP, CPI, trade, tourism, population, and income statistics). PFTAC’s Statistics Adviser recently visited the Statistical Office and the Reserve Bank and found that, while progress has been made over the past year, there will be a continuing need for training and technical assistance to strengthen their very limited statistical capacity. Real sector 2. National accounts statistics are available only for the period up to 1995. No published data are available for subsequent years. Technical assistance in this area was provided by the Fund in 1988 and by a regional UN agency in 1993. In 1997, a PFTAC technical assistance mission noted that the Statistics Office had limited capability for compiling national accounts because of insufficient staff, lack of training opportunities, and inadequate data processing equipment. The Asian Development Bank has assigned a six-month term consultant for the Statistics Office. The Statistics Office is now preparing to publish national accounts data for 1996 - 99 later this year. It also has undertaken a Census of Population and has released preliminary results. The final report is expected to be released late this year. However, there is no plan to improve the frequency and timeliness of CPI data release, due to the lack of staff. Wage and employment data are not officially compiled. Government finance 3. The latest annual data reported by the Ministry of Finance and published in the GFS Yearbook were for 1989. Due to nonreporting, the country page for Vanuatu was dropped from the 1994 GFS Yearbook. However, the quality of the government finance data has improved lately, as a result of an AusAID institutional strengthening project, which has enabled implementation of recommendations of the STA mission that visited Port Vila in November 1998. The authorities have compiled and started providing monthly fiscal data in a GFS format. Some inconsistencies remain between the fiscal and monetary data measures of the deficit, and in the accounting for aid-in-kind. Monetary data 4. The reporting of consistent monetary data for the Reserve Bank and the commercial banks to STA has improved. However, the reported data for other banking institutions are not current. The Reserve Bank has provided a breakdown of the sundry income in the monetary data for the monetary authorities, which permits STA to properly reclassify these accounts.

Balance of payments 5. The Reserve Bank provides quarterly balance of payments data. There are large outward private transfers for the Reserve Bank staff cannot fully explain. In addition, net errors and omissions are very large and variable. These suggest significant errors elsewhere in the accounts. There are also inconsistencies with government finance statistics. Technical assistance in this area is urgently needed. Coordination and cooperation between the main statistical agencies also need to be strengthened, to improve the quality of balance of payments statistics and assure internal data consistency.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Vanuatu On July 31, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Vanuatu.’ Background In the two years following the last Article IV consultation discussions Vanuatu has faced a variety of economic challenges. After a 6 percent increase in 1998, real GDP fell by 2% percent in 1999, reflecting unfavorable weather and delays in major infrastructure projects. At the same time, CPI inflation slowed to 2% percent from 3% percent a year earlier, as the one-time effects of the introduction of a VAT in 1998 wore off and economic activity remained weak. The current account balance shifted into deficit in 1999, reflecting a decline in exports of agricultural commodities and reduced tourism, which were partially offset by higher foreign direct investment in the coconut sector and a drawdown of net foreign assets by commercial banks. As a result, gross reserves fell by US$l l/2 million and stood at US$42% million by end-1999, covering 6% months of imports. The foreign exchange market has experienced intermittent pressures during the past two years: first, in mid-1998, following the withdrawals of retirement savings from the Vanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF), and then in late 1999-early 2000, after the most recent change in government. The authorities contained pressures during the first episode by raising interest rates, and engineered an effective devaluation of the vatu by changing the weights of the undisclosed basket of currencies to which it was linked. During the later ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with offkials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - ANNEX VI episode, the authorities responded by reintroducing, in February 2000, regulations restricting access to foreign exchange for capital transactions that had been removed in October 1999, to reduce the oufflow of reserves. Although the trade-weighted real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated from 1997-98 to1 999, the tourism-weighted REER appreciated strongly over this period, and both measures appreciated from end-l 999 through early 2000. Monetary conditions, which were tightened following the VNPF crisis in mid-l 998, were relaxed somewhat during the latter half of 1999 as activity weakened. Nominal interest rates, which had risen sharply in mid-1998, declined through the course of 1999 as the Reserve Bank expanded liquidity by repurchasing Reserve Bank notes, and private sector credit grew modestly. Total broad money fell 9 percent, reflecting the decline in commercial bank net foreign assets. Several changes have also been made in the framework for conducting monetary policy during the last two years. To absorb the liquidity injected by the withdrawals from the VNPF and aid the sale of government bonds, in early 1998 the authorities replaced the 10 percent statutory reserve requirement (SRR) with a 16 percent prescribed reserve asset requirement (PRA), toward which the banks could count their holdings of government bonds. Around the same time the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) began issuing its own notes. In late 1998, a repurchase facility, covering short-term government bonds and RBV notes, was introduced for more efficient liquidity management. In April 1999, the RBV introduced a 16 percent liquid asset ratio requirement for prudential purposes, abolished the PRA, and raised the SRR, which was reintroduced in late 1998, to 10 percent of average vatu deposits plus 50 percent of foreign currency demand deposits. The fiscal deficit in 1999 was smaller than budgeted, despite a decline in tax revenue, due to the economic slowdown, reflecting delays in infrastructure projects and tighter controls on current expenditure. A decline in tax revenue, equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP, was more than offset by a reduction in current expenditure and a 4% percent of GDP shortfall in spending on infrastructure projects, reflecting delays in implementation. Accordingly, the overall budget deficit fell to 1% percent of GDP in 1999 from 11 l/4 percent of GDP in 1998 and was about 4% percent of GDP less than budgeted. Activity in the offshore financial center remained weak in 1999. Much of this weakness may have followed allegations of money laundering levied against some offshore institutions, which led several major international banks to ban U.S. dollar transactions with Vanuatu. Some of these banks have since resumed US. dollar transactions with certain institutions. A mission from the Asia-Pacific Group of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) visited Vanuatu in early 2000 to assess the country’s efforts to combat money laundering, and the mission’s report is expected to be released shortly. Since 1997, the government has been engaged in implementing a wide range of economic reforms under the Comprehensive Reform Program (CRP)-with the support of the Asian Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - ANNEX VI Development Bank (AsDB) and bilateral donors-to provide much needed institutional strengthening, accountability, and transparency to the public sector. While significant progress has been achieved, much of the program remains to be completed. However, progress in implementation has slowed since mid-1999, and the release of the second tranche of the AsDB loan supporting the CRP has been delayed due to delay in implementing some of the accompanying conditionalities of the loan.
