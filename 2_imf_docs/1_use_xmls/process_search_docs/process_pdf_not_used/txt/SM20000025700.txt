Growth is estimated to reach 8 percent in 2000 versus a program target of 3 percent. Inflation reduction remains broadly on track to reach single digits by year-end. The authorities have maintained a prudent fiscal policy in the face of much stronger revenue. Expenditure has remained broadly as budgeted, with the result that the overall fiscal balance of general government in the first half of 2000 was in surplus of 1 percent of GDP versus a program deficit of 8 percent of GDP. Under the impulse of surging export earnings, the external current account turned to a surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP in 1999 (versus a program deficit target of 1.7 percent of GDP) and in the first half of 2000 the surplus has grown to around US$600 million (3.6 percent of GDP). Reflecting these developments, the National Bank of Kazakhstan repaid all outstanding obligations (SDR 296 million) to the Fund in late May. Kazakhstan today faces a very different set of policy challenges than expected under the program. In this light, policy discussions focused on the need to adjust fiscal and monetary policies to the realities of the much more favorable external environment. The importance of the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy is heightened by the large external inflows and the authorities’ decision to stabilize the nominal exchange rate as compared with the floating rate regime on which the program was based. This important policy change places an additional emphasis on fiscal consolidation and the need to develop a revised medium-term fiscal strategy to prevent a squeeze on the nonoil tradable sectors (“Dutch disease”). Discussions also focused on the need to re-energize the structural reform agenda, which has largely stalled and clarify the linkages of the petroleum sector to the budget. As promised in the staff report for the extended arrangement, the staff has sought to elucidate the linkages of the petroleum sector to the rest of the economy, which have taken on added importance with the surge in petroleum prices and the increasingly favorable prospects for the oil sector in Kazakhstan. The first review under the extended arrangement approved in December 1999, was to have been completed by end-June 2000. Staff recommendation for completion of the review would require: (i) agreement on a revised macroeconomic framework reflecting the much more favorable external environment;(ii) a recovery of the momentum of structural reform; and (iii) measures to address staff concerns on transparency, especially as relates to the budgetary aspects of oil sector operations. No purchases have been made under the arrangement, which the authorities are treating as precautionary.

The 2000 Article IV consultation discussions were conducted during missions that visited Almaty and Astana on May 1-18, July 20-27, and September 7-13,200O.’ * During the same period review discussions on the economic program supported under the extended arrangement approved in December 1999 also took place. However, discussions to complete the first review, originally envisaged by end-June 2000, have not been concluded. Staff recommendation for completion of the review would require: (i) agreement on a revised macroeconomic framework reflecting the much more favorable external environment; (ii) a recovery of the momentum of structural reform; and (iii) measures to address staff concerns on transparency, especially as relates to the budgetary aspects of oil sector operations. 2. The 1999 Article IV consultation with Kazakhstan was concluded on July 26,1999. At that time, Executive Directors welcomed the steps taken to restore conditions for sustainable growth, including the switch to a freely floating exchange rate regime, and commended the authorities for the progress made on many important aspects of structural reforms. However, Executive Directors felt that the authorities’ response to the changes in the external environment had not been sufficient and stressed the need to consolidate the fiscal position, maintain a prudent monetary policy, and pursue the transition process. Directors also expressed concern about the recent reversals of trade liberalization. Kazakhstan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement on July 16, 1996. Kazakhstan’s exchange system remains free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. 3. A three-year extended arrangement, in the amount of SDR 329.1 million (90 percent of quota), was approved by the Executive Board on December 13,1999. No purchases have been made under the arrangement, which the authorities are treating as precautionary. Indeed, on May 24,2000, reflecting a significantly strengthened external ’ The staff met with Prime Minister Tokayev, First Deputy Prime Minister Pavlov, Deputy Prime Minister Utembayev, Minister of Finance Esenbayev, Minister of State Revenue Kakimjanov, Minister of Economy Kulekeyev, Chairman of the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) Marcher&o, and other senior government and NBK officials. The mission also met with members of the diplomatic, banking, and business communities. * Staff members participating in one or both missions were Messrs. van der Mensbrugghe (head), Mathieu, Semblat, and Lehmann (all EU2), Mr. Szekely (FAD), Mr. Njoroge (PDR), Mr. Stem (PDR), Ms. Marton (interpreter- BLS), and Ms. John (assistant-EU2). Mr. Geadah (MAE) participated in the discussions on the FSSA. Mr. Prader, Alternate Executive Director, participated in policy meetings during the July mission. Mr. Ross, the resident representative, assisted the missions.

All performance criteria and indicative targets at end-March and end-June 2000 were met, most by considerable margins (Table 1). This reflects very favorable exogenous developments, as well as prudent macroeconomic policies. By contrast, only one of the seven structural benchmarks established for end-March and end-June was observed unambiguously (Table 2). Two performance criteria for end-December 1999 were missed, as was one indicative target, primarily reflecting temporary factors. The excess cash fiscal deficit was almost entirely due to the faster repayment of pension and other arrears at the end of 1999. The repayment of pension arrears was originally expected to spill over into the first quarter of 2000. The indicative target for reserve money was exceeded by a very large margin, reflecting the large NIR over-performance, but was reversed in early-2000. 5. The quality and coverage of economic statistics has continued to improve, subject to the caveat on the oil sector discussed below. This reflects the authorities’ efforts, which have been supported by technical assistance from the Fund and other agencies. Statistical issues are discussed in Appendix IV. Kazakhstan participates in the General Dissemination System (GDDS) and in this context has undertaken to improve coverage and reporting in a number of areas. However, reporting of reserves and debt data is below the benchmarks set out in the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). II. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS A. Growth and Inflation 6. Since the extended arrangement was approved, the external environment has improved considerably, with the result that Kazakhstan today faces a very different set of policy challenges than expected under the program. The large shocks in 1998/99 from the Russian and Asian crises, compounded by a delayed policy response, resulted in a sharp decline in economic activity from mid-1998 through mid-1999. The economy began to recover in the third quarter of 1999 and GDP is estimated to have risen 1.7 percent in real terms for the year as a whole (Table 3). The economic environment improved sharply in the first half of 2000 with real GDP growth estimated at 10.5 percent. The strong recovery has been supported by a recovery in regional demand and much higher world market prices for petroleum and minerals, Kazakhstan’s principal exports. Industrial output was up 16 percent in the first half. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was slightly above program target at 18 percent at end- 1999, but has declined steadily to 10.1 percent (year- over-year) at end-September-a cumulative 5.7 percent in the first nine months of 2000 (Figure 1). B. Fiscal Developments 7.

The overall cash deficit for 1999 fell to 5.3 percent of GDP from 7.8 percent in 1998.3 In the first half of 2000, the overall balance of the general government was in a surplus of T 9 billion (0.9 percent of GDP), compared to the program deficit target of T 72.1 billion (7.6 percent of GDP). The surplus was generated by local governments, as the central government accumulated a small deficit of around 0.1 percent of GDP (Tables 4a and 4b). Local governments benefited from the strong increase in revenues and kept overall expenditure restrained. General government revenue (excluding grants) amounted to T 25 1.2 billion (813.8 percent of GDP) in the first half of 2000, compared to an indicative target of T 166.6 billion (17.5 percent of GDP) (Tables 5a and 5b). Most of the revenue over- performance was due to higher than projected tax revenue (22 percent of GDP compared to 16.1 percent of GDP in the program and 15.4 percent of GDP in 1999). The revenue over- performance was concentrated in corporate income taxes (CIT) and royalties; approximately one-half was from the petroleum sector. The central and local governments have almost equally benefited from the increase in tax revenue. The strong budget revenues reflect substantially higher petroleum prices and greater production, combined with companies’ exhausting their loss carry-forwards by the beginning of the year. Also, in 2000 some T 20 billion in CIT liabilities were settled that had been accrued in 1999 versus a negligible float the year before. Despite the good overall revenue performance, collections from VAT on imported goods and excise on gasoline were considerably less than projected. 9. Notwithstanding the strong revenue performance in the first half of 2000, the central government has maintained tight expenditure control on budgetary institutions and local governments have not spent the excess revenue. Primary expenditure was slightly lower than programmed, while interest expenditure was some 20 percent less than projected due to the significantly lower financing requirements and the stronger domestic currency. The central government accumulated no pension arrears in the first half of the year. The stock of nonpension arrears of the general government, including arrears on VAT refunds stood at T 49.4 billion at the end of June, well below the performance criteria of T 63 billion, in part reflecting cash payments of T 5.3 billion, more than double the amount programmed. As a result of the delay in blue-chip privatization, privatization receipts were considerably less than projected. Foreign borrowing was considerably higher than programmed, due to the Eurobond issue in A~ril.~ Thus higher budget revenues almost fully translated into a 3 The cash deficit target of 3.3 percent of GDP was exceeded primarily on account of early repayment of pension (0.7 percent of GDP) and nonpension (0.9 percent of GDP) arrears in December 1999. The overall budget deficit, excluding the repayment of pension arrears, was 5.3 percent of GDP, compared to the program target of 4.1 percent. 4 The program assumed that the second tranche of the World Bank’s PR4L would be received in January 2000 allowing the government to repay 1999 pension arrears. In the event, the PRAL was disbursed in December 1999 and pension arrears were repaid at that time. As regards the Eurobond, the net receipt was US$339.2 million, out of which US$2 17.5 million was used in a swap operation to replace a special state bond previously issued and transferred to the private pension funds in return for T-bills.

C. Monetary and Exchange Developments 10. While the program was based on a floating exchange rate regime, the authorities have adopted a policy of stabilizing the exchange rate. Faced with large foreign exchange inflows, the NBK has intervened in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the exchange rate. Reserve money surged temporarily by 45 percent in the final quarter of 1999; this was largely reversed in early 2000, as government deposits rose sharply, and reserve money fell to well below the end-March target (Table 6). The tenge fluctuated narrowly around T I38- 143 per U.S. dollar in late-1999/early-2000 and has been virtually unchanged at about T 142.5 per U.S. dollar since mid-year. Given continued NBK intervention in the foreign exchange market, the rise in net international reserves has been much stronger than programmed in the first half (4 1 percent of end- 1999 reserve money stock vs. 3 percent programmed). Notwithstanding the discharging of its entire financial obligation to the Fund in May, gross official reserves of the NBK stood at US$2.1 billion (2.6 months of imports) at end-August, some US$l25 million more than at end- 1999. Following the spring 1999 depreciation, the real effective exchange rate (REER) declined sharply (by around 28 percent) through late-1999. In early 2000 the REER appreciated about 5 percent and has remained stable since then. These changes reflect almost entirely nominal effective appreciation relative to partner countries (Figures 3 and 4). Against the backdrop of economic recovery and improving confidence in the banking system, monetary aggregates have expanded significantly. At end-June 2000, broad money had increased by 61 percent since end-September 1999, with total deposits growing rapidly (by 76 percent), reflecting a doubling of foreign currency deposits. As a result, banking intermediation has deepened as indicated by a 16 percent increase in the money multiplier and by the rise in the broad money to GDP ratio. With signs of a recovery in tenge money demand, the NBK has loosened monetary policy in 2000; the refinance rate was lowered in two steps from 18 percent to 14 percent and the reserve requirements were reduced from 10 percent to 8 percent, although a technical change has offset the impact of the latter.5 11. Given the strong growth in deposits and shifting expectations on the exchange rate, interest rates continued to move downward during the last quarter of 1999 and the first half of 2000. Banks have been reducing their long foreign exchange positions by investing foreign exchange resources in tenge assets. The market in tenge denominated government securities has thereby revived and rates on 3-month treasury bills have declined by 7 percentage points since September 1999 to reach 9.5 percent in early August 2000, although bank loan rates have declined by less (Figure 5). ’ Cash foreign exchange holdings by banks must now be deposited in the NBK to count towards meeting the reserve requirement.

Following an external current account deficit of 5.6 percent in 1998, the external current account recorded a surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP in 1999 (Table 7).6 Imports contracted by 15 percent and exports increased on account of rising commodity prices and volume. Continued strong increases in both volume and prices of the main exports resulted in an estimated current account surplus of 2.6 percent in the first quarter of 2000. Substantial foreign direct investment inflows dominate the capital account. Net inflows for 1999 stood at US$ 1.6 billion, though these flows are almost entirely directed to the strongly expanding oil sector.’ Loan disbursements to the central government amounted to US$353 million, more than off-setting the amortization of official external debt of US$263 million. The official external debt stock stood at US$3.6 billion at end-1999, equivalent to 25.3 percent of GDP. Kazakhstan issued a seven-year Eurobond of US$350 million in April 2000, which was priced at a yield of 11.25 percent, or 500 basis points above a comparable benchmark yield. In view of the recent recovery and stabilization of the economy, Standard & Poors upgraded Kazakhstan’s credit rating on sovereign foreign currency liabilities to BB- in July 2000. 13. As regards trade policy reform, the government has eliminated trade restrictions introduced at the outset of the Russian crisis, thereby meeting the end-December 1999 and end-March 2000 structural benchmarks. It has converted all specific tariffs, bar one, into ad- valorem tariffs. However, there have been delays in the reform of the tariff regime, notably in the gradual conversion of mixed tariffs, and in the reduction in the number of tariff lines above 20 percent. 14. The authorities have increasingly resorted to ad hoc trade restrictions to address perceived problems in domestic markets. In July 2000, the government renewed and expanded safeguard import duties on a large number of inputs for the construction and extractive industries. Further, to address shortages in the domestic market for fuel, the authorities have renewed an export ban on certain kinds of fuel, and in August decreed that petroleum producers supply mandated quantities to domestic refineries. This measure in effect re-introduces export restrictions that were temporarily imposed in the form of a crude oil export quota in late- 1999. The WTO accession process is lagging. The government did 6 This figure includes an estimate for the underinvoicing of exports, and differs from the official figures reported by the authorities. Based on estimates for transport costs in the oil sector and for prices of crude oil in world markets, the upward revision of export revenues is put at $279 million for 1999 and $411 million for 2000. A negative counter-entry is made in the capital account, leaving the overall balance and errors and omissions unchanged. ’ The authorities have recently announced a very large off-shore oil find in the east Kashagan area of the Caspian Sea by the OKIOC consortium. The consortium is yet to confirm the size of the find pending further test-well results.

E. Structural Reforms 15. Notwithstanding progress in some areas, the pace of structural reform has stalled and reversals are apparent in some areas. There have been continuing delays in the privatization of blue chip companies, delays in important fiscal sector measures, and stagnation in land and social sector reform (Box 1 and Table 2). 16. A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was undertaken jointly by Fund and World Bank staff in February/March 2000 (Box 2). The assessment found that while Kazakhstan had achieved substantial progress in banking reform, the banking system remains fragile and has so far played only a relatively minor role in the economy. Risks include the emergence of an opaque enterpise and bank ownership structure, reflecting weaknesses and gaps in supervision, where large business groups with industrial and official affiliations have significant ownership stakes. Loan concentration to financially weak enterprises is also of concern, as many large profitable firms, especially in the petroleum sector, use international banks. Most parts of the financial system are at an early stage of development. III. POLICYDISCUSSIONSANDMACROECONOMICOUTLOOKFOR 2000-01 17. The policy discussions focused on the need to adjust fiscal and monetary policies to the realities of the much more favorable external environment, which has the potential to undermine the program’s inflation objective. The importance of the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy is heightened by the large external inflows and the authorities’ decision to stabilize the nominal exchange rate as compared with the floating rate regime on which the program was based. This important policy change places an additional emphasis on fiscal consolidation and the need to develop a revised medium-term fiscal strategy to prevent a squeeze on the nonoil tradable sectors (“Dutch disease”). In this light, discussions also focused on the need to re-energize the structural reform agenda and clarify the linkages of the petroleum sector to the budget. The latter has taken on added importance with the surge in petroleum prices and the increasingly favorable prospects for the oil sector in Kazakhstan.

Structural Reforms Government guarantees: a system to limit the extent of contingent liabilities on newly issued guarantees was set-up in compliance with the end-March structural benchmark. It includes a system to continuously monitor the financial position of guaranteed borrowers and a system to secure the accumulation of the funds borrowers need to service guaranteed debts. The systems cover all newly issued guarantees and at present there are two borrowers participating in the system. Excise duties: The program to improve the collections of excise duties on oil products was introduced as programmed, although its implementation was delayed. The effort was further compromised in July with the temporary suspension of the excise duty on imported oil products in the context of a shortage of products during the harvest season. Tax code: Work on a revision of the tax code, a key program benchmark for June, has broadened beyond earlier expectations. The government opted for a major revision of the tax code including new amendments carrying detailed instructions concerning procedures and the rights of tax payers. The government has closely consulted with the business community and has received extensive assistance from FAD and LEG. The government discussed the draft in late September and submitted it to parliament in early October. Civil service reform: A series of decrees have been issued implementing the rules and regulations under the new civil service law. Extension of the program to tax police and customs and to local governments is still pending. Customs reform: Progress with formulating a specific and detailed program of action to reform customs administration has been limited. Social protection: Discussions with the World Bank on a Social Protection Adjustment Loan and on a Social Protection Implementation Loan were delayed. Broad agreement has been reached on the social assistance policy for SPRAL but the policy matrix has not yet been fmalized. Consequently, the end-June structural benchmark requiring the presentation of legislative amendments designed to ensure full execution of the social assistance program by local governments was not met. Privatization: No large-scale firms have been privatized, compared to the program target of four enterprises by end-March and ten enterprises by end-2000. Regulatory and judicial reform: Efforts are underway to effect a significant reduction in the excessive and overlapping licensing requirements, to ensure greater transparency and accountability. A Justice Ministry review of 6000 state enterprises to identify and remove the remaining regulatory functions, both at the republican and local levels, has been completed and 284 entities that have regulatory functions have been identified. The new labor law was approved in late-l999 and came into effect in 2000. Judicial review of the bankruptcy, leasing, and collateral laws has been completed. Only the new leasing law has been approved by parliament (on July $2000). Land ownership rights: The new land law was re-submitted to parliament in mid-March and published for public discussion; however, parliament put off f%rther consideration until mid-October 2000. Financial system: In March, parliament adopted amendments to the legislation on banking secrecy enhancing confidentiality rights for households and limiting the powers of the tax authorities. In January, the NBK introduced a limited deposit insurance for household term deposits. In the first half of the year, the banking system continued its consolidation and restructuring as the number of banks operating in Kazakhstan declined by 7 to 48 and the government sold 16.7 percent of Halyk Savings Bank leaving it with a 50 percent stake plus one share. The implementation of two key measures agreed under the program to strengthen the supervision capacity ofthe NBK have been delayed, the NBK has only limited powers to conduct consolidated supervision and to assess risks associated with connected lending. AAer some delays, the amendments to the Law on Banks and Banking requiring banks to submit consolidated financial statements were sent to parliament. Amendments to the Law on Banks and Banking to prevent courts from overturning NBK decisions revoking licenses, which was a structural benchmark for end-March, was rejected by the justice officials on the grounds that it would require amendments to the constitution. An alternative is being sought. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- Box 2. Financial Sector Stability Assessment The main findings are the following: Substantial progress toward strengthening, diversification, and consolidation of the banking system was achieved. However, the size of the banking system remains limited and its contribution to the economy is still small. Profitability of the banking system appears good as banks were able to offset the deterioration of the quality of the loan portfolio subsequent to the April 1999 depreciation of the tenge by realizing foreign currency revaluation gains. Banks report strong capital positions, but the adequacy of loan loss provisions is a concern. High interest margins reflect inefficiencies from structural and institutional weaknesses. The most profitable companies from the oil, gas and metallurgy sector do not rely on the banking system for financing and therefore banks often deal with high risk customers. With the insurance industry still undeveloped, the pension funds are the only other main financial institutions. Following the reform of the pension system in 1998, pension funds have grown rapidly and are managing assets amounting to almost 4 percent of GDP. The overall legislative framework for oversight of the financial sector is satisfactory, but the supervisor has not been provided with enough flexibility and discretion. There is a lack of experience of judges on financial cases and independence of the judiciary appears limited. Despite some important progress, banking supervision complies with few of the Base1 Committee Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. The NBK can improve its compliance of a number of principles by consolidated supervision and by limiting’the possibility by courts to overturn NBK decisions on revoking banking licenses.

With Kazakhstan facing a very favorable external situation, the achievement of macroeconomic stability requires continued fiscal consolidation. Owing partly to high world market prices for oil and other commodities, the staff projection for real GDP growth for 2000 has been revised upward to 8 percent.8 The external current account is projected to record a surplus of 3.9 percent of GDP and gross reserves are expected to reach US$2.1 billion by the end-2000. In order to achieve the inflation objective of 9 percent, within the context of the authorities’ nominal exchange rate stabilization objective, the staff believes that an overall fiscal balance is required (compared to the program deficit target of 6 percent of GDP). Following the first half surplus, which in part reflected restrained expenditure, the tightened annual target is consistent with a small deficit of T 12 billion (1 percent of GDP, annualized) in the second half, and assumes sustained strong tax receipts. Monetary policy will need to refocus on countering the effects of drawdowns in government deposits (excluding the proceeds of the TengizChevroil sale) and enhance coordination with the budget. B. Fiscal Policy 19. The discussions focused on the extent of the projected revenue strength and the appropriate fiscal policy response in light of the revised macroeconomic outlook for 2000. In view of the changed objective to stabilize the nominal exchange rate, the authorities agreed that fiscal policy would have to bear much of the burden to prevent inflation from accelerating, given the very strong balance of payments position. Although revenue (excluding privatization) was much greater than originally programmed and budgeted, the authorities were initially reluctant to revise the 2000 fiscal targets. With the passage of time, as it became evident that economic growth and commodity prices would both be considerably stronger than originally programmed, the authorities agreed to revise the fiscal outlook for 2000. 20. The staff estimates that the 2000 general government budget will be in approximate balance (-0.1 percent of GDP) compared with the program budget deficit target of 6.0 percent of GDP. The central government is projected to run a small deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP while the local governments will run a surplus of a similar magnitude. Compared with the original program target of 19.0 percent of GDP, total general government revenue is projected to amount to 24.1 percent of GDP.’ The authorities expressed broad 8 The Ministry of Finance has retained a projection of 5 percent, born out of a concern to project revenue conservatively. ’ The revenue over performance in part reflects receipt of US$210 million (1.3 percent of GDP) of an oil bonus payment in conjunction with the sale by Kazakhstan to Chevron of a 5 percent stake in the Tengiz petroleum joint venture for US$450 million (2.8 percent of GDP). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- agreement with the revised revenue projection but were somewhat less optimistic (22.6 percent of GDP) than the mission.” While pleased with the overall outturn, the mission expressed concern that revenue, outside the petroleum sector and other natural resource sectors, was less than programmed. In particular, on account of the suspension of excises on petroleum products and the continued weaknesses in customs administration, revenue from excises, customs, and VAT on imported goods is projected to be 0.5 percent of GDP less than programmed. 21. Despite the large revenue over-performance, the authorities intend to execute the original budgeted level of expenditure. In submitting a revised 2000 budget to parliament, the government is requesting an increase in spending of T 8 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) to cover an unexpected increase in social benefits and to clear a portion of domestic arrears. This additional expenditure will however be fully offset by savings on interest expenditure and by lower net lending. On a consolidated basis, local governments have accumulated a large surplus and thus have contributed to the large build-up of general government deposits at the central bank. A rapid decline in such deposits later in the year would complicate the task of monetary policy. Overall, the mission commended the authorities for the cautious stance on fiscal policy. The significant progress made this year in fiscal consolidation (Figure 6) was instrumental in reducing inflationary pressures and paves the way for sustained economic growth. 22. In view of the growing importance of the petroleum sector in the Kazakhstani economy (see Box 3 below), and as promised by staff at the time the EFF was approved,” the staff has sought to obtain a better understanding of the determination of budget revenue from the petroleum sector. Since 1998, oil production has increased by nearly one-third and oil prices in the international market have more than doubled (annual average). Given the high cost of transportation for exporting crude from Kazakhstan, the average break-even price for oil is estimated at about US$l3 per barrel. Fiscal revenue from the petroleum sector in 1998 was thus negligible. In 1999, recorded oil receipts in the budget amounted to T 17 billion (0.9 percent of GDP). This year, as losses carried-forward from earlier years were eliminated and prices and volume increased sharply, oil budgetary revenues are projected at T 184 billion (7.8 . percent of GDP) of which the staff estimates that royalty obligations not recorded in the budget may amount to T 39 billion (1.7 percent of GDP). The authorities argued that this estimate is too high, but they felt constrained by their laws on lo Using the staffs projection of GDP, i.e., a growth rate of 8 percent rather than 5 percent, the authorities’ revenue to GDP ratio would be 23.3 percent. However, as noted below in paragraph 22, the staff estimates that a proportion of oil royalties is not included in the authorities’ budget estimates. Hence the differences in revenue estimates between staff and authorities are more pronounced than shown (some 2% percentage points of GDP). *I EBS/99/214 (1 l/29/99), page 10.

But given the lack of conclusive information to the contrary, the staff continues to believe that its own estimates are reasonable. 23. Discussions also took place on the 2001 central government budget, which the government submitted to parliament on September 15,200O. The central government budget is based on a general government total tax revenue projection of T 484 billion (18.6 percent of GDP) and assumes an international oil price of US$27 per barrel. By contrast, assuming the current WE0 price of US$28 per barrel, the staff pointed out that its estimates were US$970 million (5.3 percent of GDP) higher compared with the authorities’ general government tax revenue projections. The staffs sensitivity analysis indicates that every US$l change in the price of oil per barrel results in a change in total budget revenue of about US$80 million (0.4 percent of GDP) per annum. In its discussions, the staff fully concurred with the authorities on the desirability of cautiously projecting revenue, especially given the volatility of oil prices, in order to ensure the full execution of expenditure and to avoid the need for recourse to exceptional financing. However, to enhance the budgetary process, the staff recommended transparency in the methodology of estimating oil revenues. The authorities agreed that they would seek to obtain additional information in order to refine the budget estimates of oil revenue. The staff is continuing its discussions with the authorities to improve the basis of estimating oil revenues. The staff indicated that the failure to have a comprehensive understanding of the determination of budgetary oil revenue and its accounting on the expenditure side undermined the budgetary process and cast doubt on the appropriateness of fiscal policy and overall macroeconomic policy. 24. The authorities affirmed their intention to maintain a cautious fiscal policy. Based on conservative revenue projections and continued restraint on aggregate expenditure, the government’s proposed budget provides for a deficit of T 95 billion (3.6 percent of GDP).” l2 The authorities cited two laws on confidentiality: “On Protecting and Supporting Private Enterprise,” which notes that the makeup and volume of information comprising a commercial secret will be determined by the affected parties themselves; and “On Taxes and Other Mandatory Payments to the Budget,” which restricts the list of entities to which information received by tax service agencies may be presented. I3 The staff made its own estimate of oil revenues, based on publicly available information. I4 The first reason was that the staff estimate was based on an underestimation of the deductions that were allowed in calculating tax payments due, especially transportation and operating costs and VAT refunds. The second was that the staff had used too high an oil price in their estimates. ” Local governments have not yet formulated their budgets, but assuming a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP at the local government level, and using the staffs revenue projection, the 2001 central government budget submitted to parliament implies a general government overall deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2001. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - The staffs revenue projections suggest that if the government remains committed to the expenditure level set out in the draft 2001 budget, the overall central government deficit will be 1.7 percent of GDP.16 Noninterest current government spending is budgeted to increase by 12.6 percent in nominal terms, or a real increase of about 5 percent. In view of the recent security-related incidents in Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, defense spending is budgeted to nearly double; for the past several years, defense spending has been recorded at about I. 1 percent of GDP. The increase in military expenditure is in large part attributable to a sizable increase in wages of military personnel, which have not been increased for several years. The mission expressed some concern about an increase in the wage bill of some 25 percent which may cause inflationary pressure. The authorities noted that a fair amount of the wage increase would result in higher social tax payments.” The mission also expressed concern that the budget provides for an external debt guarantee of some US$300 million in contrast to this year’s budget of US$SO million and the authorities’ commitments under the program. In view of major doubts on the economic viability of the project to rehabilitate the Atyrau oil refinery, an assessment made by World Bank staff, based on data provided to them, the mission cautioned the authorities on their intention of extending the loan guarantee. In addition, the mission also called the authorities’ attention to the fiscal burden such guarantees generate, which last year amounted to 7.5 percent of total central government revenue (the 2001 budget has had to allocate some 6 percent of total revenue to this use). The mission however commended the authorities for closely monitoring enterprises which obtain government guarantees and for requiring such enterprises to provision for future debt service. 25. The staff held discussions on the key policy principles of operation of a national oil fund, which the authorities are planning to establish. A draft law on the creation of the fund is under preparation. A special account has been opened at the central bank. It is expected that the US$660 million from the sale of its 5 percent stake in TengizChevroil will occur shortly and be deposited in the central bank. It is intended that the fund’* will provide a buffer for the government to insulate budget operations from large swings in the oil price and to save a part of the oil revenue for future generations. In its discussions, the staff has recommended that the fund provide for transparent public oversight of the resources, with I6 This assumes an average international price of US$28 per barrel and does not incorporate all royalty payments as the staff lacks information on these sums and how they may be utilized. ” The 10 percent pension contribution of government employees (to private pension funds), is deducted fi-om the gross wage and paid directly by the budget, even though according to the law the contribution is to be paid by the employee. In order to comply with the law, public sector wages will be grossed up, but this measure will be expenditure neutral, as the pension contribution on wages was included in the budget. Therefore, the 25 percent increase in nominal wages is equivalent to a 13 percent increase in pre-tax earnings. ‘* A presidential decree in July 2000 set out the basic objectives of the fund and established the special committee charged with drafting the law.

The staff also recommended that the fund be part of the budget and be cast in the context of a comprehensive fiscal strategy. The authorities agreed with the importance of transparency for the operations of the fund. 26. In line with the program commitment, a presidential decree in June 2000 abolished the Astana special economic zone. However, as part of the amendment to the budget system law submitted to parliament, the government plans to reintroduce a special revenue sharing arrangement for Astana, assigning 50 percent of the VAT collected in its territory to the local government. The 2001 budget submitted to parliament is based on this amendment and assumes that the special revenue sharing arrangement for Astana is maintained. Given that VAT is collected where the headquarters of the company is located, and that the headquarters of national companies are now all in Astana, this means that Astana will continue to receive more than 10 percent of total VAT revenue collected nationally. More generally, the authorities will need to address the complex issue of fiscal federalism as there is an uneven distribution of revenue and expenditures at the local government level. C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 27. Discussions centered on the appropriate stance of monetary policy in the context of expected large foreign inflows. While the National Bank has a clear objective of achieving single-digit inflation in 2000, the targeting of nominal exchange rate stability may compromise the reserve money management objective of hitting the inflation target. This tension will become particularly difficult to manage, should, as expected, the government draw significantly on its balances at the NBK, in the latter part of 2000. An increasing premium will therefore be placed on the close coordination of monetary and fiscal policies and may also require the NBK to use more forcefully and more frequently its sterilization instruments. 28. Following the pronounced depreciation of the tenge in April 1999, the authorities felt that the exchange rate had reached a level which no longer required official intervention. Indeed, because of the considerably strengthened external position, the authorities expressed concern that the foreign exchange market was facing pressure for the rate to appreciate and that a more appreciated rate would adversely impact the nonoil tradable goods sector, especially for those firms competing with Russian producers. Largely for this reason, the authorities expressed a preference to keep the exchange rate relatively stable. In addition, the monetary authorities noted that due to the pick-up in economic activity and increased confidence in the banking system, there has been a sharp increase in the demand for money. The staff agreed that there had indeed been an increase in money demand but urged caution in significantly increasing the program’s monetary targets. In order to maintain a relatively stable exchange rate, and still achieve the single-digit inflation objective, the staff noted that fiscal policy would have to be much tighter than originally programmed in view of the expected strong foreign exchange inflows in the economy. Moreover, the staff noted, that as pressures from the balance of payments were unlikely to abate in the short-run and that general government was unlikely to run a surplus in the second half of the year, the extent of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - sterilization required by the NBK could prove costly and ultimately would not be effective. The staff recommended that under these circumstances, it would be preferable to allow for a nominal appreciation rather than to ignite inflationary pressures which would result in a real appreciation. The monetary authorities agreed that should foreign inflows overwhelm its ability to maintain its reserve money position and thus its inflation objective, the NBK would allow the exchange rate to appreciate. 29. The monetary program for the second half of 2000 assumes a further decline in velocity and a concomitant increase in broad money by around 20 percent from end-June. As noted above, a reversal of the dollarization experienced in 1998-99, has emerged in mid- 2000, which if confirmed would support the inflation reduction strategy. In this context, reserve money growth would increase around 9 percent from end-June level. The staff believes that a modest real appreciation of the exchange rate (4 percent in effective terms in July year-over-year) can be expected to continue, against the background of continued strong export earnings. The authorities share the staff view that this likely real appreciation should occur through a nominal appreciation rather than through higher inflation. D. Banking Sector 30. The authorities are determined to move ahead on implementing much delayed measures for increasing the capacity of the NBK to conduct its role as a supervisor. First, the amendments on the Law on Banks and Banking requiring banks to submit consolidated financial statements to the NBK has been submitted to parliament. The amendments, however, have shortcomings and the NBK addressed these by submitting a second set of amendments to the banking laws to parliament in September 2000. Second, the staff urged the NBK to renew efforts and work closely with justice officials to identify alternative ways to amend the legislation on the power of the courts to overturn NBK’s decision on revoking banking licenses. The NBK is also seeking to address institutional and operational shortcomings of the deposit insurance fund identified by the FSAP report, notably on potential conflicts of interest that could arise from having banks represented on the fund board and overly restrictive procedures for payouts. It is also working to extend deposit insurance coverage beyond household term deposits starting in 200 1. E. Structural Policies 31. As noted above, progress on the structural reform agenda has been disappointing, especially in the area of large company (blue chip) privatization, including Kazakhtelecom, where a privatization strategy supported by the EBRD has been stalled for some time. The authorities acknowledged that progress in this area has been much less than expected and indicated that they had installed a new team in the Privatization Committee, which had been commissioned to prepare a new Privatization Action Program for 2001-02. The staff also expressed its concern that progress in establishing clear land rights in agriculture, has been frustrated by repeated delays and division in parliament. While publication of the revised draft law for public discussion is welcome, it is apparent that passage of an appropriately strong, market oriented law will require strong political Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - leadership. The staff noted the encouraging developments in the electricity sector, where reforms have advanced steadily-notably through privatization, demonopolization, and the adoption of regulations creating a wholesale market-have produced a more reliable supply and reduced costs. The staff encouraged the authorities to persevere to completion with the reforms of the sector. By contrast, the domestic petroleum products market requires urgent reform. The high level of concentration, elevated state participation, low investment, and poor technical and financial performance has led to unreliable supply, volatile prices, and pressures for government administrative intervention. The staff urged the authorities to prepare a market-based action program to liberalize, demonopolize, and privatize production and marketing/distribution. 32. On licensing, the authorities are making initial progress in examining this issue given the need to clarify, streamline, and make more accountable many aspects of state activity in this area. Surveys of small and medium enterprises (SME) activity point to excessive, overlapping, and arbitrary regulatory interference at all state levels. The staff noted, and the authorities agreed, that the SME sector is the most dynamic and employment-intensive sector and its unfettered growth can have a major impact on poverty alleviation and unemployment. 33. As regards structural reforms in the fiscal sector, the staff strongly encouraged the authorities to lift the temporary suspension of excise duties on imported petroleum products and to implement the program, given its long-term importance for the broadening and the sustainability of fiscal receipts. The authorities agreed in principle with the need to implement this program, but explained that the suspension of excise duties had been needed to stabilize petroleum product prices at a time of sharp upward pressure in prices and when supplies were needed for the harvest and the heating season. The staff also urged the authorities to press ahead with the key reform of the customs administration, given the importance of this measure in raising revenue and broadening the tax base. The authorities indicated that work was continuing on this reform. The staff noted the delay in revising the tax code, but also considered that the broadened objective noted above and the need to ensure careful drafting would place the quality factor ahead of speed. The new tax code is unlikely to become effective until January 1,2002. Regarding the treasury modemization project, the mission emphasized the importance of including the payroll module, pointing out that the exclusion of this function greatly hinders the effectiveness of budget formulation and execution and makes the central government budget more prone to misallocation of resources. 34. As regards trade policy, the staff expressed its concern on the slippages in liberalization and lack of progress on WTO accession. The staff also indicated strong reservations regarding the recent reversals in the form of export bans and quotas, and temporary import duties. Further, these ad hoc actions were aimed to address domestic market problems, which appeared at their root to have structural causes. This was particularly true of the domestic oil products market. The authorities explained that delays in trade liberalization resulted from procedures linked to their participation in the customs union with Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - Russia and three other CIS members. They further responded that they had imposed temporary anti-dumping duties fully consistent with WTO standards. While acknowledging that the domestic petroleum market was not operating effectively, the authorities stressed that the emergency nature of the problems justified exceptional measures. F. External Sector Policies and Prospects 35. The outlook for the external accounts in 2000 and 2001 continues to be favorable; current account surpluses are projected at 3.9 and 3.8 percent, respectively (Table 8). An increase in petroleum production of 17 percent to about 34 million tons is expected in 2000, of which about 27 million tons would be exported’(Box 3). Given continued strong volume increases and a slight price decline in 200 1, export revenues from oil and gas should rise sharply to about US$4.9 billion, more than double the earnings in 1999. All other export commodities are also projected to grow strongly, in both price and volume terms. This unusually strong export growth should be accompanied by commensurate increases in imports of goods and services and income repatriations. Following the contraction in imports in the years 1998 and 1999, strong income growth and buoyant foreign direct investment this year are expected to result in imports growth of about 15 percent this year and about 10 percent next year. 36. Loans from bilateral and multilateral official creditors are still a significant source of external financing; disbursements are projected at US$261 million in 2000, and at US$378 million in 2001. Still, a slackening of the momentum of structural reform may impede official financing, and the prospects for a social protection adjustment loan by the World Bank (US$200 million) are unclear. Foreign direct investment constitutes the largest item in the capital account, though large inflows mask the relative decline of foreign investment in sectors other than the oil and gas industry. Moreover, prospects for continued inflows on a scale seen in recent years may be put at risk by the government’s intervention in the export trade, and increasing regulatory uncertainty facing foreign investors. Following the government’s Eurobond issue in April 2000, the state oil company and several commercial banks are preparing to launch private bond issues in international markets. Coverage in the reported balance of payments data is also likely to benefit from improvements in the recording capacity at the NBK. While reported figures include estimates for imports by personal shoppers (the so-called “shuttle trade”), errors and omission are still significant and amounted to US$446 million in the first quarter of 2000 alone.” Moreover, the medium term projections also assume that the authorities’ efforts to curtail the underinvoicing of exports will bear fruit, and that reported figures will gradually come closer to actual export revenues based on world market prices. However, coverage is still inadequate due to the definition of residency under Kazakhstani law, according to which most branches of foreign corporations are not subject to balance of payments reporting requirements. I8 The NBK was recently given responsibility for conducting a quarterly survey on services trade and, based on first quarter results, construction services contracted by foreign oil companies are likely to feature more prominently in future.

Prospects for Petroleum Production and Exports In the two years since 1998, Kazakhstan has witnessed a 3 1 percent volume increase in the production of crude oil and condensate. Export revenues from oil are projected at US$4.3 billion in 2000, a sharp increase from the US$l.7 billion recorded in 1998. With the recovery of the oil price, several oil producers in Kazakhstan have expanded production and brought forward capital expenditures. Tengiz Chevroil, operating the largest field in Central Asia with recoverable oil in the range of 6 to 9 billion barrels, expanded production to 260 thousand barrels per day in mid-2000. The goal is to reach 700 thousand barrels per day by 2010. The operators of Karachaganak, an oil and gas field in the northwest of the country with 2.4 billion barrels of estimated reserves, have decided to more than double investment over the next three years, largely to expand export transport capacity. Long term prospects were further brightened in July with the announcement that the Offshore Kazakhstan International Operating Company (OKIOC) had discovered very large deposits at the East Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea, though the exact size of the deposit has not yet been confirmed. Commercial production in this field is not due to start before 2005. Exports have been moderated somewhat by recent mandatory supply quotas to domestic refineries. More importantly, exports volumes are still constrained by the capacity of the existing pipeline system. Transport costs from Kazakhstan are well above the industry average and range from about US$2.70 per barrel through the Russian pipeline system to US$S-7 per barrel for the overland railroad transport. For this reason the coming into operation of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) at a cost of US$2.5 billion in 2001, will bring long-awaited extra capacity and lower transportation costs to around US$4SO/bbl. The lower transport costs will increase tax liabilities. The Kazakhstani quota in this international project is set at about 22 million tons initially and to 67 million tons ultimately. Given the large increase in potential reserves in the Caspian region, additional pipeline routes may prove economically feasible, and the authorities have recently indicated their interest in the proposed Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline project.

While some progress has been made in areas such as civil service reforms and on the budget, there unfortunately remain important areas in which further progress is needed. In addition to the crucial need for greater transparency in the budgetary aspects of the petroleum sector, the staff underlined the importance of progress on several reforms targeted in the program, relating notably to extending civil service reforms to the regions and to customs and tax police, licensing and deregulation, customs, judicial, and banking supervision. The staff also supports efforts to identify and quantify, the extent of corruption in the public sector, inter alia, through user surveys of corruption. A survey is under preparation, supported by the World Bank, which will help quantify the problem and prioritize the areas of reform. The “Governance and Service Delivery Diagnostic” survey is expected to be undertaken in late-2000 with results and recommendations available by mid- 2001. IV. THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK 38. Under the impulse of the petroleum sector expansion, GDP growth is expected to average almost 6 percent over the medium-term. The baseline scenario projects external current account surpluses of between 0.2 percent and 2.0 percent of GDP in the years 2002- 04; large increases in oil production in 2005 will result in substantial surpluses thereafter.” The baseline scenario further assumes that volume growth of nonoil exports will continue at about 5 percent per annum in the years 2002-05. The overall fiscal deficit in 2002-04 is projected to average 1 percent of GDP and to be in balance in 2005, under the effects of rising oil revenues (Tables 8 and 9 and Figures 7 and 8). The primary balance is projected to fluctuate around zero with public sector debt declining steadily. Under these assumptions, general government would build-up deposits at the NBK, including any in an offshore oil fund, of around US$l.5 billion in the period 2001-05. 39. Despite this strong export growth, the impact on the current account will be moderated by income accruing to foreign direct investment enterprises. With 80 percent of Kazakh exports directly dependent on international energy and mineral markets, Kazakhstan will remain highly vulnerable to adverse economic shocks, However, the oil price is the defining parameter in Kazakhstan’s external account, and the two alternative scenarios which are presented here explore the implications of variations in this price. A. Low Price Scenario 40. A first alternative assumption is that the oil price falls to an average of US$18 per barrel in 2001, and from then on declines, in line with the WE0 percentage change profile to I9 The WE0 oil price projections of September 2000 envisage a gradual decline of world crude oil prices to $25/bbl. by 2005.

FDI inflows would be substantially below previously assumed levels, and decline to half their present level by 2005; production increases would be considerably smaller. A depressed world oil market would also be associated with weakness in other commodity prices, and the nonoil export price index is assumed to decline by between 2 percent and 4 percent annually. A GDP growth path between -% percent and 1 ‘/z percent per annum has been estimated, reflecting lower economic activity and investment. Based on these assumptions, Kazakhstan would record external current account deficits averaging 1.2 percent of GDP. The overall fiscal deficit would jump to an average of near 5 percent of GDP and net public sector external debt (gross official external debt and guarantees less net international reserves and accumulated oil fund assets) would rise steadily to almost 14 percent of GDP, a level above that seen in 1999. Given the assumptions for reserve accumulation, this scenario would result in a financing need averaging US$800 million per year. These projections sharply underscore Kazakhstan’s high and rising vulnerability to external shocks. B. High Price Scenario 41. A high price scenario assumes continued strength in oil prices at US$33/bbl. for 200 1, and the WE0 percentage-change profile thereafter. Economic growth would remain at 8 percent in 2001 and range between 5% percent and 8 percent thereafter. Under the influence of higher oil receipts, fiscal revenues would rise sharply, allowing for real expenditure growth of around 7 percent per annum. The overall fiscal balance would turn to increasing surpluses averaging 1 percent of GDP in 2001-02 to 4 percent by 2005. General government deposits at the NBK would increase by a cumulative US$3.5 billion over the period, including those deposited in an oil fund. The external current account surpluses would reach 6 percent of GDP in 2001, fall to around 2% percent in 2002-03 and rise thereafter. Under this scenario, Kazakhstan’s net external public debt would be eliminated by 2002. 42. While both scenarios are highly sensitive to the parameter values, the assumptions lie within a reasonable range and both scenarios would require fundamental macroeconomic adjustment, continued structural reform, and sound fiscal policy. The scenarios are a stark reminder of the risks Kazakhstan faces by virtue of its rising dependence on a single volatile export commodity. Under the low price scenario, which has a historic precedent, external debt would rise over the medium-term-a clear reminder of the importance of persisting with structural reform and fiscal consolidation. Recent oil price spikes may be short-lived and should not be a reason for complacency. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 43. In marked contrast to the situation in 1998 and early 1999, the external environment has changed dramatically in Kazakhstan’s favor over the past year. The economies of neighboring countries have strengthened considerably and commodity prices, particularly oil, have risen sharply. The favorable changes in exogenous factors, combined with the pursuit of prudent fiscal and monetary policy, have led to very positive Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - macroeconomic results in 2000. Economic growth is considerably more pronounced, inflation subdued, and the overall balance of payments is in surplus. Indeed, the marked turnaround in the economic situation helps explain why Kazakhstan discharged all of its outstanding financial obligations to the Fund in May 2000, some five months after a new EFF was approved by the Executive Board. 44. To achieve sustained economic growth and macroeconomic stability, the authorities are now confronted with a significantly different economic situation compared to when the Fund-supported program was approved. In particular, economic policies need to be formulated so as to avoid the downside of natural resources,asy sources of wealth available with little productive effort that encourage rent-seeking and are consumed in the present-rather than invested to foster broad-based economic development and higher incomes in the future. The potential adverse effects should be mitigated by economic policies designed to avoid excessive exchange rate appreciation, promote saving, open trade, improve governance, and strengthen supply side stimulus through structural policies. 45. In part to minimize the impact of volatility in oil prices on the nonoil tradable sectors, the authorities have abandoned the floating exchange rate, on which the program was based, in favor of a relatively stable exchange rate regime. ln view of prevailing market forces towards a nominal appreciation of the exchange rate, greater coordination of fiscal and monetary policy is required to prevent domestic inflationary pressures from accelerating and to avoid a pronounced real appreciation of the exchange rate. While sterilization may be successful in the short run, ultimately fiscal policy must bear the brunt of adjustment in order to maintain low inflation and keep the exchange rate fixed despite strong foreign exchange inflows. The staff commends the authorities for pursuing very prudent fiscal policies so far this year but is concerned about insufficient coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, especially in view of the changing fiscal stance envisaged later in the year. Furthermore, in the event that foreign exchange inflows prove overwhelming, the staff urges the authorities to allow for some appreciation in the exchange rate, an outcome preferable to a resurgence in inflation. As noted above, a combination of economic policies will be required to prevent a significant loss of competitiveness in the nonoil tradable goods sectors. 46. Faced with much greater revenue than originally programmed, the staff commends the authorities for keeping expenditure restrained, and thus effectively sterilizing the large foreign exchange inflows into the economy. The large windfall in revenue from the oil sector, however, appears to have led to reduced efforts in collecting some other taxes. In view of the importance of widening the tax base to minimize volatility in overall revenue, the staff urges the authorities to reinstate the excises on imported oil products, strengthen efforts to collect VAT on imports, proceed with customs reform, and clamp-down on the problem of export under-invoicing which has resulted in large tax evasion. While welcoming the abolishment of the special economic zone for Astana, the staff regrets, largely on equity and efficiency considerations, that a special revenue sharing arrangement will be reintroduced. More generally, the staff would urge the authorities to analyze the complex issue of fiscal federalism to address inequities across regions. In support Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33 - of the authorities’ macroeconomic objective, including keeping the exchange rate relatively fixed, the government’s overall expenditure policy in 2000 and the commitment to maintain a cautious approach in 200 1 is appropriate. The staff would however urge the authorities to improve the targeting of social expenditure. 47. The lack of transparency of the oil sector’s operations and its linkages with public tinance and the economy undermines the budgetary process, sound macroeconomic analysis, and public accountability. To improve policy making and to identify the policy challenges and options facing the authorities, the staff urges the authorities to remedy this situation, especially through a full accounting of oil royalty payments and a clear statement regarding the management and uses of these large resources. The staff supports the authorities’ strategy to project budgetary revenue conservatively, but only on the basis of a well specified methodology which incorporates all key economic parameters. As part of the medium-term fiscal strategy, the staff supports the authorities’ goal of fiscal consolidation as one of the conditions to bring about sustained economic growth. The staff would also urge the authorities to utilize part of the excess revenue to retire government debt, which in certain cases would also have the added advantage of facilitating privatization. The staff supports the establishment of an oil fund provided that it remains a transparent part of the budget, is cast in a medium-term fiscal framework, is subject to public accountability, and invested professionally abroad. The goals of such an oil stabilization fund would be to insulate the budget from volatility in oil revenues, provide savings for future generations, prevent wasteful increases in government spending, and limit the impact of Dutch disease. It is important that the oil fund not be used to facilitate external borrowing, including issuing external guarantees. In this regard, the staff would urge the authorities to reconsider the limit on guarantees in the 2001 budget. 48. By subordinating reserve money management to the objective of stabilizing the exchange rate, the authorities have complicated the task of achieving single-digit inflation. With continued strong pressure stemming from the balance of payments, the staff has recommended that the central bank avoid a further loosening of monetary policy through another lowering of either interest rates or the reserve requirement. The staff welcomes the monetary authorities’ commitment to allow the exchange rate to appreciate should the money targets risk being exceeded, in order to safeguard the inflation objective. 49. Continuing reforms of the banking and financial system remain important. As an important step towards strengthening the banking system, the staff supports central bank efforts to require banks to submit consolidated financial statements and urges it to ensure that the supervisor has the information to gain a full understanding of the group’s financial position. The staff also recommends that the authorities amend legislation or take equivalent steps to assure that the NBK has full authority to revoke a bank’s license. In addition, the staff urges the authorities to address the shortcomings on the institutional and operational procedures of the deposit insurance fund. 50. The structural reform agenda has stalled and in several important areas there have been reversals. In view of the very large unfinished agenda, the staff urges the authorities not Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - to become complacent because of the favorable prevailing economic climate. A major impetus is required in the privatization program of large-scale enterprises, including the “blue-chip companies. The recent trade policy measures, i.e., increasing import tariffs and re- imposing de facto export quotas on petroleum products are disconcerting and harmful to economic efficiency, sustained long-term growth, and the investment climate. Such policies also facilitate rent-seeking behavior. The staff thus urges the authorities to have all sectors of the economy, both importable and exportable goods, face international competition and if necessary, provide for specific subsidies through the budget in order to minimize distortions. The failure to bring to the fore appropriate legislation on land reform is also worrying. More generally, the staff recommends that the authorities take the necessary steps to strengthen property rights and enforcement by, inter alia, judicial reform. Greater transparency, including requiring audits of enterprises according to international accounting standards, and improved mechanisms of accountability, would help improve governance and reduce corruption. 51. The staff welcomes the recent efforts by the authorities to improve basic macroeconomic statistics. Inadequate coverage of the oil sector and its operations hamper the quality of aggregate statistics and the effectiveness of surveillance. The staff urges the authorities to continue their progress in ameliorating the national accounts, particularly GDP by expenditure categories, and to improve the compilation and coverage in the balance of payments. 52. The staff stands ready to continue to assist and advise the authorities on their macroeconomic and structural reform program. Enhanced coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, greater transparency in the linkages of the oil sector with the rest of the economy, and a strengthened structural policies would be key components of a program that the staff would recommend merits the support of the Fund. 53.

VIII. IX. X. Exchange rate arrangements: The currency of Kazakhstan is the tenge, which was introduced in November 1993. The official exchange rate is determined on the basis of interbank foreign exchange auctions that are now held daily. Auctions are held for U.S. dollars and deutsche marks, and official rates are quoted for over thirty other currencies on the basis of cross-rates. The foreign exchange rate moved from T 4.68 per U.S. dollar in late- November 1993 to T 88.3 at end-March 1999. On April 4, 1999 the tenge was allowed to float freely but in practice has been kept relatively stable since the latter part of 1999. On September 30,2000, the rate was T 142.65 per U.S. dollar. Nearly 2,000 exchange bureaus have been established throughout Kazakhstan; the rates at these bureaus are very close to the auction rate, and the spread between buying and selling rates is very small.

Technical Assistance: Kazakhstan has received considerable technical assistance and training by the Fund in virtually every area of economic policy, including through about seventy-five technical assistance missions provided during 1993-2000 by FAD, MAE, STA, LEG, and the IMF Institute. In addition to short-term missions, the Fund has provided resident advisors to the National Bank, to the State Committee for Statistics (Goskomstat), and to the Ministry of Finance. Other international agencies and governments, including the World Bank, EU TACIS, EBRD, UNDP, OECD, also are providing a wide variety of technical assistance. The authorities have been receptive to the technical assistance that has been provided, however, some of the recommendations have been implemented at a slow pace, partly owing to inadequate training of staff and high turnover.

Kazakhstan became a member of the Bank and IDA in July 1992 and of the IFC in September 1993. The Bank’s lending program is designed to support the government’s efforts in the transition to a market economy through balance of payments support for macroeconomic stabilization; structural reforms through enterprise restructuring, financial sector reforms and privatization; protection of vulnerable groups through an effective social safety net; and sectoral reforms, with operations in energy, agriculture, infrastructure, and environment and through institution building and reinforcement of implementation capacity. To date, the Bank has approved US$ 1,8 19 million for 2 1 projects in Kazakhstan. These include five adjustment operations, three technical assistance loans and thirteen investment loans. Four adjustment operations and two projects have closed, with the other 15 projects remaining active. About US$l, 165 million has been disbursed. 2. During the fiscal years 1999 and 2000 the Bank approved five operations. They include: (i) a Road Transport Restructuring loan for US$lOO million; (ii) a Health Restructuring loan for US$42.5 million; (iii) a Legal reform loan for US$16.5 million; (iv) a Water Supply and Sanitation loan for the city of Atyrau for US$16.5 million; and (v) an Electricity Transmission Rehabilitation loan for US$140 million. 3. The World Bank’s Board of Directors approved in August 1997 a Country Assistance Strategy, which had been jointly prepared by the Bank and IFC. This CAS proposed a shift in Bank lending from adjustment and technical assistance loans to project lending, with an emphasis on private sector development, social protection, and social service delivery. In addition, a range of nonlending services where the World Bank has a comparative advantage would be provided. The Bank has begun discussion with the government on a new CAS, which is due to be submitted to the Board for approval in early 200 1. 4. The Bank has provided Kazakhstan with policy advice in the agriculture, financial and energy sectors, and is helping with taxation, mining and legal reform and training. A Public Expenditure Review was recently completed, and a study on the sources for non- extractive growth is underway. In addition, activities financed by the Institutional Development Fund are or will be providing training and technical support for procurement, tourism, agricultural seed marketing and gender issues. The Bank is actively coordinating with international efforts to reverse the severe environmental degradation of many areas of the country and is supporting implementation of projects approved in the National Environmental Action Plan. 5. IFC has approved thirteen operations, totaling US$236 million. Eight of these are in the financial sector, three in general manufacturing, one in agribusiness, three in oil and gas, and three in the Reach Program. About US$89 million have been disbursed.

Since the start of its operations in Kazakhstan, the EBRD has focused its assistance on the financial sector and sovereign infrastructure operations. In addition, the EBRD has been involved in the restructuring of Ispat Karmet, the biggest steel producer in Kazakhstan. As of 31 July, 2000, the EBRD has a portfolio of 10 signed projects for a total value of Euro 5 19 million (US$453 million) and it has so far disbursed Euro 349 million (US$305 million) on 7 projects. In addition, the Bank mobilized complementary financing of Euro 633 million (US$553 million) of co-financing. 2. The experience of the Bank in Kazakhstan has been satisfactory. The overall portfolio quality is good and all loans have been performing. The influence of the Bank on the transition process has been positive. A US$450 million financing from the EBRD and the IFC helped in the restructuring of operations of the major steel producer Ispat Karmet. In infrastructure, the Bank has contributed to the renovation and modemization of the Caspian Sea port of Aktau, Kazakhstan’s main shipping gateway through a US$54 million loan and is involved in several projects in the power sector, including renovation of the national grid (KEGOC) under a joint Euro 286 million loan with the World Bank. A project involving pre- privatization investment in the national telecoms operator KTC has been signed but is currently on hold. A lending program for Small- and Medium-Size Enterprises (SME) is developing rapidly and is now operational in 11 regions throughout the country. 3. Key priorities for the Bank in 2001 and 2002 involve building upon the success in key areas while extending its expertise to other sectors. The Bank will further develop the small business lending program, will deepen its participation and analytical support in the Foreign Investor’s Council established at the Bank’s initiative, and will keep on lending to the modemization of infrastructure by devoting more resources to municipal borrowers. The Bank is also considering moving into new areas such as the oil and gas sector by supporting the transformation of SOEs, in the mining and minerals sector by developing pilot projects with a view to push for changes in the tax and regulatory environments, and in the nonbank financial sector where the regulatory framework is still in development.

In the area of national accounts. despite some progress achieved in moving to the compilation of annual and quarterly GDP, several weaknesses in data compilation persist in both the quality of GDP estimates by sectoral branches produced by the National Statistical Agency (NSA) and the quality and timeliness of the production of GDP estimates by expenditures. First, the quality of annual GDP estimates by industry is affected by the poor coverage of production and financial statistics, particularly concerning small enterprises and informal activities. Second, substantial improvements are needed in the area of annual GDP estimates by expenditure categories as there are significant discrepancies between GDP estimates by industries and GDP estimates by expenditures. In collaboration with the Fund, the NSA is working on reducing the discrepancy by relying on the compilation of supply and use tables. 2. Data on prices conform to international standards. The consumer price index is calculated on a basket comprising 275 goods using a weighing system based on an annually revised Household Budget Survey. The index covers 19 regions (oblasts) and is calculated on a monthly basis. In addition, a provisional index is compiled weekly, based on a smaller basket of consumer goods. The producer price index is based on the Laspeyres formula. However, the quality of the underlying price information received from enterprises needs improvement. Also, the weights need to be updated to account for shifts in the structure of production. 3. The coverage and quality of data on wages and employment is improving. In addition to agriculture, industry, and services, collective farms and joint ventures have been included to the survey used for the wage data. Two sets of unemployment data are provided by the Ministry of Labor: the monthly data on unemployment covers only those who are officially unemployed and receive benefits; in addition, the Ministry of Labor is collecting data on hidden unemployment, comprising workers on compulsory leave or on enforced part-time status. 4. Most real sector data are published in a monthly statistical bulletin issued by the NSA, which is made available to other government authorities. 5. As a result of extensive technical assistance, the quality of fiscal data has improved, in particular on the consolidation of most extrabudgetary funds into the fiscal accounts and on the provision of more detailed expenditure data on a quarterly basis. However, the coverage of oil revenues, particularly royalties, is not transparent and may be underrepresented to a significant degree. Progress also has been made in the establishment of a classification of the fiscal accounts consistent with the Fund’s government finance statistics (GFS) methodology. However, as a result of the reorganization of the public sector, including the re-definition of budgetary units, difficulties have arisen with regard to the recording of expenditure arrears. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-43 - APPENDIX IV 6. Quality and timeliness of money and banking statistics is satisfactory and in broad conformity with the Fund’s methodology. While the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) and all commercial banks have completed the switch to new charts of accounts since early 1998, several steps are being taken by the NBK to improve the quality and coverage of data. In particular, the chart of accounts for commercial banks is being revised to enable the NBK to distinguish sectors and financial instruments in accordance with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The authorities have started drafting legislation that will permit the recording of activities of branches of foreign corporations in Kazakhstan in accordance with the IMF’s fifth edition of the Balance ofPayments Manual (BPMS). The NBK intends to implement the chart of accounts of commercial banks after it has been approved by the Board, extend institutional coverage to include the credit institutions, use uniform reporting by all other depository corporations, and develop reporting forms for the other financial corporations subsector. 7. In the area of balance of payments, while overall quality and timeliness of data is satisfactory, three major deficiencies remain which are being addressed by the authorities in collaboration with the Fund. First, trade data have substantial coverage and valuation problems and underreporting of import and export data may be significant. Second, the timeliness of international trade statistics could be improved as due to insufficient computerization of the Customs Administration, data are processed when customs forms are received rather than when goods clear customs. Finally, data on foreign direct investment may be underestimated as contrary to the standards set in the Fifth Balance of Payments Manual (BPMS), branches and representation offices of foreign corporations in Kazakhstan are neither registered as legal entities, nor as residents and therefore are not subject to balance of payments reporting requirements. 8. Kazakhstan is publishing statistical data in International Financial Statistics (IFS) since September 1996. Balance of payments data were published for the first time in the March 1998 issue of IFS. Monetary data through July 2000 were published in the October 2000 issue of IFS.

Macroeconomic developments have turned out to be much more favorable in late 1999 and in the first half of 2000 than was projected for the extended arrangement that was approved in December 1999. This performance is due to a strong recovery in regional demand, a substantial improvement in the terms of trade, and prudent macroeconomic policies pursued by the Kazakh authorities. 2. Growth is estimated to reach 8 percent in 2000, compared to a program projection of 3 percent and the inflation rate has been reduced to 10.1 percent (year-over-year) at end- September. The government has pursued prudent fiscal policies in the face of stronger than expected fiscal revenues; in the first half of 2000 the fiscal balance of the general government recorded a surplus of 1 percent of GDP compared to a projected deficit of 9 percent. Exports have grown strongly, resulting in a current account surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP in 1999 and of 3.6 percent of GDP in the first half of 2000. Reflecting these developments, the seven-year Eurobond of US$350 million issued by Kazakhstan in April 2000 was priced to yield 11.25 percent, about 500 basis points above a comparable benchmark yield. On May 24,200O the NBK repaid all outstanding obligations SDR 296 million (approximately US$385 million) to the Fund, reducing the public external debt stock at the end of June to USS3.9 billion, or 23 percent of GDP. 3. Faced with large foreign exchange inflows, the NBK has sought to stabilize the nominal tenge rate. The tenge fluctuated narrowly around T 138-143 per U.S. dollar in late- 1999 and early 2000 and has been unchanged at about T 142.5 per U.S. dollar since the middle of this year. International reserves have risen strongly and gross official reserves reached US$2.2 billion (2.7 months of imports) at end-September. 4. Against the background of economic recovery and a strong balance of payments, monetary aggregates have expanded significantly. With signs of a recovery in demand for tenge, the NBK has loosened monetary policy in 2000. Given the strong growth in deposits and the confidence of market participants in a stable exchange rate, interest rates have declined. Rates on 3-month treasury bills have declined by about 7 percentage points in the year ending September 2000 to reach around 9.1 percent. 5. Kazakhstan’s progress on structural reform has been mixed. There have been delays in the privatization of blue chip companies, in the adoption of important fiscal sector measures, and stagnation in land and social sector reform. As regards trade policy reform, the government has eliminated trade restrictions introduced at the outset of the Russian crisis and has converted most specific tariffs into ad valorem tariffs. However, there have been delays in the reform of the tariff regime and some ad hoc trade restrictions have been introduced to address perceived problems in domestic markets. 6. The quality and coverage of economic statistics has continued to improve but some significant shortcomings persist, particularly as regards the coverage of the fiscal statistics.
