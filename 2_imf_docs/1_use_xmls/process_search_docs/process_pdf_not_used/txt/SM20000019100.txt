INTRODUCTIONANDBACKGROUND 1. Maldives’ small island economy is heavily dependent on tourism and, to a lesser extent, fisheries. The country has prospered with the rapid expansion of tourism built on its unique island environment (Box 1). The modemization and commercialization of the fishing industry has been another source of growth and employment. The central role of tourism and fisheries in Maldives’ economic development underscores the imperative of protecting the fragile marine environment of the atolls.’ Over the past two decades, GDP growth has averaged almost 10 percent per annum (although somewhat slower during the 1990s than the 198Os), real per capita income has risen fourfold, and there has been a substantial improvement in the country’s social indicators (Annex IV). Maldives’ economic development has also been supported by generous external financial assistance.2 2. Recent economic performance has generally been favorable, although there have been signs of policy slippage. Growth continued to be strong and inflation remained moderate in 1999, but there was a significant budget deficit overrun and the current account balance deteriorated markedly. At the conclusion of the 1999 Article IV Consultation on October 27, 1999, the Executive Board agreed with the thrust of staff appraisal of the staff report (Z&4/99/261), which warned against emerging imbalances and urged fiscal action to restore macroeconomic stability. 3. Maldives is highly vulnerable to external shocks in view of its openness and narrow resource base. Indeed, in the early 199Os, the combination of the Gulf War and the recession in Europe (both severely hurting the tourist trade), higher oil prices, and weak world prices for tuna created serious macroeconomic imbalances. The authorities reacted swiftly through policy tightening and by the mid- 1990s the budget and external current account deficits had declined to levels that could be financed by concessional loans and direct investment from abroad. 4. This success notwithstanding, there are still significant weaknesses in the policy framework and economic structure, leaving the economy vulnerable to external shocks. These include a weak fiscal position arising from a narrow revenue base and ineffective expenditure control; monetary management that relies on bank-by-bank credit ceilings, a high reserve requirement, and interest rate controls in the context of a fixed exchange rate r In a broader sense, Maldives is threatened, over the next decades, by the ultimate environmental catastrophe of becoming submerged if the sea level rises by only a few meters as a result of global warming. 2The country’s access to foreign grants and concessional loans is becoming more limited with increased prosperity. Although Maldives’ GDP per capita is above the IDA limit, for the time being, it has been granted a “small island economy” exception by IDA.

Maldives: The Tourism Sector The tourist sector is central to the Maldivian economy and has been its main engine of growth over the last two decades. The development of the tourist sector began in the early 1970s through a private sector initiative. Apart from a brief pause in the early 199Os, occasioned by the Gulf War, the sector has enjoyed strong growth over the past decade and continues to be dominated by the private sector. The number of tourist arrivals doubled to 400 thousand during 1990-99, as the bed-capacity of Maldivian resorts also doubled to 15,000 in this period. The latest expansion phase of the sector consisted of 14 new resorts built during 1997-1999 under the government’s Tourism Master Plan, with the addition of 3,500 beds causing a temporary drop in the capacity utilization rate to around 70 percent year-round. However, no significant additions to capacity are foreseen in the near future. Ultimately, environmental considerations are likely to constrain resort expansion. In 1999, tourism directly accounted for more than 17 percent of GDP, which is an underestimation of thesector’s contribution to the economy. Tourism drives activity in other sectors, such as construction, distribution and transportation which together account for about 30 percent of GDP. The foreign currency receipts of the sector accounted for almost 80 percent of the country’s exports of goods and services. Tourism directly accounted for about a third of government revenue through a fixed tax and rents from resort leases, but also contributed indirectly through the payment of customs duties on the resorts’ large imports. It is estimated that the tourist sector accounts for about a fifth of total employment in Maldives, or around 20 thousand jobs, with foreign labor accounting for a substantial share of skilled labor. The ready availability of skilled, low wage labor from the region (Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh) has contributed to the maintenance of the competitiveness of the tourist sector in the face of an appreciating real exchange rate in the recent period. The near complete dollarization of tourism in Maldives has also shielded the sector. system; and a large state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector that dominates commercial activity in a number of areas (with the notable exception of tourism). . II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS A. Recent Developments and Prospects for 2000 5. Macroeconomic developments in 1999 were mixed: GDP growth was strong and inflation low, but the current account deficit widened sharply. With the recent strong capacity expansion in tourism (bed capacity increased nearly 10 percent), as well as some increase in the fish catch, real GDP grew by 8% percent in 1999-slightly below the average of the two previous years (Chart 1 and Table 1). CPI inflation was moderate (3 percent at Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public10.0 Real GDP Growth (Annual percentage change) 10.0 9.0 9.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 25 20 15 10 5 0 -5 - 5 - Chart 1 Maldives Economic and External Developments 1993-1999 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 Contributions to GDP Growth (Percentage points) q Terti 7 sector q Secon ary sector n Primary sector 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 Inflation (Annual percentage change) \, Consumer \ prices GDP deflator 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 25 20 15 10 5 0 -5 -__ -__ External Trade External Trade 0 0 0 0 320 320 . .

On the other hand, despite buoyant tourist receipts, the external current account deficit doubled to 15 percent of GDP, primarily reflecting a surge in imports (almost 15 percent in U.S. dollar terms) associated with an overrun in budgetary expenditures and rising private investment in tourism (Table 2). Higher oil prices and weak international tuna prices also contributed to the deterioration in the trade balance. The current account deficit was financed through significant private capital inflows (both debt and equity) to the tourist sector, as well as through a draw-down of the net foreign assets of the commercial banks. 6. The budgetary position deteriorated sharply in 1999. Despite higher-than- anticipated receipts (equivalent to about 1% percent of GDP), mainly from import duties and SOE profit transfers, the fiscal deficit (including foreign grants) widened to 4% percent of GDP, from 2% percent in 1998 (Chart 2 and Table 3). Total expenditure and net lending increased by 15 percent (compared to the budgeted 10 percent), with spending on public order and internal security accounting for most of the overrun. A considerable part of the increase in capital spending under this item reflected purchases of vessels and infrastructure development associated with the expansion of tourism in the outer islands and the policing of the country’s vast exclusive economic zone. This multi-year expansion program was largely completed in 1999 and spending on internal security is expected to decline markedly in 2000. The higher expenditure in 1999 also reflected the unbudgeted 35 percent public sector wage increase granted in September-the full impact will, however, be felt in 2000. 7. The 1999 fiscal deficit was largely monetized as foreign financing (mostly concessional loans) declined due to delays in project implementation. In fact, this marked the first time since 1994 that the government had made significant recourse to the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) for deficit financing. Even with a sharp deceleration in private sector credit growth (notably to commerce, owing in part to forceful loan recovery), overall domestic credit growth held up reasonably well (Table 4).3 The decline in the commercial banks’ net foreign assets-an important component of the financing of the current account deficit-also moderated the growth of broad money. 8. The operating performance of commercial banks has on the whole remained favorable. The rate of return on assets has hovered in the 5-7 percent range, reflecting the fixed spread of 7 percentage points between lending and deposit rates. For the banking system as a whole, non-performing loans constituted slightly more than 4 percent of total loans in 1999, down from almost 9 percent in 1997; as a result, loan loss provisions rose to ’ 70 percent of nonperforming loans. Risk-weighted capital ratios, registering an average of more than 30 percent in 1999, were well above the statutory minimum of 8 percent. 3 There is a considerable discrepancy between the fiscal and monetary accounts as regards the domestic financing of the 1999 budget deficit; see Box 2.

Maldives: Reconciliation of the Fiscal and Monetary Accounts An important characteristic of the Maldivian fiscal system is that almost all the domestic financing during the course of the year is provided for automatically by the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) via advances from an overdraft facility called the Ways and Means Account (WMA). The absence of other means of financing should give rise to a simple and clear relationship between the fiscal and monetary accounts as regards domestic financing of the budget deficit in any given year. However, the two sets of accounts have shown discrepancies in recent years, and a particularly large one in 1999, amounting to almost 180 millions rufiyaa, or close to 4 percent of GDP. The most significant factor behind these discrepancies reflects the standing practice of financing part of the current year’s fiscal deficit through arrears which are cleared in the first quarter of the following year. For 1999, this accounts for about four-fifths (145 million rufiyaa) of the difference between domestic financing recorded in the fiscal and monetary accounts, respectively. The remaining discrepancy mainly reflects differences in coverage between the two sets of accounts that could be resolved through better coordination among the fiscal and monetary authorities. Furthermore, in 1999, as in previous years, the commercial banks maintained a positive net foreign currency asset position in excess of 20 percent of capital4 9. As for 2000, the staff’s assessment is that the fiscal deficit will likely be around 4 percent of GDP-well above the budget target of 1% percent-and largely monetized. Even this outcome hinges crucially on the expected drop in spending on internal security, large advance loan and dividend payments to the budget by public enterprises, containment of costs associated with the closure of Air Maldives, and a number of revenue measures yet to be fully implemented (e.g., custom duty harmonization, expatiate visa permits). In view of this, GDP growth is expected to moderate slightly to the range of 7’S8 percent; inflation to remain in the range of 2-3 percent; and the current account deficit to narrow slightly, to about 13 percent of GDP, in response to slower import growth reflecting consolidation in the l tourism sector. 4 In recent years, the MMA has, with assistance from the AsDB, taken a number of steps to bring banking supervision into line with international standards. Considerable progress has been made in upgrading legal and regulatory provisions, but monitoring and inspection need to be strengthened further.

Maldives’ growth prospects are generally favorable, but there are also significant risks considering the economy’s external vulnerability. Given the on-going consolidation of the tourist industry, GDP growth is expected to stabilize in a lower range of 6-7 percent. An illustrative medium-term scenario (through 2004) prepared by the staff suggests that, based on the current policy stance, the fiscal deficit would widen gradually, reaching 7 percent of GDP by 2004, and would be increasingly monetized as the availability of foreign concessional financing becomes more limited (Table 5). Consistent with this outcome, and in view of the consolidation in the tourist sector, the current account deficit would settle around 10 percent of GDP which, even assuming relatively strong private capital inflows,5 would virtually exhaust Maldives’ usable external reserves by the end of the period.6 These trends are clearly unsustainable and, if unchecked, would have adverse implications for price and exchange rate stability, and for external indebtedness. The scenario is highly sensitive to external developments: any serious setback in tourism or fisheries, or a significant rise in oil prices, would worsen the macroeconomic balances even more. III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 11. The recent deterioration in Maldives’ external current account and the risks highlighted by the staff’s illustrative scenario provided the basis for the discussions. The staff argued that a comprehensive, medium-term program of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms was required, beginning in 2000, to reverse these adverse trends and reduce the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks. A. Fiscal Policy 12. Fiscal consolidation holds the key to reducing the macroeconomic imbalances. The staff team argued that, in principle, the fiscal deficit in any given year should be no larger than could be comfortably financed by concessional loans from abroad, which had been declining in recent years and were set to decline further as Maldives prepared to graduate from the group of least developed counties. The team recognized that, given the magnitude of the projected budget deficit in 2000, it would be difficult to achieve this objective fully in the current year (which would be consistent with a deficit of less than 1 percent of GDP), but every effort should be made to contain the deficit below 3 percent of . 5 Private capital inflows -mainly loans to and direct investment in the tourism sector-are assumed to average US$25 million per year, or just under two-thirds of the level during the peak years of 1997-99. 60nly about one-half of official reserves are usable as the other half represents the foreign currency deposits of the commercial banks placed at the MMA in order to meet their reserve requirements.

With government expenditure exceeding 50 percent of GDP, the fiscal effort in the current year as well as over the medium term should clearly stress expenditure restraint.8 The staff team emphasized the need to curtail unproductive spending, and cut and rationalize administrative expenditures, while protecting spending in social areas. It would also be useful to establish a multi-year, rolling Public Sector Investment Program, to better privatize government investment; low priority projects should be pruned or terminated. It was imperative to restore expenditure discipline in budget implementation and strictly observe spending limits. 14. The authorities shared the team’s analysis and recommendations. They were particularly cognizant of the need to safeguard education and health care spending in light of prospective demographic developments and clearly recognized that these developments could call for a re-ordering of spending priorities. They noted that government employment had increased by close to 45 percent since 1995, which, besides the rise in the wage bill, had led to substantial increases in most other administrative expenditures of the government (utilities, travel, etc). Civil service reform, therefore, needed to be an integral part of the medium-term fiscal strategy, which the authorities were beginning to consider. 15. The staff observed that revenue efforts should first and foremost be geared to deepening and diversifying the tax base. There was also some scope for raising additional revenue from tourism and customs. The team suggested raising the tourism tax and making it ad valorem in order to reduce its regressive nature.’ As regards customs receipts, a myriad of customs duty exemptions, mostly viewed as investment incentives, entailed a revenue loss 7For example, a 10 percent across-the-board cut in current expenditures excluding wages, pensions, subsidies, and interest would generate a saving of about 2 percent of GDP on an annual basis. ‘The high level of government spending in relation to GDP is likely to be partly the result of a considerable underestimation of the level of GDP. With technical assistance from the AsDB, work is in progress to revise the national income accounts. ‘The tourism tax has been fixed at US$6 per person per night since 1988, with inflation substantially eroding its real value. Staff calculations indicate that restoring the tourism tax to its 1988 value in real terms (increasing it by about 45 percent) would raise 2X-3 percent of GDP in additional revenue. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- equivalent to 5-6 percent of GDP.” The team argued that many of these exemptions (for example, those on capital goods) did not appear justified and their removal was not likely to materially affect investment decisions, especially in the highly profitable tourism sector. Moreover, the staff team .observed that there was sizable revenue potential in introducing a minimum uniform tariff duty-with exemptions provided only for basic staples-in the context of a medium-term program to simplify the tariff structure and narrow the dispersion of tariff rates.’ ’ Cigarette taxes could also be increased further on health grounds, and there also seemed to be scope for increasing taxes on alcohol. As additional steps to strengthen the revenue system over the longer haul, the team encouraged the authorities to implement, as early as possible, the draft laws on property rental value tax and business profit tax. Over the medium term, the government was also well advised to consider replacing customs duties with a more broadly based goods and services tax. 16. The authorities broadly agreed with the team’s recommendation to broaden the tax base. Their main concern related to the limited administrative capacity of the relatively new Inland Revenue Department to effectively implement a more sophisticated tax system, such as an ad valorem tourism tax and a corporate income tax. They were, nevertheless, determined to move ahead and preparations were already under way to draft a number of new tax laws (for example, for rental income and business profits). The authorities were of the view that the direct and indirect tax burden on the tourism sector was already high, and felt that the tourism industry would react strongly against a heavier tax burden. B. Monetary Policy 17. The staff maintained that conducting an independent monetary policy depended on effective fiscal control. The team recommended replacing the system of current automatic financing through the MMA’s Ways and Means Account (WMA) with strict access limits.‘* The authorities were well aware of the adverse impact extensive deficit monetization was likely to have, and were interested in exploring other means of deficit financing. In this connection, the team encouraged the authorities to begin preparing the ground for issuing treasury bills-an earlier MAE technical assistance mission had already made specific recommendations in this area. The team emphasized, however, that new means “A new export-import law was enacted in late May. While there were a number of welcome ’ changes in the law, there was no simplification of the tariff structure or removal of exemptions (Box 3). “Staff calculations indicate that the imposition of a uniform 5 percent minimum tariff (with an exemption only for staple food) could raise 1 s-2 percent of GDP in additional revenue. ‘*To make the access limits binding, procedures would need to be worked out for triggering spending cuts in case the WMA access limits were about to be breached. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- of deficit financing were not a substitute for deficit reduction, and they could have substantial negative effects, such as crowding out of the private sector. Box 3. Maldives: The New Export-Import Law The new law, in effect from end-May 2000, replaced the old tariff classification regime with the Harmonized System of tariff nomenclature, and catalogued imports in line with standard international classification. The new law also made several changes to tariff rates. The new tariff structure has 9 tariff bands, ranging from 0 percent for staple food to 100 percent for cars and 200 percent for plastic bags, with an estimated average nominal duty rate of about 20 percent. Most notably in terms of revenue was the change of the tariff on cigarettes from an ad valorem rate of 50 percent to a specific rate of 30 laari (100 laari = 1 rufiyaa) per stick, or 6 rufiyaa per package. In addition, the tariff rate on electrical and electronic equipment was reduced from 20 percent to 5 percent. Exemptions from customs duties are granted extensively to promote investment in the tourism and other sectors. Imports of capital goods and raw materials are fully or partially exempted if they are used for economically important projects. It is estimated that these exemptions entail a revenue loss of some 30 percent. Taking into account both tariff and non-tariff barriers (including SOE import monopolies for staple products), Maldives’ ranking on the Fund’s ten point index of overall trade restrictiveness is 7. It should be noted, however, that the protective element of tariffs is very limited given the non-existence of domestic production in most areas. Also, access to import licenses for goods, other than staples, is automatic and nondiscriminatory. 18. The staff team observed that, besides automatic monetization, a number of other factors complicated monetary management. These included multiple objectives, such as interest rate controls and a fixed exchange rate, the dominance of foreign currency in banking operations and high reserve requirements. The team noted that controls on rufiyaa interest . rates (20 percent ceiling on lending rates and maximum spread of 7 percentage points between lending and deposit rates; in contrast, interest rates on foreign currency deposits and loans were fully liberalized in 1995) were seriously distorting the deposit and loan markets. This hybrid system, dominated on the foreign currency side by the Male branch of the State Bank of India and on the rufiyaa side by the Bank of Maldives, had created the perverse situation where dollar interest rates were higher than rufiyaa interest rates. This had contributed to the dollarization of the economy and put downward pressure on the rufiyaa exchange rate. Moreover, real interest rates had remained high despite the banks’ large excess reserves. The staff team encouraged the authorities to liberalize rufiyaa interest rates, arguing that the cost of credit and the ability to price risk should be the key criterion for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13- rationing rufiyaa credit, as was already the case for U.S. dollar-based lending. As first steps in this direction, the team recommended the abolishment of the bank-by-bank credit ceilings and the removal of the 7 percentage points maximum spread between the rufiyaa lending and deposit rates.r3 With the removal of the interest rate spread, the banks should be encouraged to set a minimum lending rate to serve as the benchmark for pricing credit risk. The team also suggested that a gradual lowering of reserve requirements (currently 35 percent), as conditions permitted, and higher remuneration, would help lower the rufiyaa interest rate structure. I4 The liquidity released could be absorbed through issuance of additional MMA certificates of deposits (CDs).” 19. The authorities recognized that weaknesses in the monetary framework had constrained effective liquidity control. However, they expressed concern about the impact on the cost of credit of the relaxation of long standing controls on credit and interest rates. The team suggested maintaining the 20 percent ceiling on lending rates-which had never been binding-could be maintained initially as a precaution, although lending rates were unlikely to rise to any significant extent in view of the banks’ strong liquidity positions. The authorities’ approach was to move cautiously in adopting a system of monetary management based on indirect instruments in light of the limited implementation capacity of the MMA and the absence of money and capital markets in Maldives. C. Exchange Rate Policy 20. The staff team maintained that the fixed exchange rate had, over the years, provided an important anchor for macroeconomic policies and been a major source of certainty and confidence. Moreover, the peg to the U.S. dollar seemed appropriate, considering the degree of dollarization of the economy, and of tourist trade in particular.‘6 13Bank-by bank credit ceilings had been largely ineffective and no new ceilings had been set since the first half of 1999. “The first 15 percentage points of the reserve requirement are unremunerated while the other 20 percentage points earn 2.5 percent per annum. “So far, MMA CDs had been issued on tap and at the discretion of the commercial banks. The team suggested that liquidity mop-up operations through CDs be conducted at the discretion of the MMA on the basis of its assessment of liquidity conditions in the market. ’ The CD rate should also reflect market conditions; currently a lower rate seemed justified. “?he structure of Maldives’ external trade, with its main export chiefly marketed in Europe and most imports coming from the region, suggests that pegging to Euro or a basket of currencies could be more appropriate. However, the current weakness of the Euro vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar and the absence of physical transactions in Euro-currency do not favor a switch to a Euro peg for the time being. Pegging to a currency basket would not be as transparent as pegging to a single, major currency such as the U.S. dollar or the Euro.

The team agreed with the authorities that tourism was not particularly sensitive to the rufiyaa exchange rate and the sector’s competitiveness was supported by Maldives’ liberal expatriate employment policy that ensured low and flexible real wages. The growth of the fisheries also seemed to be mainly constrained by structural problems related to the Maldivian Industrial Fisheries Corporation (MIFCO), as well as by the condition of tuna stocks and the slump in international tuna prices. 21. The staff team found no evidence of a significant foreign exchange shortage nor of the presence of a parallel foreign exchange market. There had been periodic shortages of foreign exchange in the past, largely reflecting the seasonal nature of tourism and the manner in which the MMA had been providing foreign exchange to the market (mainly over an exchange counter, with limits on individual transaction amounts for both individuals and businesses). The team felt that a more active intervention policy could be employed by MMA to smooth out this seasonal pattern. The team also suggested that a wider trading band (currently less than 1 percent) could be used to give more leeway to banks in setting buying and selling rates, and thereby provide a better gauge of underlying conditions in the foreign exchange market. The authorities agreed that some relaxation of the current rigid arrangement would be desirable. However, they felt that the timing was important as a widening of the trading band under conditions of strong demand for foreign currency would be viewed as a devaluation and undermine confidence. There was full agreement that a move to a more flexible exchange rate regime was not opportune at present. The authorities indicated that they had not yet reached a decision on whether to accept the obligations of Article VIII; the staff team urged them to do so as soon as possible. D. SOE Reform 22. The staff team stressed that Maldives’ continued economic development based on a growing private sector required reforms of the SOE sector. The team observed that most SOEs were profit-making operations by virtue of their monopoly positions, rent free use of state-owned land, and economies of scale. However, there were also a number of loss- making enterprises, with MIFCO, being the most significant. MIFCO’s difficult financial position reflected increased competition on foreign markets and weak tuna export prices, but also the income transfer aspects of its operations (through high procurement prices). The staff* argued that, if income support to the fishing communities was to continue, it would be more efficient and transparent to shift it to the budget, thus allowing MIFCO to compete on a level playing field in an increasingly competitive external environment. The authorities agreed that MIFCO’s position was to a large degree the result of the company having been saddled with a non-commercial mandate and they were considering ways in which this burden could be eased or lifted. 23. The staff team encouraged the authorities to begin formulating a plan to gradually retreat from activities which could be more efficiently run by the private Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - Chart 3 Maldives Exchange Rate Developments, 1992-2000 160 142 123 105 87 68 Bilateral exchange rates (1992 Ql=lOO) - - - U.S. dollarhfiyaa - Japanese yenhfiyaa - E~rdrufiyaa - - - Thai bahthfiyaa l...

In the meantime, the playing field for private sector companies should be leveled by removing rent-free use of land for the SOEs, notably the State Trading Organization (STO). With the privatization of non-strategic public enterprises in a competitive environment being the ultimate objective, the process could begin with sale of equity to the general public. This would also contribute to the development of a capital market in Maldives and provide an important investment outlet for the private sector. In considering the privatization of strategic SOEs, the authorities would need to avoid the mere substitution of private monopolies for public monopolies. The authorities, although acknowledging the potential benefits of privatization, were not convinced that it was desirable, or even feasible, at present. They felt that the participation of some SOE (STO, in particular) in importation and distribution was necessary to ensure adequate supplies and prevent excessive price volatility for essential commodities. They also pointed out that SOE profit transfers were a significant component of government revenue, implying privatization would need to be synchronized with the introduction of corporate taxation. E. Other Issues 24. The staff team observed that policy analysis and assessment continued to be hampered by substantial data deficiencies. It encouraged the authorities to quickly establish a committee composed of senior officials of key ministries and government agencies to take stock of data deficiencies and formulate a remedial action plan. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 25. Maldives has prospered over the last two decades as few other countries. Economic development-based mainly on tourism- has also been facilitated by generally sound macroeconomic management, a fairly open trade and exchange system, and a liberal expatriate employment policy. Maldives also benefited from generous donor support. The authorities’ commitment to financial stability was proven in the early 1990s when they successfully quelled significant macroeconomic imbalances created by a rapid succession of adverse external shocks. 26. While growth has remained strong, there are signs of worrying macroeconomic trends. The 2000 budget deficit target is likely to be exceeded by a considerable margin and trend projections suggest that, in the absence of a timely policy response, internal and external imbalances could not be sustained over the medium term. Fundamental reforms are ‘ needed over the medium term to address weaknesses in the policy framework and reduce the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks. 27. Fiscal tightening in the context of a medium-term consolidation program is key to ensuring internal and external sustainability. As the availability of foreign concessional loans becomes more limited, the policy objective should be to move-beginning with the current year-toward a balanced budget over the medium-term. Expenditure restraint should be the principal focus of the fiscal effort. In the current year, an across-the-board cut in administrative spending would be appropriate to curb the deficit overrun. More broadly, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- priority needs to be given to curtailing all unproductive spending and cutting and rationalizing administrative expenditure in the context of comprehensive civil service reform, while protecting social spending. 28. On the revenue side, the main emphasis should be on strengthening and diversifying the base. There is also some scope for revenue increases in the near term- restoring the real value of the tourism tax and substantially reducing customs duty exemptions offer significant potential. Over the medium term, making government revenue more resilient to external shocks entails replacing the import duty regime with a general sales tax, and SOE profits with a corporate income tax. 29. Fiscal prudence and more limited access to MMA financing are essential for an effective monetary policy. There is also considerable scope for improving the monetary policy framework, beginning with the liberalization of rufiyaa interest rates along with the abolishment of the ineffective bank-by-bank credit ceilings. Other important steps are: lowering the very high commercial bank reserve requirements, more active use of MMA CDs in liquidity management, and making preparations for issuance of treasury bills in order to diversify sources of budget financing and begin the process of moving towards monetary management based on indirect instruments. 30. On balance, the pegged exchange rate arrangement has served Maldives well and has been a major source of confidence. The exchange rate arrangement is consistent with the economy’s structure and trade pattern. The competitiveness of the dominant tourism sector has been shielded by the extensive dollarization of the sector and the availability of expatriate labor at low and flexible wages. 31. A plan for SOE reform, including eventual privatization of most enterprises, should be drawn up and implemented. Maldives has a dynamic and efficient private sector--evidenced by the success of tourism-that will be able to carry forward its economic development in future. Establishment of a level playing field for the private sector calls for the removal of most SOE monopolies and the rent-free use of public land. In the case of MIFCO, it would be appropriate to free the company of public policy responsibilities and allow it to compete freely in world markets, 32. A concerted effort should be put into improving Maldives’ economic statistics. Notwithstanding improvements in recent years, inadequacies in macroeconomic data remain l an obstacle to effective policy formulation. A high level, inter-ministerial committee should be formed to identify the shortcomings, formulate a remedial plan, and seek technical support from bilateral and multilateral donors. 33. It is recommended that Maldives remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - Table 1.

Exchange Arrangements From March 1, 1982 to June 30,1985, the Maldivian rufiyaa was pegged to the U.S. dollar. Beginning in July 1985, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was linked to a trade- weighted basket of currencies, but the exchange rate vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar remained relatively stable until February 1987. On March 1, 1987, the rufiyaa was devalued by 29 percent vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. From 1987 to 1994, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was adjusted periodically in line with market forces. However, since October 1994, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa has remained unchanged at Rf 11.77 per U.S. dollar. Maldives continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under the provisions of . Article XIV, but no longer maintains restrictions under Article XIV. VIII.

Two fisheries projects were fully disbursed and completed. The third fisheries project closed on December 3 1, 1997 with some amount undisbursed. The latter has helped improve fish storage and collection facilities, while also providing technical assistance for institutional development. The first education and training project closed in December 1995. Building on this experience, a second education and training project was approved in April 1995. This project focuses on strengthening primary teacher training programs, establishing an in-country junior secondary teacher training program, and increasing secondary school access in the remote islands. The third education and training project ($17.6 million), approved by the Bank’s Board in March 2000, also aims at: further increasing secondary school access in the atoll; expanding the in- l country teacher training capacity and other skill training facilities; supporting/ updating/printing of primary and secondary curriculum and educational materials; supporting the overseas post-secondary training scholarship program; and assisting the Ministry of Education with the strengthening of education and financing. An airport upgrading project that rehabilitated Male’s airport facilities and provided training to its staff was completed in December 1994.

However, problems with the compilation and reporting of basic economic data remain, especially with respect to national accounts, fiscal and balance of payments statistics. Improvement in national accounts and balance of payments statistics will be aided by the enactment of statistical legislation. The main official statistical publication is the Statistical Yearbook of Maldives for which the latest version is 1998. APD also receives, albeit with a lag, the Quarterly Economic Bulletin and the Annual Report of the Maldives Monetary Authority and the Quarterly Fiscal Report from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. National Accounts Only rudimentary production-side national accounts are currently available. The Asian Development Bank is assisting the authorities in setting up a framework for compiling more comprehensive national accounts. Results from this work should begin to be seen in 2000 or 2001. CPI The publication of a CPI was discontinued by the authorities in 1994 because of outdated weights, data inconsistencies and compilation difficulties. In response, a STA expert visited Male in May 1995 to help construct a new CPI series based on a 1993 income and expenditure survey, and to develop new price collection procedures. A new CPI has been compiled since June 1995, which incorporates more stringent data collection procedures. A STA consumer price statistics mission of August 1996 recommended that the authorities develop additional price indices for a more comprehensive analysis of inflation. Government finance In 1996, the authorities resumed regular reporting of data for publication in the GFS Yearbook and the latest published data are for 1998. The latest summary data provided by the Maldives Monetary Authority for publication in IFS pertain to 1999. Balance of payments Following the STA mission of February 1994, a number of measures were taken to improve data coverage and quality for the balance of payments. However, problems of coverage and timing remain with regard to imports. Travel receipts are still estimated on the basis of a small-sample inquiry of resorts/hotels made in February 1994 to determine daily average expenditure by tourists. Estimates of profit remittances and reinvested earnings in the tourism sector are still unsatisfactory. Information on private capital flows is incomplete.
