INTRODUCTIONAND SUMMARY 1. For many years, Kiribati’s economic strategy rested on two pillars: a cautious fiscal policy and state-led development. This strategy maintained macroeconomic stability and built up the country’s external trust fund (the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF)), but resulted in stagnant per capita incomes. In 1995. a new government adopted an expansionary fiscal policy by raising expenditure sharply in order to revitalize economic activity. While this approach gave a temporary boost to growth, it was financed by large and unsustainable drawdowns from the RERF. 2. At the conclusion of the last consultation in June 1997, Directors urged the authorities to return to their traditional cautious fiscal policy and reorient the economy toward private sector-led growth by reducing the role of government. 3. In late 1997, the authorities laid out a new Medium-Term StrotegJ~ that aimed to reduce the role of the public sector and foster private sector activity. However, little progress has been made in implementing the strategy due to the lack of a broad social consensus for reform. 4. The 1999 Article IV mission stressed the need to build support for key reforms, with priority given to reducing the level and improving the quality of government expenditure, including by reforming public enterprises and downsizing the civil service. Efforts to reduce barriers to trade and investment are also needed to lift economic growth. 5. The mission also urged that weakuesses in the statistical database be addressed and that core data be reported to the Fund on a regular basis. II. ECONOMICSETTING A. Economic Background 6. Kiribati is one of the least developed Pacific island economies. Per capita GDP is low, at about USS550 in 1998, and while social indicators have improved, life expectancy remains low (at 59 years) and infant mortality high (at 64 per 1,000 births). Growth has been constrained by a number of structural problems (Box 1). These problems will need to be addressed if the authorities are to succeed in raising living standards and creating jobs for the expected 60 percent increase in the labor force over the next 15 years. 7. Although the production base is narrow (mainly fish and copra), significant potential exists to develop the fishing industry, given Kiribati’s 3% million square kilometer Exclusive Economic Zone. Potential also exists in the tourism industry 8. A large share of government spending and imports is tinanced from external grants and fishing license fees, making the economy vulnerable to a decline in donor Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- Box 1, Why was Growth Low in the 1980s and Early 199Os? Kiribati’s real GDP growth averaged only 1% percent a year in the 1980s and early 1990s. Given annual population growth of about 2 percent, this led to a decline in real GDP per capita by about 5 percent over this period. The lacklustcr growth performance can be traced to a number of weaknesses in structural policy, many of which are common to Pacific island economies, including: a large and inefficient public sector that crowds out the private sector; an inefftcient tax system; an unclear system of land titles; price controls; government subsidies (especially to public enterprises and producers of copra); limited competition in the financial sector; and complicated procedures for foreign direct investment. Other less policy-related factors have also constrained growth, such as Kiribati’s remoteness from international markets; the wide dispersion of its population over a large number of small islands; and the lack of skilled labor. support rnd a loss of fishing revenues.’ However, Kiribati’s sizable external assets (mainly in the RBRF, Box 2) provide a buffer against temporary revenue shocks. Box 2. Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund Origin. The Revenue Eqnalization Rcscrve Fund (RERF) was established by the British colonial administration in 1956 to hold royalties from phosphate mining in trust for the people of Kiribati in light of the foreseeable depletion of the deposits. By 1979, when Kiribati gained independence and the phosphate mine closed, the value of the Fund had grown to $A 69 million (I % times GDP). Purpose. The main objective of the Fund is to provide sustained financing of government expenditure for the benefit of both current and fttturc generations. Administration. The Fund is administered by a committee of senior ofticials which is required to tile quarterly and annual reports on operations with parliament, whose approval is needed for drawdowns. Management. The Fund is managed by two brokerage firms, which are monitored by a custodian. Comprehensive audits are made every six years, with the last audit in 1996. At end- 1998, the Fund had reached $A 570 million (8 times GDP) and was well diversified, with investments in 25 currencies (one-third in U.S. dollars and one-third in Australian dollars), evenly split between equities and bonds, B. Recent Developments and Near-Term Outlook 9. Real GDP growth picked up from low rates in the early 1990s to average 4% percent in the past foor years, reflecting a temporary boost from increased ‘Fees are based on the reported value of the catch of foreign fishing vessels in Kiribati waters.

Public investment and the civil service wage bill were increased sharply in the mid-1990s. financed initially by unsustainably large drawdowns from the RERF and more recently from a favorable revenue shock (due to a sharp increase in the fish catch by foreign vessels) and higher external grants. The Asian crisis had little direct impact on the economy. IO. Inflation, which has been low, picked up moderately to almost 5 percent in 1998, reflecting import supply problems due to the breakdown of the crane at the main port and the depreciation of the Australian dollar (which is the legal tender), with Kiribati’s nominal effective exchange rate index falling 10 percent in 1998. 11. The budget balance improved from an overall deficit of more than 35 percent of GDP in 1996 to a surplus of 24 percent of GDP in 1998, despite a lack of progress in reducing expenditure. The sharp swing was due to a jump in fishing license revenue to almost 60 percent of GDP (double normal levels) in the wake of strong El Niiio climatic conditions that boosted the catch in Kiribati waters (Table 2 and Figure 2). No drawdowns from the RERF were needed in 1998, and reserves in the Consolidated and Development Funds rose.’ Current expenditure, however, remained very high at more than 70 percent of GDP. 12. The jump in fishing license revenue also contributed to an improvement in the external position, with the current account deficit (excluding grants) narrowing sharply to 3 percent of GDP in 1998 (Table 3 and Figure 3). The decline in the current account deficit, together with external grants. led to a sizable overall surplus and a rise in official external assets. Valuation gains in the RERF (from the rise in world bond and equity prices and the depreciation of the Australian dollar) also contributed to an increase in external assets to the equivalent of more than 8 times GDP at the end of last year. Public external debt remained low, and was on highly concessional terms (with no short-term debt).’ 13. The depreciation of the Australian dollar since mid-1997 has improved external competitiveness. Kiribati’s real effective exchange rate index (based on relative consumer price indices) in March 1999 had fallen to IO percent below the average for 1994-97, but this fall has offset only part of the estimated increase in private sector labor costs that followed the 30 percent rise in civil service wage rates in the mid-1990s. Nonetheless, labor costs do not influence the major items in the balance of payments (i.e., fishing license fees, external grants, and investment income). *The Consolidated Fund is used to finance current expenditure while the Development Fund finances development expenditure. Both are separate from the RERF ‘No data are available on private sector external debt, but the authorities considered that it was small.

The key policy development in recent years was the government’s adoption of a Medium-Term S’trntegy in 1997, which focuses on the need to reduce the role of the public sector in order to promote the development of R dynamic private sector, but only limited progress has been made in its implementation (Box 3). An important slippage was the failure to implement the planned freeze on civil service recruitment, with the number of civil servants increasing by 2 percent in 1998 and budgeted to increase by a further 3 percent in 1999. As a result, the level of recurrent government spending remains very high (at 7 1% percent of GDP or 42% percent of GNP in I999).’ In other areas, some reform measures have been taken. Importantly, a decision has been made to improve the accountability of public enterprises (by requiring better reporting of their performance and the preparation of strategic plans before budgetary support is provided), but few enterprises have begun to operate on a commercial basis and there has been no privatization. In addition, some progress has been made toward clarifying land titles. The government’s review of the Medium-Term Strategy in February 1999 acknowledged the slow progress and highlighted the need for further action to implement the strategy fully. Box 3.

Economic activity will be supported by the commencement of an Asian Development Bank (AsDB) water and sanitation project, while inflation is expected to fall to 2 percent in 1999, broadly in line with trading partners. 111. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 16. The consultation discussions focused on the reasons behind the slow progress in implementing the authorities’ reform strategy and the medium-term challenge of encouraging growth by putting in place a sustainable tiscal policy framework and pushing ahead with structural reforms. Fiscal and structural policies are of central importance in Kiribati given the current monetary link to the Australian dollar (which the mission supported as it has helped to enforce policy discipline). A. Assessment of the Overall Strategy 17. The mission broadly endorsed the authorities’ Me&nt-Tcmr Stmfcgy and discussed the reasons for the delays in policy implementation that would limit growth prospects if they persisted. The authorities considered that a lack of a broad consensus for reform had hindered progress in implementing the strategy. The Minister of Finance publicly reaffirmed his commitment to the MeJirrm-Term Srrutegy in his 1999 Budget speech, and explained to the mission that he hoped to build wider support for reform within parliament by holding seminars to explain the rationale behind the reform strategy. The mission stressed the importance of such an effort. and presented a baseline medium-term scenario which showed a weak outlook for growth in the absence of reform (Annex I). 18. The mission also presented ao alternative scenario, which assumes that a sustainable fiscal framework and structural reforms are pot in place (Annex I). Under this scenario, real GDP growth of at least 3 percent could be achieved over the medium term, implying per capita real growth of I percent. The small size of the private sector, however, will constrain the growth and export response in the near term. as will the spending cuts needed to achieve a sustainable fiscal position (see below). Nonetheless, signiticant gains should come from higher private sector investment over time and a switch of scarce skilled workers from the public to the private sector, together with improved public sector services once reforms are implemented. The scenario is consistent with a narrowing of the current account deficit (excluding grants) by 2004 and inflation in line with trading partners of about 3 percent. The authorities broadly agreed with the scenario and saw that reform was needed to raise living standards and create jobs on a sustainable basis. They believed that the private sector would respond well to reform, and cited the example of the efficient and inexpensive private minibus service that grew rapidly following the closure of the poor quality government-owned bus operation.

Over the medium term, the mission urged that current expenditure be reduced in order to lower the tax burden and support private sector growth. The mission considered that current expenditure could be scaled back to less than 60 percent of GDP by 2004, which was about the expenditure ratio prior to the expansion of fiscal policy in the mid- 1990s (see table below and the alternative scenario in Annex I).’ This would be consistent with sustainable revenue of 55 percent of GDP, external grants of I9 percent of GDP,6 and financing of 12 percent of GDP, which would allow a cut in tax revenue of 5 percent of GDP. The authorities agreed that the spending cuts could be achieved by reducing budgetary support for public enterprises and downsizing the civil service, even while raising spending in their priority areas of education, health, social welfare, and environmental protection.

Kiribati’s higher expenditure allows for the added cost of providing government services to its geographically more dispersed population. ‘In line with indications from two of the major donors (Australia and New Zealand) concerning the prospective level of support over the medium term Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- 20. The authorities’ three-year budget projections, however, show little progress in fiscal consolidation in 1999 and later years, as current expenditure to GDP remains above 70 percent of GDP by 2001 (Annex I, baseline scenario). The mission emphasized the need to take early steps toward trimming current expenditure to a sustainable level. 21. The mission, nonetheless, supported the authorities’ intention to use the Consolidmted Fund to finance almost half the budget deficit of more than 30 percent of GDP in 1999, with the remainder of the deficit financed from RERF drawdowns and the AsDB loan for the water and sanitation project. The authorities stated that the Consolidated Fund had been created to act as a buffer against temporary falls in revenue (as expected in 1999 with the fall in fishing license revenue), and that the balances in the Fund had risen in 1996 and 1997 because of the exceptionally high fishing license revenue. The mission noted that use of the Consolidated Fund should not delay progress with fiscal adjustment and that the Fund should be replenished over time to provide a buffer against future temporary falls in revenue. 22. The missiou recommended that only o limited portion of income from the RERF be used to finance the budget iu order to sustain this financing over the long term. The mission’s analysis shows that use of income from the RERF equivalent to IO percent of GDP should be sustainable over the long term (see Annex II). This implies drawdowns of $A 7-8 million in 1999 and 2000, somewhat lower than the current limit of $A 12% million approved by parliament. The authorities broadly agreed with the analysis and stated their commitment to preserve the capacity of the RERF to sustain financing over the long term. Donors agreed with the mission that limited use should be made of the RERF to finance expenditure, given the present high level and poor quality of expenditure (see below). 23. The budget’s focus on educntion, health, social welfare, and environmental protection was supported by the mission RS it should improve the effectiveness of expenditure. The World Bank’s Public Expenditure Review in June 1998 noted that health and education spending was high. but that the quality was poor with inadequate nonwage expenditure. in line with the Bank’s analysis, the mission advised an increase in nonwage spending (especially on repairs and maintenance) and a refocusing of expenditure on preventive health services and primary school education. 24. The mission welcomed recent improvements in the budgeting framework, especially the adoption of three-yerr budget estimates, which should improve liscnl policy formulation. Progress has also been made in setting performance standards for output- based budgeting and increasing fiscal transparency. with assistance from the AsDB and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Fiji,’ but these efforts need to be taken further, importantly by holding ministries accountable for achieving outputs. ‘PFTAC is a multi-donor financed agency, for which the Fund serves as executing agency.

Public enterprise reform was considered by the mission to be a priority on the reform agenda as the performance of most public enterprises remains poor (Box 4). The mission recommended that more emphasis be placed on privatization, together with exposure to competition, given that wholly government-owned enterprises have performed worse than partially privatized enterprises. As a first step, the mission recommended that the Commercialization Committee proposed in the Akditrm-Term Slrul~)w be established. The next essential step would be to hold the management of public enterprises accountable for their performance and impose hard budget constraints, including by removing budgetaty support and tax exemptions (in line with the recent policy decision to require greater accountability). while allowing enterprises to set their prices on a commercial basis. Moreover, the mission recommended that candidates for privatization be identified at an early stage.* A viable option could be partial privatization, with a strategic foreign partner (to bring capital and expertise) coupled with broad-based local ownership. The authorities noted the political opposition to privatization. but stated that they were trying to develop a consensus for such an approach. Civil service reform 26. The mission strongly supported the authorities’ intention to downsize the civil service, especially given the significant increase in the past five years.’ The task force that was recently established to review the civil service needs to identify where resources can be shifted to high priority areas, while reducing the overall size of the wage bill. The mission noted that civil service employment should not be considered a form of social welfare, as this attitude would adversely affect the quality of government services, while targeting “welfare” payments for better skilled workers, and therefore, the less needy segment of the population. The mission emphasized that civil service reform would not only lower expenditure, but would also encourage skilled workers to move to the private sector. A downsizing could be achieved with a suitable redundancy package (possibly externally financed)‘” to act as a safety net and provide resources for redundant workers to establish private enterprises. *This recommendation is in line with those of the World Bank’s 1998 Prrhlic Ex~~~&rrre Rcvi~w and the AsDB’s 1997 Economic Reprr. ‘The civil service wage bill rose by two-thirds between 1994 and 1998 and at about 17 percent of GNP in 1998, it was larger than in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga (at IO- 14 percent of GNP). “The AsDB is a possible source of financing, as it has supported similar reforms in the region.

Public enterprises dominate economic aclivity in Klrihati. hut the performance of most wholly govemmenl- owned enterprises has been poor. They have made sizable losses (see table below), provided poor services, and crowded out the private sector by opemting on n noncommercial basis. Their perfomumce has lowered economy-wide efficieocy and caused n sizable drain on the hudget (including through subsidies that averaged more than 4 percent of GDP during 1995-98, govenlment-guawlteed loans. and tax exemptions). The reasons for the poor performance of the wholly government-owned public enterprises include: . The lack of commcrcisl orientation. Managers are not giveo full discretion to operate on a commercial hasis, ns many public enterprises are instruments of public policy used to deliver essential public services. Importantly, thelr pricing policy is often determined by govemment, which undercuts the privale sector (this is made possible hy government subsidies, a run-down of assets, and asset replacement iimdcd hy the government or external donors). .

The mission recommended tax reform in order to address an important barrier to trade and investment. The tax base is narrow at present, with the bulk of tax revenue coming from import tariffs, and tariff rates are high (up to 80 percent) which discourages trade and investment. The mission recommended: reducing tariff rates to O-I 5 percent while removing exemptions; moving import tariffs from a f.o.b. to a c.i.f, basis;” and considering a single-stage retail sales tax to broaden the tax base.r* The impact on revenue would be broadly neutral, but tax rates could be lowered as expenditure is reduced. The authorities are considering tax reform but were concerned that the prices of some consumer items would rise. Other barriers to trade and investment 28. The mission ooted that other barriers to trade and investment needed to be reduced to foster growth. The lack of clarity of land titles is a barrier to private sector investment and growth, and while some progress is being made in clarifying titles, further efforts are required. The complicated nature of procedures for foreign direct investment also constrain investment and need to be simplified.” Price controls on a number of basic consumer goods distort market signals and the mission urged their removal once the proposed Consumer Protection Act was in place. Moreover, the administered price of copra should be lowered as it is well above the level implied by world prices (given the subsidy of I % percent of GDP per annum in the past four years) which hinders diversification of economic activity. The authorities were reluctant to remove price controls and subsidies as such action would adversely affect the population on the outer islands. However, they agreed that making the costs more transparent by replacing price controls with explicit subsidies from the budget would help to phase them down over time. D. Financial Sector Policy 29. The mission stressed the need for reform to increase the availability of credit to the private sector. The bulk of deposits with the two main institutions-the Bank of Kiribati “In line with international practice, and to overcome the problem of overstatement of the freight component (which is sizable given Kiribati’s remoteness) in an effort to evade tax. ‘*These recommendations are broadly in line with the findings of studies by the World Bank in 1997 and the IMP Fiscal Affairs Department in 1992. The PFTAC has also provided technical assistance on tax and customs administration in recent years. The proposed reform would reduce the average tariff collections rate from about 18 percent to I l- 12 percent of imports. j3A 1997 report by the Foreign Investment Advisory Service, a subsidiary of the World Bank, recommended a number of measures, including amending foreign investment legislation to improve transparency and remove discretion, establishing a negative list for investors, and simplifying the process of allowing investors to bring in technical experts.

A major constraint on the availability of credit arises from the fact that the BoK is not permitted to use land as collateral, as companies with foreign ownership are restricted from owning land. The mission recommended that ways be found to allow the BoK to secure a claim over land. perhaps by increasing the use of transferable land leases. The mission also advised against providing government guarantees to spur credit growth, as it could create moral hazard and lead to fiscal costs.” Instead. it noted that the key to increasing credit is through structural reform that creates profitable projects in the private sector. 30. The mission recommended that financial sector policy focus on ensuring the health of the system while avoiding further recourse to budgetary support Of the main financial institutions, the BoK is very profitable with a low level of nonperforming loans, but the Development Bank of Kiribati (DBK) has bad loans at 7% percent of its assets (arising from weaknesses in credit risk assessment), while the KPF has eroded its reserves in recent years by paying a fixed interest rate of I3 % percent on members’ funds (in excess of its return on assets). The mission supported plans to recapitalize the DBK and strengthen its management, but recommended no further assistance beyond the current budget plans.” It urged the authorities to lower the interest rate paid by the KPF and vary it in line with its return on assets, in order to avoid a government bailout (which could cost 6 percent of GDP by 2000), while undertaking an actuarial study at an early stage. The mission also endorsed the intention to introduce banking legislation and establish a minimal set of prudential guidelines, as this would form a sound basis for attracting another commercial bank. The mission stressed that efforts to attract another commercial bank to enhance competition should be on a purely commercial basis. E. Data and Other Issues 31. Kiribati’s macroeconomic data has improved in recent years, but weaknesses remain in government finance, national accounts, and balance of payments statistics. The mission urged that the quality, coverage. and timeliness of data be improved by increasing the resources of the national statistics otlice and fully utilizing technical assistance, including from 14A credit guarantee scheme was proposed by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in its review of the financial sector in Kiribati, prepared in August 1998. The mission raised its concerns about the scheme with the author of the ESCAP report who expressed some sympathy with the mission’s view, noting that such a system would only work under a tightly supervised arrangement. “The government has budgeted a grant to the DBK of $A I million in 1999 (in addition to grams of $A 1.2 million in recent years) and the European Investment Bank has agreed to lend the DBK about $A 3 million. The government has no plans to privatize the DBK.

Although awareness of the year 2000 problem is high in some areas, such IIS the telecommunication and Financial sectors, progress is slow in other areas (including the Public Utilities Board). The mission urged early action to address the remaining problems. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 33. Kirihrti’s traditional reliance on cautious tiscrl policy and state-led development was successful in mrintnining low inflation and building external assets, but failed to achieve sustained economic growth. Although the activist fiscal policy undertaken in the mid- 1990s has given a temporary boost to growth, it has raised current government expenditure to unsustainable levels. 34. The authorities recognize that a sustained increase in living standards can only he achieved by encouraging the private sector to take the lead in economic development. Appropriately, they aim to achieve this by scaling back the role of the public sector and reducing barriers to trade and investment. Progress under this strategy. however, has been limited and further efforts are needed to build a social consensus for reform. 35. Consistent with the authorities’ mim to scale back the public sector, the priority for fiscal policy should he to reduce the level nnd improve the quality of government expenditure. The level of current expenditure should be cut back over the medium term to a sustainable level ofjust under 60 percent of GDP, which was the ratio prior to the expansion of fiscal policy in the mid-1990s. Such a cut back in spending would allow some tax cuts and limit drawdowns from the RERF to a sustainable level, while accommodating increased outlays on health. education, social welfare, and environmental protection. The authorities’ three-year budget projections. however, show little progress in fiscal consolidation and early steps are needed toward trimming current expenditure to a sustainable level. For 1999, it is appropriate to use the Consolidated Fund to help finance the sizable budget deficit, given that the deficit stems from an expected fall in fishing license revenue to below normal levels. Nonetheless, use of the Consolidated Fund should not delay progress with fiscal adjustment. 36. Public enterprise reform and a downsizing of the civil service should take top priority on the structural reform rgendn. The poor performance of most public enterprises not only burdens the budget but adversely affects economic efftciency More emphasis is needed on privatization to improve the performance of public enterprises, together with efforts to encourage competition. Civil service reform is also needed to reduce government expenditure and release skilled workers to the private sector. A downsizing could be achieved with a suitable redundancy package (possibly externally financed) to act as a safety net. “PFTAC provided assistance on balance of payments and national accounts statistics in 1994.

A reduction in barriers to trade and investment, along with reforms in the tinancial sector, are also important to encourage private sector activity and build the export base. Import tariff reform should aim to achieve lower and more uniform tariffs, while price controls and subsidies should be phased out. Further progress is also required on clarifying land titles and simplifying procedures for foreign direct investment. Financial sector reforms should remove barriers to the availability of credit to the private sector while ensuring the health ofthe financial system by introducing a minimal set of prudential guidelines. 38. Fund surveillance of Kiribati has been hindered by weaknesses in the statistical base (especially government finance, national accounts, and balance of payments statistics) and the lack of regular reporting of core data to the Fund. The authorities should provide more resources for the national statistical offtce to address the main weaknesses and follow through on their commitment to improve the flow of data to the Fund. 39. It is proposed that Kiribati continue on the 24-month cycle for the next Article IV consultation.

The baseline scenario assumes that the recent lack of progress with fiscal adjustment and structural reform continues over the medium term. The alternative scenario assumes timely implementation of the authorities’ Medium-Term Sfrule~. Baseline scenario (Table 1.1) For fiscal policy, it is assumed that the present level of current expenditure is maintained in real terms (in line with the three-year budget projections), implying a small reduction relative to GDP (to just under 70 percent by 2004).’ Development expenditure is projected to rise over the next three years, as the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) water and sanitation project is implemented and the construction of schools and a new port continues, before declining to just over 30 percent of GDP by 2004. The sustainable level of external financing is considered to be 20-25 percent of GDP, with the remaining development expenditure financing coming from domestic funds. Total revenue is expected to decline sharply in 1999 due to a fall in fishing license revenue because La NiRa conditions are expected to reduce the catch in Kiribati waters (unlike El Niiro conditions in the past two years that boosted the catch), and then return to normal levels thereafter. in line with sustainable fishing license revenue of 25-30 percent of GDP.2 The scenario assumes a recurrence of La Nifia conditions in 2002 that would temporarily reduce revenue. Tax revenue is assumed to remain at 25-27 percent of GDP. Sizable fiscal deficits arise from the above assumptions, which would need to be financed from external loans (mainly the AsDB) and external assets. The Consolidated Fund is assumed to finance almost half of the deficits in La Niha years, while annual financing from the RERF of $A 12% million (16 percent of GDP in 2000) is assumed. This is in line with the upper limit established by parliament but is higher than the level considered sustainable by the mission (see Annex II). Real GDP growth is projected to slow to about zero by 2002, as public investment projects are completed and current expenditure is kept constant in real terms. ThereaRer. potential growth is assumed to be about I % percent per annum comparable with the experience of the ‘No allowance is made for the possible costs of bailing out the KPF if its current policies are maintained. ‘The authorities noted that this level of revenue is consistent with sustaining commercial fish stocks (mainly tuna) in the Pacific. as assessed by the South Pacific Forum. They also noted efforts to improve the monitoring of foreign fishing vessels in Kiribati waters, including the placement of Kiribati observers on vessels and the introduction of a satellite-based vessel locator system (in collaboration with the South Pacific Forum’s fishing agency) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - ANNEX1 1980s and early 1990s due to the lack ofreform. Inflation is expected to be about 3 percent, at the upper end of Australia’s 2-3 percent target. The overall external balance is expected to remain in surplus, while the current account balance would fall into deficit in 1999-2002 due to higher project-related imports, which are financed by capital transfers and loans. Alternative scenario (Table 1.2) The alternative scenario assumes timely implementation of the Md;wn-Term Sfrafe~, with a scaling back of the public sector and a reduction in barriers to investment and trade. A comprehensive public enterprise reform is assumed to begin in 2000, including privatization and the phasing out of budgetary support by 2003. Civil service reform is also assumed to begin in 2000. with a I5 percent reduction in the wage bill and severance pay equivalent to two years’ salary Four-fifths of the cost is assumed to be financed by external loans. The downsizing would reduce the civil service to about the level of the early-1990s. in line with the scale of recent downsizings supported by the AsDB in the region. Nonetheless, these assumptions should be considered illustrative only, and the nature of the reform should be assessed by the recently established civil service reform task force. The above reforms would enable a cut in current expenditure to less than 60 percent of GDP by 2004. At the same time. about one-third of the savings from civil service and public enterprise reform could be used to increase spending on the authorities’ core areas of health and education. Moreover, the adjustment would make it possible to reduce tax revenue to 20 percent of GDP and RERF income use to a sustainable level of about IO percent of GDP. Real GDP growth is projected to strengthen from 2001 onward. as the stimulative effect of reform offsets the negative impact of lower government spending. After a slowing of growth in 2002 (with the completion of major public investment projects), potential growth could rise to 3 percent or more per annum, implying real per capita growth of over I percent per annum. Growth is likely to be led by the fishing industry, given the large marine resources. The private sector’s commercial involvement in this sector is small at present (aside from the foreign fishing vessels), reflecting the lack of availability of credit and the lack of airline connections to international markets for fresh fish (efforts are currently underway to facilitate private commercial airline connections). Once these constraints are addressed, private sector fishing activity is likely to pick up considerably. There is also potential to develop the tourism industry (including in the specialized areas of game fishing and diving) and it is possible that further phosphate could be extracted from the phosphate mine, given recent advances in technology. Under this scenario, the current account balance would improve over time, reflecting higher export growth, while inflation w&Id be about 3 percent (as in the baseline).

This Annex presents an analysis of whether the authorities’ planned drawdowns from the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) is consistent with their stated objective of limiting the use of income to a level that can be sustained over the long term Specilically, the policy aims to ensure that both current and future generations use a similar level of the RERF’s resources (as a percentage of GDP) to finance government expenditure. To assess whether the current level of the annual drawdown approved by parliament of $A 12% million (or I5 percent of GDP in 1999) can be sustained as a proportion of GDP over the long term, projections of the real value per capita of the Fund were made (out to the year 2050) based on the following conservative assumptions (although it should be borne in mind that significant uncertainty surrounds the possible outcomes): The average value of the RERF for 1996-98 is used as the starting value for the analysis, in order to allow for the possible reversal of some of the valuation gains in 1997 and 1998 from the strong rise in world equity and bond prices and the depreciation of the Australian dollar. A nominal rate of return (including interest, dividends, and capital gains) of 6% percent annually is used, somewhat lower than historical trends due to the fall in global yields in recent years. This is about %-I percentage point higher than long-term bond yields in Australia and the United States in May 1999 as it includes a small premium on investment in equities (as was the case historically). Population growth of 2 percent per annum is used (in line with the recent trend), declining to I % percent after 2020. Real GDP growth of 3 percent per annum, in line with the alternative scenario in Annex I. CPI inflation of 3 percent per annum, as in Annex I Under these assumptions, the maintenance of drawdowns from the RERF at current levels of 15 percent of GDP over the long term would erode the real per capita value of the Fund by about 90 percent by 2050 (see authorities’ scenario in the table below) The analysis suggests that use of income from the RERF would need to be reduced to about 10 percent of GDP to be sustainable over the long term. Such a level would broadly maintain the real value per capita of the Fund through 2050 (see alternative scenario below).

Kiribati has few statistical publications, and weaknesses remain in the statistics on government finance, national accounts, and balance of payments. Technical assistance is needed in these areas, including from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre. 1. Real sector Technical assistance in national accounts was provided by the Asian Development Bank (1989), the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (1994). and Statistics Department (STA) (1995). Estimates of GDP at constant prices by industry are available for the period 1979 to 1998; however, the quality of the deflators and of the survey data needs further improvement. There are no expenditure-based estimates of GDP. The monthly retail price index (1996 = 100) is now produced with a lag of about two months, based on a survey in Tarawa. The weights were updated recently to reflect the 1996 household survey. There are no producer. wholesale, or trade price indices. 2. Government finrnce Kiribati does not report government finance statistics (GFS) data to STA for publication in the 03 Yearbook and in IFS. The latest available data based on GFS classification is for 1994, with the data for 1995 under compilation, and the provisional budget outcome is available for 1998. 3. B&wee of payments The latest balance of payments estimates reported by Kiribati are for 1998. The large net errors and omissions in the balance of payments data appear to reflect the underestimation of private transfers, including seamen’s remittances and other foreign exchange receipts. Quarterly trade statistics are available with a time lag of eight months, while monthly foreign reserves data are available with a time lag of about a month. Consistency between the balance of payments data and budget and financial sector data needs improvement. 4. Monetary accounts Kiribati does not report monetary accounts to STA. Quarterly balance sheets are available for the Bank of Kiribati, while annual balance sheets are available for the Development Bank of Kiribati, and the Kiribati Provident Fund.

To date, the Bank has not provided any IDA credits to Kiribati and there are no future lending activities under consideration at this time. In terms of nonlending economic and sector work. the most recent activities include: Tariff Review (1997): The review recommended a number of changes io the import tariff schedules, essentially to convert tariffs to a c.i.f basis. reduce the number of categories and to rationalize the level of tariffs. Support to the manugemeut of the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) (1997): A report on the RERF recommended significant changes to the management of the Fund which would enhance the real growth of the fund. Educrtion Financing and Costs Study (1998): The review examined the various alternatives for development, expansion. and upgrading of the education system. Public Expenditure Review (1998): The review assessed the development effectiveness of public expenditures and related issues of sustainable economic growth, poverty alleviation, fiscal management and expenditure control, governance, and the efticient use of foreign aid flows, and suggested appropriate improvements. Public islands stakeholder participation in development-Kiribati (1998): The study examined the way in which I-Kiribati social fabric, cultural heritage, and traditions influence the pattern and prospects for development, particularly in terms of social change and economic decision making. The biennial Regional.Economic Report produced by the Bank continues to provide analysis of the key issues facing Kiribati and other Pacific island member countries. The most recent Regional Economic Report, produced in October 1998. focused on enhancing the role of government in Pacific island economies. ‘Prepared by World Bank staff.

In addition, technical assistance amounting to US$7.7 million has been provided for 30 projects. The first loan for Kiribati since 1990 was approved by the AsDB on December 18, 1998 for a Sanitation, Public Health, and Environment Improvement project. The loan for US.SlO.2 million is expected to improve the development potential of Kiribati and the health and well being of its population through a sustained program of improvements in water supply, sewerage, solid waste disposal, and environment conservation. The loan is accqmpanied by two technical assistance grants, totaling US.fi1.5 million, to assist the Public Utilities Board in the implementation ofits restructuring plan and the Ministry of Environment and Social Development in carrying out Community development and participation initiatives in water. sanitation, and environment conservation. The AsDB’s approach to Kiribati remains focused primarily on public sector reforms and infrastructure improvements in Tarawa. In the AsDB’s view, the government needs to show a higher commitment to more fundamental public sector reform. The AsDB’s strategy is to remain engaged in its dialogue for gradual structural changes toward a more efficient public sector and the opening up of the economy to the private sector. This is proposed to be achieved through AsDB’s technical assistance program for strengthening of financial .and economic management.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Kiribati On June _, 1999, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Kiribatil. Background 1. Real GDP growth picked up from low rates in the early 1990s to average 4% percent in the past four years, reflecting a temporary boost from increased government spending. Public investment and the civil service wage bill were increased sharply in the mid-1990s, financed initially by unsustainably large drawdowns from the country’s trust fund (the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF)) and more recently from a favorable revenue shock (due to a sharp increase in the fish catch by foreign vessels) and higher external grants. The Asian crisis had little direct impact on the economy. 2. Inflation, which has been low, picked up moderately to almost 5 percent in 1998, reflecting import supply problems due to the breakdown of the crane at the main port and the depreciation of the Australian dollar (which is the legal tender), with Kiribati’s nominal effective exchange rate index failing 10 percent in 1998. 3. The budget balance improved from an overall deficit of more than 35 percent of GDP in 1996 to a surplus of 24 percent of GDP in 1998, despite a lack of progress in ‘Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicANNEX VIII - 36 - reducing expenditure. The sharp swing was due to a jump in fishing license revenue to almost 60 percent of GDP (double normal levels) in the wake of strong El NiAo climatic conditions that boosted the catch in Kiribati waters. No drawdowns from the RERF were needed in 1998, and reserves in the Consolidated and Development Funds rose.’ Current expenditure, however, remained very high at more than 70 percent of GDP. 4. The jump in fishing license revenue also contributed to an improvement in the external position, with the current account deflclt (excluding grants) narrowing sharply to 3 percent of GDP In 1998. The decline in the current account deficit, together with external grants, led to a sizable overall surplus and a rise in official external assets. Valuation gains in the RERF (from the rise in world bond and equity prices and the depreciation of the Australian dollar) also contributed to an increase in external assets to the equivalent of more than 8 times GDP at the end of last year. Public external debt remained low, and was on highly concessional terms (with no short-term debt).3 5. The depreciation of the Australian dollar since mid-1997 has improved external competitiveness. Kiribati’s real effective exchange rate index (based on relative consumer price indices) in March 1999 had fallen to 10 percent below the average for 1994-97, but this fall has offset only pari of the estimated.increase in private sector labor costs that followed the 30 percent rise in civil service wage rates in the mid-1990s. Nonetheless, labor costs do not influence the major items in the balance of payments (i.e., fishing license fees, external grants, and investment income). Recent Policy Developments 6. The key policy development in recent years was the government’s adoption of a Medium-Term Strategy in 1997, which focuses on the need to reduce the role of the public sector in order to promote the development of a dynamic private sector, but only llmlted progress has been made In Its implementation. An important slippage was the failure to implement the planned freeze on civil service recruitment, with the number of civil servants increasing by 2 percent in 1998 and budgeted to increase by a further 3 percent in 1999. As a result, the level of recurrent government spending remains very high (at 7.1% percent of GDP or 42% percent of GNP in 1999).4 In other areas, some reform measures have been taken. *The Consolidated Fund is used to finance current expenditure while the Development Fund finances development expenditure. Both are separate from the RERF. ‘No data are available on private sector external debt, but the authorities considered that it was small. 4GNP is much higher than GDP, reflecting the sizable income from fishing license fees, external assets, and seamen’s remittances.

In addition, some progress has been made toward clarifying land titles. The government’s review of the Medium- Term Sfrategy in February 1999 acknowledged the slow progress and highlighted the need for further action to implement the strategy fully. Outlook for 1999 7. The near-term outlook is for relatively slow growth and a fall in revenue from fishing licenses (reflecting a reversal of climatic conditions) which will cause the budget and external current account balances to return to sizable deficits (more than 30 percent and 20 percent of GDP, respectively). Economic activity will be supported by the commencement of an Asian Development Bank (AsDB) water and sanitation project, while inflation is expected to fall to 2 percent in 1999, broadly in line with trading partners.
