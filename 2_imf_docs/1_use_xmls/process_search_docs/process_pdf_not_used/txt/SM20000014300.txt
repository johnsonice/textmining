Chabrier and M. Ahmed June 29,200O D Discussions for the 2000 Article IV consultation were held in Teheran during April 29- May 14, 2000. D The staff team consisted of Messrs. Iqbal (head), Shabsigh, and Adedeji, Ms. Choueiri (all MED), Mr. Swinburne (MAE), and Mr. Taube (FAD). Mr. Miralchor, Executive Director, participated in the discussions. B The authorities were represented by Governor Nourbakhsh; Deputy Governors Mojarrad and Komijani; Mr. Neeli, Deputy Minister of the Plan and Budget Organization; Mr. Nahavandian, Deputy Minister of Commerce; senior officials of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs; National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC); commercial banks; and the private sector, including the largest foundation. l In concluding the 1999 Article IV consultation discussions with Iran on March 19, 1999, Directors commended the authorities for embarking on a new strategy that aimed at fiscal consolidation to reduce inflation, restoration of market-based prices, and removal of other barriers to sustained growth. They encouraged the authorities to build upon these steps in the period ahead to comprehensively address structural rigidities and called upon the staff to work with them to establish a basis for the use of Fund resources in support of their continued reform effort. Owing to the strengthening of Iran’s external position following higher world oil prices, the authorities decided not to seek the use of Fund resources but have maintained policy dialogue with the staff as a means for formulating and implementing their reform package. A joint Fund/World Bank mission conducted the Financial Sector Assessment Program in February-March 2000. l Iran continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV. It also maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices that are subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. l The principal author of this report is Mr. Iqbal.

Output and employment performance of the Iranian economy is constrained by the administrative allocation of resources through a dominant state enterprise sector and state- owned banking sector, under officially mandated financial rates of return, low petroleum product prices, trade restrictions, and multiple exchange rates. The Islamic Republic of Iran, however, has a tradition of budgetary prudence and small debt. Recent developments. In 1999/2000, important policy reforms were initiated, including a 70 percent increase in domestic petroleum product prices, the introduction of more market- based Teheran Stock Exchange (TSE) exchange rate, and initiation of steps to reform the financial sector. The 77 percent increase in oil export prices improved the external position; the external current account shifted to a surplus equivalent to 4.7 percent of GDP, the debt/GDP ratio fell to 10 percent, and the gross official reserves rose to the equivalent of about five months of imports from less than three months in the previous year. The budget shifted from a deficit of almost 7 percent of GDP in 1998/99 to a surplus of about 1 percent of GDP. Inflation moderated but growth remained subdued owing to the underlying structural distortions and drought. Implicit subsidies remained high. The Third Five Year Development Plan (TFYDP, 2000/01-2004/05) calls for a balanced transition to a market economy as a means for accelerating growth, generating new employment opportunities, and ensuring social justice. Summary of discussions. On the basis of the current oil price forecasts, Iran’s external position is expected to remain manageable for the medium term. The challenge is to generate sustained increase in growth without reigniting inflation or weakening the external position. The discussions focused on the strategy to expeditiously correct the underlying structural distortions and the official economic program for 2000/01, which calls for exchange rate unification by end-2000/01, trade liberalization, financial sector reforms, establishment of private-owned banks, and a tight monetary stance to reduce innation to 16 percent; a hard budget constraint on the state enterprises, and raising the budget surplus to about 3 percent of GDP. An Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) will be established effective 2001/02 to minimize the impact of oil price fluctuations. The St&urged the authorities to quickly correct critical prices, liberalize trade, sharply reduce implicit subsidies (particularly on petroleum products), establish a level playing field for the private sector, implement a clearly articulated strategy to restructure and privatize state enterprises along with the banking system, and establish an explicit social safety net to underpin these reforms. Fund technical assistance was also discussed. Staff appraisal. While the financial position is expected to remain comfortable, a bolder program, appropriately sequenced and implemented, would be needed to achieve the authorities’ growth and employment objectives.

BACKGROUNDANDRECENTDEVELOPMENTS~ 1. Reflecting the rapid population growth in the 198Os, about 60 percent of population is below the age of 25 years at present. Thus, for the next five years, the rate of growth of the labor force is projected to remain high at about 4 percent per year, which will put further pressure on the unemployment rate which now stands at about 13 percent. 2. Economic growth, which is highly sensitive to macroeconomic instability and domestic investment, has decelerated steadily over the past two decades and averaged about 3 percent over the past four years. A sustained acceleration of economic growth will be needed in the period ahead to make a dent in the level of unemployment. 3. The output and employment performance of the Iranian economy remains constrained by widespread structural rigidities.* With heavy dependence on volatile exports, administrative allocation of resources through an extensive network of public enterprises and state-owned financial institutions, an administratively mandated grid of financial rates of return and charges, heavily subsidized energy and petroleum products, multiple exchange rates, trade restrictions, and restrictive business practices have distorted price signals, generated large untargeted implicit subsidies, weakened incentives for non-oil exports, and discouraged the growth of the private sector.3 In the event, inflation has remained at a high level without generating sustained growth and new employment opportunities for a rapidly expanding labor force. At the same time, the external position has remained sensitive to oil price developments and exchange and trade restrictions have been used to address external shocks. Iran, however, has a tradition of budgetary prudence, and maintains a relatively small domestic and external debt. There has also been a significant improvement in Iran’s social indicators, particularly in the health and education areas (see Basic Data). Recognizing the adverse impact of the distortions, the authorities have initiated a major reform program to shift toward market-based resource allocation that is articulated in the TFYDP. ’ Iran’s relations with the Fund are described in Appendix I. Relations with the World Bank are summarized in Appendix II. Appendix III summarizes the statistical issues. ’ For a detailed assessment of the determinants of growth in Iran, see Islamic Republic of Iran, Recent Economic Developments and Selected Issues (forthcoming). 3 Competitiveness of the bulk of Iranian manufactured activities is crucially dependent upon the provision of cheap energy, which has militated against the meaning&l correction of petroleum product prices and has delayed needed restructuring.

In 1998/99,4 growth of real GDP fell to about 2 percent as investment/GDP stagnated and the unemployment rate remained high at an estimated 13 percent (Table 1, Chart 1). Inflation accelerated and the average cost of living index rose by 20 percent as compared with 17 percent in 1997/98. Reflecting the 35 percent drop in Iran’s oil export prices, the financial position weakened sharply. Despite a contraction of imports, the external current account shifted from a surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP in 1997198 to a deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP in 1998/99 (Tables 1 and 5). The authorities responded by drawing down official foreign reserves and bilaterally negotiating a rephasing of external debt service payments to four major creditor countries. Gross offtcial reserves fell to the equivalent of barely three months of imports. Although the Iranian rial was allowed to depreciate in the TSE market in response to demand pressures, the discount on the parallel market rose to about 40 percent by end-1998/99 (Chart 2). Despite a compression of capital outlays, the budget deficit increased threefold to almost 7 percent of GDP on account of lower oil revenues which was largely financed by the banking system (Tables 2 and 3, Chart 3). Reflecting a sharp increase in credit to the government and to the private sector toward the second half of the year, monetary expansion picked up to about 26 percent from 16 percent in the previous year (Table 4 and Chart 4). 5. Responding to the worsening economic conditions in 1998/99, the authorities in 1999/2000 formulated a medium-term reform strategy aimed at increasing growth and ensuring external stability through restoring market-based prices, reducing the role of the public sector, and encouraging private sector investment. Under this strategy, which has been incorporated in the TFYDP, important policy reforms were initiated in 1999/2000, including a 70 percent increase in petroleum product prices and the introduction of a more market-based TSE exchange rate. The economy received a major boost from the 77 percent increase in the average oil export price during the year, which resulted in a dramatic improvement in Iran’s financial position. 6. The budgetary situation improved in 1999/2000. With revenues rising primarily on account of higher oil revenues to 27 percent of GDP from 19 percent in 1998/99, and continued expenditure restraint, the budget shifted from a large deficit of about 7 percent of GDP to a surplus of about 1 percent of GDP in 1999/2000. Non-oil tax revenues also performed better than in the previous year; both direct and indirect tax revenues increased relative to GDP reflecting, in part, improved compliance. While a small amount of Government Participation Papers (GPPs) was issued to deepen the financial market, the government built up its deposits with the banking system by about 1.7 percent of GDP. Monetary expansion moderated in 1999/2000 to 20 percent as the growth of net domestic assets decelerated sharply to 16.9 percent of the initial stock of broad money 4 Fiscal year covers the period March 21-March 20. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- in response to a fall in net claims of the banking system on the government (Table 4 and Chart 4). Increase in credit to the state enterprise sector was restricted to only 3 percent of the initial stock of broad money while claims on the private sector registered a sharp increase, in part, on account of expanded credit to the agriculture and construction sectors. 7. The external position strengthened sharply. With higher oil export receipts and lower imports, the external current account is estimated to have shifted in 1999/2000 to a large surplus of about USS4.7 billion or the equivalent of about 4.7 percent of GDP (Table 5 and Chart 5). Non-oil exports also rose by almost 10 percent, in part, reflecting the 20 percent depreciation of the rial on the TSE market. Accelerated external debt service payments resulted in a drop in the outstanding external debt to about 10 percent of GDP and the debt service ratio to 20 percent (Table 6).’ The overall balance shifted from a deficit in 1998/99 to a large surplus of over US%2 billion with gross official reserves rising to US356 billion or the equivalent of about five months of imports. In the process, the external vulnerability indicators have improved (Table 7). 8. In an attempt to introduce market-based financial rates and to mop up excess liquidity that had emerged in the second half of 1998/99, a term deposit facility (the “open account”) at the Bank Markazi Iran (BMI, central bank) was activated for the commercial banks to deposit their excess reserves, initially at rates ranging between 14 percent and 18 percent for deposits of 3-12 months in maturity, pending the introduction of the Central Bank Participation Paper (CPPS).~ Moreover, bank accounting standards were assessed with a view to implementing a new bank accounting framework as a first step toward financial sector reforms.’ In order to increase competition, licenses for three private nonbank credit institutions were issued in 1999/2000, of which two such institutions commenced operation during the year. However, 5 Reflecting these developments and the improved external position, the export credit guarantee agencies of Iran’s major trading partners are reported to have agreed to upgrade its rating and restore their coverage. 6 The CPPs will be a central bank instrument for short-term management of banks’ liquidity and will conform to Islamic finance principles. This instrument is expected to be issued against a trust fund composed of minority shares in government partially owned companies that are listed on the TSE. The CPPs will be transacted on a market basis, including issuing them through auctions, and will incorporate liquidity features to facilitate secondary market dealing and open market operations. 7 The existing bank accounting framework in Iran does not capture the peculiarities of its Islamic banking characteristics. With Fund technical assistance, and in cooperation with the Bahrain-based Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), a comprehensive review of bank accounting practices was conducted in August 1999. The authorities are presently reviewing the AAOIFI accounting standards for their applicability to the banking system practiced in Iran.

Sectoral targets and loan-by- loan approval requirements were applied to regulate credit allocation, while reserve requirements (which are high and are differentiated by maturity of deposits) remained unchanged. In the absence of indirect instruments of monetary management, the authorities, as in the past, also used prior import deposit requirements to regulate credit. 9. These, and a wide range of other financial sector issues, were examined under the pilot Fund/Bank Financial Sector Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) in February-March 2000. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) derived from this exercise concluded that, partly reflecting its state ownership, administrative controls and limited interaction with international financial flows, the Iranian banking system is not particularly vulnerable to external shocks.’ However, banks are substantially undercapitalixed and-given the high rate of taxation along with fixed lending and deposit rates- relatively unprofitable (Box 1). Moreover, the policy framework has not permitted the development of an interbank money market. The undercapitalization of the banks, along with the distorted incentive structures arising out of the controlled structure of rates of return and charges, credit controls, and sectoral guidelines, have adversely impacted the ability of the banking system to effectively mobilize and allocate financial savings. Given the significant quasi-fiscal role that the financial system has undertaken, the current set up embodies a significant risk to the budget whenever state-owned financial institutions need to be supported. 10. Significant progress was made during 1999/2000 to liberalize the multiple exchange rate system (Box 2). The market-based TSE exchange rate, introduced in early 1999/2000, which now applies to almost all of the private sector foreign exchange transactions, depreciated by about 20 percent to Rls 8,146 = US$l in 1999/2000 and the differential with the parallel market shrank to less than 2 percent from 20 percent at the end of the year (Chart 1). In addition, one of the two official exchange rates-the “export” rate (Rls 3,000 = US$l)-was discontinued at end-l 999/2000, leaving only two formal rates-the “floating” rate (Rls 1,750 = US$l) and the TSE exchange rate-in operation. In view of the nominal depreciation of the rial in the latter market, given inflation differentials, the weighted average rate exhibited only a marginal real effective depreciation during 1999/2000; however, the rial depreciated by about 15 percent in real effective terms in the TSE market which contributed to the restoration of competitiveness. Further liberalization measures were taken in March 2000, involving the abolition of surrender requirements for non-oil export receipts to BMI. Banks have been permitted to purchase foreign exchange from both domestic and * For details, see “Islamic Republic of Iran: Financial Sector Stability Assessment,” forthcoming.

Progress on trade liberalization remained slow in 1999/2000. A “positive list” of 3 1 broad categories of goods continued to apply to imports at the TSE and the export rates and was used to support the appreciated official exchange rates. Although import duties range between 0 and 120 percent (many at specific levels), the effective average rate remained low owing to exemptions for the government agencies and some state enterprises. In line with the introduction of the TSE exchange rate, private sector imports at this rate ceased to be subject to foreign exchange allocation, BMI approval, or the opening of the letters of credit. However, they remained subject to licensing requirements. 12. Despite the strengthened external and fiscal positions, the supply response remained weak in 1999/2000. With the investment/GDP ratio declining slightly to 20 percent mainly on account of lower private sector investment (including of state enterprises), growth of real GDP (excluding terms of trade adjustment) registered only a marginal recovery to about 2.4 percent and was associated with small contractions in the oil and agricultural sectors (Chart 3). While the average inflation rate remained broadly unchanged at 20 percent, reflecting, in part, the large liquidity overhang at the end of 1998/99, monthly rates of inflation decelerated over the last half of the year.” Even though domestic petroleum product prices were raised by 70 percent, the staff estimates the implicit subsidy to have risen to the equivalent of almost 17 percent of GDP as compared with 7 percent in 1998/99.” ’ In the process, the differential treatment of “domestically” and the “externally” sourced foreign exchange holdings has been largely eliminated which will help convergence of the TSE and the parallel market rates. lo The consumer price index is reported to have fallen to about 13 percent on a year-on-year basis for the month ending on April 2 1, 2000. l1 The bulk of the increase in the petroleum product-related implicit subsidy was on account of the sharper increase in world oil prices than the increase in domestic prices and the depreciation of the rial in the TSE market which was used to convert world prices into rials for comparison purposes. Explicit budgetary subsidies for basic goods fell slightly to 1.7 percent of GDP on account of adjustments in administered prices and a drop in commodity coverage. Preliminary staff estimates indicate that implicit quasi-fiscal subsidies arising out of the lower financial rates and the use of overvalued “export” and “floating” exchange rates could be around 10 percent of GDP in 1999/2000.

In a departure from the previous two development plans which concentrated mainly on inward-looking growth through administrative allocation of resources by the public sector, the TFYDP aims at an orderly transition to a market economy as a means for accelerating growth and generating employment opportunities for the growing labor force, while according strong emphasis on social justice. The Plan’s quantitative objectives include an average real GDP growth rate of 6 percent and employment generation of 760,000 per year with the aim of reducing unemployment to about 11 percent at the end of the Plan period. Gross investment is envisaged to grow annually by 7.1 percent with private investment growing at 8.5 percent annually. 14. The policies which are to be implemented over the Plan period include: (a) structural reforms and privatization of the large state enterprise sector; (b) laws to demonopolize the economy and to promote private investment, both domestic and foreign; (c) trade liberalization; (d) development of the financial market with private sector participation in the banking sector to mobilize and allocate resources under market-determined rates of return and charges; and (e) decentralization of official economic decision making including autonomization of monetary policy. Macroeconomic policies underlying this strategy would aim at: (a) reducing inflation through avoidance of budgetary deficits; (b) broadening of the tax base, reform of the tax system, and the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT); (c) gradually liberalizing the financial rates of return and charges; (d) unifying exchange rates at a market-determined level; and (e) establishing a special OSF to accumulate oil export receipts exceeding the level envisaged in the Plan to stabilize revenue and expenditures, thus cushioning the economy from unanticipated external shocks. The approved Plan, however, sets an annual ceiling of 10 percent on price increases on goods and services provided by the government (including petroleum products), indexes public sector wage increases to the rate of inflation, and does not include targeted subsidies.12 15. The offtcial economic program for 2000/01 is aimed at pursuing prudent demand management to curb inflation and to consolidate the external position. Additional measures are planned to liberalize the exchange and trade system, introduce greater market orientation to the banking sector, and encourage private sector investment (Box 3). However, growth of real GDP is officially projected to recover modestly to 3.4 percent mainly on account of the easing of supply constraints including through higher imports, while the agricultural sector is projected to stagnate owing to the continued drought conditions. l2 A higher than 10 percent increase will require specific parliamentary approval.

The new parliament with a strong pro-reformist majority was inaugurated in May 2000. It is expected to focus on socio-political reforms and is likely to speed up the passage of a number of pending legislations aimed at encouraging private sector and foreign direct investment. 17. The policy discussions focused on the authorities’ broad reform strategy and notably on the pace of implementation. While the authorities recognize that wide-ranging reforms are needed and are encompassed by the TFYDP, they are of the view that these measures should be implemented at a pace that is consistent with the maintenance of durable external stability, an orderly reduction in inflation, political acceptability, and Iran’s administrative capacity. A. Structural Reforms Exchange rate and exchange system 18. The authorities said that they intend to unify the remaining two formal exchange rates (the offGzia1 “floating rate” and the TSE rate) by end 2000/01 and allow the unified rate to be market-determined, within an integrated exchange market (Box 1). As a first step toward unification, in conjunction with the elimination of the export rate, the market in import certificates has been replaced by a transitional market in foreign exchange certificates of deposit in the TSE.i3 During 2000/01, the authorities intend to: l Allow the TSE rate to continue to be determined by market forces with all importers holding valid licenses having unrestricted access to foreign exchange in the TSE market. The authorities confirmed that there was no binding exchange rate band in place within which they targeted the TSE rate through market intervention. Short-term movements in the TSE rate are smoothed around a path broadly reflecting inflation differentials, but this path would be adjusted in the event of exogenous or policy shocks including the fall in world oil prices or trade liberalization (see below). This practice will be continued during 2000/O 1. l Increase the share of all current account transactions at the TSE rate to 60 percent from 33 percent in 1999/2000. As increasing amounts of transactions are shifted to the TSE market, the monetary authorities will not influence banks’ decisions with regard to the allocation of foreign exchange among licensed imports. The “floating rate” (Rls 1,750 = USSl) would remain primarily an accounting rate for budgetary purposes. l3 This development signals a move toward a market in foreign exchange per se rather than a market in foreign exchange repurchase rights coupled with import rights.

The mission called upon the authorities to initiate the sale of regular preannounced “baseload” of oil and gas export receipts on regular intervals rather than undertake daily sales on an ad hoc basis. Beyond these sales, BMI should only conduct foreign exchange intervention to smooth out sharp temporary fluctuations around the trend rate in the TSE market. Such an operation will strengthen market confidence in the predictability of foreign exchange supply and will, by requiring banks to take positions, allow the development of the interbank market to replace the TSE market. This is critical to an orderly operation of the unified rate in the period ahead. The authorities responded that they would explore this option in the context of future sales of foreign exchange on behalf of the government. 20. The Iranian representatives indicated that they were committed to eliminating advance import deposit requirements as soon as alternative instruments for credit management become available. In a step toward their elimination, such deposit requirements will soon be reduced. The mission stressed the need to expeditiously introduce the CPPs and, in the interim, reactivate the open accounts in order to eliminate the need for maintaining such deposit requirements. In addition, the mission felt that the current trade financing arrangement should be phased out through which the BMI provides both credit risk and exchange risk guarantees. Trade system and policies 21. The TFYDP stipulates the removal of all nontariff barriers and reduction of tariffs during the Plan period, while avoiding output shocks and inflationary pressures. Following the liberalization of the exchange system, and increased market orientation of the exchange rate, the authorities have initiated steps in 2000/01 to relax import restrictions. l The positive import list has been enlarged to cover 41 broad categories from 31 in 1999/2000 and a further expansion of this list will be pursued as a step toward an early introduction of a small “negative” import list. Concurrently, the authorities intend to proceed, with Fund technical assistance, on the tariffication of quantitative restrictions so as to introduce a market-based trade policy. The government also intends to rationalize the tariff structure over the next one to two years by consolidating all trade-related taxes, lowering the level of tariff rates, and reducing the number of tariff bands. The mission urged the authorities to introduce a small negative list and open general licensing without delay. In addition, the customs valuation rate should be shifted from the current floating rate to the TSE rate in conjunction with tariff reforms. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- l In order to streamline the licensing procedures and minimize bureaucratic delays, the role of ministries other than the Ministry of Commerce has been sharply curtailed in the import approval process; export licensing for all commodities (other than three categories including subsidized commodities) has been discontinued; and the list of goods, which could be imported by exporters’ own foreign exchange has been expanded. In addition, transparency of the regulatory framework has been enhanced. l As approved by the TPYDP, all customs duty exemptions, discounts, and preferences for government agencies, state enterprises, and foundations are being withdrawn. 22. The mission stressed that an early and comprehensive trade liberalization combined with demonopolization was critical for the market signals to efficiently allocate resources and to promote private sector investment. The authorities agreed with the mission that henceforth exchange and trade policies should be de-linked and that trade policy could not be used in the future to address any pressures on the exchange rate in the market. Rates of return 23. The Iranian representatives confirmed that the authorities were planning to improve the flexibility of rates of return and their responsiveness to market forces thus deepening the financial markets. Banks will be allowed to issue certificates of deposit (CDs) with market-based rates of return, and to on-lend the mobilized resources on market-based terms. At the same time, new private banks will be allowed to freely set rates and allocate credit (see below). Also, as part of the medium-term plan to liberalixe credit allocation, banks will be granted complete freedom in 2000/01 in determining the terms of 20 percent of their total private sector lending (on top of the resources mobilixed through the CDs). The remaining private sector credit will continue to be subject to sectoral lending guidelines and the associated rates schedule. Moreover, the authorities have decided to allow the CPPs, once issued, to be auctioned and traded freely, and serve as an instrument for open market operations. The mission invited the authorities to move expeditiously to provide greater market sensitivity to the rates structure, in part, through a faster liberalization of credit allocation, and controls on rates of return/charges, accelerated removal of specified credit facilities, and reactivation of the open accounts at the Bank Markazi pending the introduction of CPPs. In addition, the mission called for reserve requirement averaging and to begin unifying and reducing these requirements. It also stressed the importance of enhancing the monetary authorities’ ability to manage liquidity through market operations, based on a more flexible rate structure, for facilitating an orderly transition to a fully market-based exchange system. l4 l4 Moreover, uniform bands for lending and deposit rates could be established at rates that are consistent with macroeconomic policy objectives and are positive in real terms.

The increase in domestic petroleum product prices had been limited by parliament to 10 percent for 2000/01 which, given the rate of inflation, implied a fall in real prices over 1999/2000. Moreover, given current world market prices, staff estimates indicated that, despite domestic price adjustments, implicit subsidies on petroleum products would remain at about 17 percent of GDP. The Iranian representatives recognized the high opportunity cost of such subsidies and expected to revisit this issue with the new parliament. The mission encouraged the authorities to accelerate the pace of price adjustment so as to establish parity with world prices over the Plan period. In order to ensure success of such a policy, it should be supported by a well-targeted social safety net financed by higher petroleum product price-related revenue windfall which would minimize the increase in costs to vulnerable groups and allow an orderly adjustment of the producing sector without abrupt increases in output prices or loss in output and employment.15 The mission stressed that, in the process, implicit subsidies should be made explicit which should decline at a well- defined and preannounced pace over the Plan period as state enterprises improve efficiency and adjust their product prices under a more competitive market environment. Such subsidies should be transparently channeled so as to avoid governance problems. 25. Implicit subsidies associated with the administratively mandated financial rates and the multiple exchange rate system would decline in the period ahead, in line with exchange rate and financial rate corrections and the fall in inflation. At the same time, the authorities intend to contain other subsidies by limiting the number of commodity categories besides energy and utilities that are subject to administrative prices. These cover basic foods, medicines, and certain goods and services produced by state monopolies. Subsidies provided through administered prices of basic foods will fall slightly to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2000/01. I5 Given the relatively small share of energy in the consumer price index basket (1.9 percent), the inflationary impact of the increase in domestic petroleum product prices is estimated to be relatively small. An extensive World Bank study (Economic Aspects of Increasing Energy Prices to Border Price Levels in the Islamic Republic of Iran--#19803 IRN, August 2, 1999) concludes that a 2.5 times increase in such prices-that would have achieved parity with border prices in mid-1999-would have added 13 percent to the price level. If phased over a three-year period, such price increases would have resulted in three successive 4 percentage point increases in the general price level, Without appropriately targeted subsidies, such a price correction would have been strongly regressive with a larger burden on the rural sector. The cost of private sector investment would have increased by around 11 percent, with higher cost effects on the nontradable sector than on the tradable sector.

In order to foster increased competition in the financial sector, the government has been authorized by parliament to establish privately owned banks; so far such operations were permitted only in the “free zones.9’16 It is expected that, with Fund technical assistance, one or two private banks will be licensed in 2000/01. These banks will operate without official guidelines on credit allocation and will not be subject to the officially mandated grid of the financial rates of return and charges. The Iranian representatives noted that although state-owned banks are presently not to be privatized, the government intends to accord them increased autonomy with respect to resource mobilization and credit allocation so that they could compete with the planned private banks. As reflected in the Fund/Bank FSAP report (see Box 3), the mission stressed the need to support liberalization of rates of return and credit allocation by state-owned banks through: l Implementing an action plan for improving commercially oriented governance and management of state-owned banks in order to promote active but prudent competitive behavior. l Completing an independent assessment of the adequacy of asset classification and provisioning at banks, and recapitalizing banks accordingly to international standards. l Developing strengthened prudential supervision and regulation of banks and nonbank financial institutions, including revised bank accounting rules and standards, and strengthened prudential reporting and monitoring. The mission also called for improving risk management processes and their oversight, in line with the development of new market-based monetary policy methods and instruments consistent with the national legal system. Upgrading the capacity of both banks and the bank supervisors in such areas will be a substantial task. l Taking steps to develop the rial interbank market in line with the establishment of private banks and new liquidity management instruments. l6 Excluding the recently licensed nonbank financial institutions. The decision to license new private banks (in addition to private nonbank financial institutions) followed a recent constitutional interpretation that, contrary to previous expectation, partial privatization of state-owned banks would not be permissible, but entry of new private banks would be acceptable. The authorities see the expected increase in competition at the margin from a small number of private banks as a desirable means of encouraging the large state-owned banks to improve their own competitive performance and gear up for their own liberalization. The method of introducing competition will bring forward the need for a carefully designed bank licensing policy and significantly improved bank supervision.

The restructuring and reform of the large state enterprise sector would be undertaken through a three-pronged strategy, precise modalities of which were being formulated. Specifically: l Some 700 state enterprises will be privatixed over the TFYDP period either through direct sales or through the TSE. The budget for 2001/02 includes privatization proceeds of Rls 500 billion (about 0.1 percent of GDP). In the short run, the focus will be on improving the efficiency of state enterprises through a hard budget constraint strictly enforced through lower limits on access to bank credit. No new credit will be allowed unless any outstanding debt arrears have been cleared. The budget allocation for state enterprises will be restricted to Rls 7 trillion, part of which will be for capital loss compensation. The mission stressed the importance of avoiding the buildup of inter-enterprise arrears in response to the hard budget constraint. Implementation of an appropriately crafted explicit safety net, combined with the orderly correction of output prices and effective state enterprise monitoring would be helpful in this regard. l All special preferences, exemptions from taxes and commercial duties, and exchange allocation at an overvalued exchange rate to state enterprises as well as private “foundations” (Bonyads) in order to ensure equal treatment with the private sector will be eliminated.” l Laws will be implemented for the removal of monopoly status for state enterprises in broad areas other than for natural monopolies as specified by the constitution, supported by anti-trust regulations and clarification of the law for the protection and encouragement of foreign direct investment. In this regard, rationalization of labor laws with the aim of according investors greater freedom in the choice of appropriate technologies would be highly crucial. 28. In the fiscal area, in order to simplify the revenue structure and to enhance the buoyancy and elasticity of the tax system, the government has been, with Fund technical assistance, developing the foundations for the value-added tax (VAT). In this regard, staffing and training for the implementation of the VAT has begun with progress being made in the preparation of the large taxpayer’s register. The VAT is expected to be in full operation by 2003/04. In concert, the authorities expect to rationalize the indirect tax system by replacing the plethora of specific sales taxes and other levies with the introduction of the VAT and simplify the customs tariff system. The mission encouraged the authorities to review the income tax system with a view to reducing the top marginal rates. In order to more efficiently utilize the current oil revenue windfall and to ensure stability in government outlays, an OSF (Box 5) will be established effective 2001/02 and will accumulate oil receipts exceeding the r’ See Box 4 for a brief description of the largest private sector foundation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. - 19- level envisaged for the TFYDP period. The mission suggested to the authorities to fully integrate the operations of the OSF with those of the budget in order to avoid any extrabudgetary spending not authorized by parliament. B. Demand Management 29. The authorities indicated that financial policies during 2000/01 will aim at containing the growth of domestic liquidity so as to reduce inflation, support the exchange reforms, and ensure a buildup of gross official reserves. The planned reduction in inflation should also facilitate progress toward positive real rates of return. Fiscal policy 30. The primary element of demand management would be a cautious fiscal policy despite a significant increase in oil and gas revenues. The budget for 2000/01 projects total revenues to increase by almost 3 percentage points of GDP to about 30 percent of GDP as the budgeted oil and gas revenues are targeted to increase to about 16 percent of GDP.‘* Non-oil revenues are budgeted to decline to about 13.3 percent of GDP from 14.6 percent of GDP in 1999/2000 on account of lower nontax revenues, reflecting primarily the lower profit transfers of some large state enterprises (Table 3). Budgetary expenditures, mainly current outlays, on the other hand, are targeted to increase by 18 percent over the previous year’s provisional outlays, reflecting a slight increase in terms of GDP to 26 percent of GDP. However, total expenditure in real terms is budgeted to remain at about the same level as in 1996/97. The 2000/01 budget also provides for nonrecurrent “contingency” expenditures amounting to Rls 11.1 trillion (about 2 percent of GDP) in the event that Iran’s crude oil prices exceeded US$15.75 per barrel, which-barring unforeseen developments-is highly likely. lg Including such contingency expenditures, the budget would register an overall surplus of close to 3 percent of GDP as compared with a surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 1999/2000 and a deficit of almost 7 percent of GDP in 1998/99. This surplus would be retained for transfer to the OSF at the end of the fiscal year.20 The corresponding buildup of government i8 The upward revision in the WE0 oil price baseline as of May 16, 2000 implies an additional export receipt of US$1.6 billion and revenues equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP. lg The contingency expenditures include a one-time subsidy of Rls 3 trillion to importers who no longer have access to foreign exchange at the abolished “export” exchange rate, a transfer of Rls 5 trillion to commercial banks which they can on-lend to state-owned enterprises, about Rls 3 trillion in accelerated debt repayments, and Rls 1.5 trillion of one-time bonus payments to retiring government employees. 2o Effective 2001/02, the operation of the OSF will be based on a price-contingent rule, implying that all oil revenues over and above a cutoff price (presently US$15.75 per barrel) _ (continued.. .)

The authorities view the planned buildup of budgetary surplus as a primary instrument of demand management and external viability. 31. Reviewing the fiscal strategy, the mission stressed the need to take this opportunity to improve the quality of government outlays and shift the composition of government expenditures toward capital outlays, which had been squeezed over the past three years on account of lower oil revenues. Given the temporary nature of the increase in oil prices and to reduce dependence on the fluctuating oil revenues, the mission encouraged the authorities to progress expeditiously to establish a stable and buoyant non-oil revenue base. In particular, the mission urged the authorities to quickly reduce implicit subsidies through significantly higher domestic prices of petroleum products. This step would also generate the much-needed fiscal resources to undertake structural reforms of the state enterprises and higher capital outlays; targeted subsidies could be used to minimize the adverse price effects. Alternatively, the authorities could consider specific excise duties to reduce implicit subsidies, which could also facilitate a redirection of resource allocation to more efficient activities. The mission also encouraged the authorities to improve expenditure management Monetary policy 32. The authorities stated that the growth of broad money would be restricted to 16.4 percent in 2000/01 in order to reduce inflation to an annual average rate of 16 percent from 20 percent in 1999/2000. For this purpose, given that net foreign assets are projected to increase, the growth of the banking system’s NDA will be limited to 13.5 percent of the initial stock of money as against 17 percent in 1999/2000. With the banking sector’s net claims on the government falling, the authorities’ monetary program allows for credit to the private sector to increase by 21 percent of broad money or at about the same rate as in 1999/2000, implying an increase in such credit in real terms. On the other hand, credit growth to public enterprises will be restricted to only 2.4 percent of the stock of broad money or less than in 1999/2000. The official monetary program requires the state enterprises to adhere to a hard budget constraint, improve efficiency, and adjust their prices if necessary. will be transferred to the OSF to be used for specified purposes including certain expenditures and the smoothing out of fluctuations in oil revenues.

Reflecting the increase in oil export receipts and the restrained financial policies, the current external account is projected by the authorities to register a surplus of almost US%5 billion or about 6 percent of GDP in 2000/01, despite a 22 percent increase in imports. Non-oil exports are also expected to register a 15 percent expansion on account of a more realistic TSE exchange rate and the buoyant global economy. On the other hand, the capital and financial account is projected to register a deficit of about US$l.5 billion on account of the repayment of the rescheduled debt. It is expected that, reflecting an early settlement of rephased external debt and the improvement in credit ratings by the Export Credit Guarantee Agencies, there will be an increase in bilateral medium-term project financing. In the process, the overall balance will register a surplus in excess of US$3 billion and an increase in gross official reserves to almost US$9 billion, or the equivalent of more than six months of 2000/01 imports. 34. The Iranian representatives reaffbmed their commitment to strengthen their debt management in order to maintain an excellent debt-servicing record in the period ahead. The external debt is expected to decline further in 2000/01 to about 10 percent of GDP with the short-term debt stock falling to about 40 percent of gross official reserves from about 80 percent in 1999/2000 (Table 6). The authorities intend to further improve the maturity structure of the official and officially guaranteed external debt by contracting new debt on medium- and long-term maturities. Given the low level of external indebtedness and the strengthened external position, the authorities also indicated their intention to explore prospects for mobilizing external financing in the global capital markets. Presently, they are negotiating with two French and German banks to lead manage a sovereign debt Eurobond issue of US$300-500 million; placements will be mainly in Europe and the Far East. The government also intends to remove impediments in the way of foreign direct investment (FDI), open more areas for F’DI, and establish equal treatment with domestic investment. It is expected that new legislation will be introduced soon to simplify and clarify the existing Law for the Encouragement and Protection of Foreign Investment.21 III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK 35. The medium-term outlook is highly sensitive to variations in the global oil prices, the ability of the government to adjust domestic prices of petroleum products and redirect implicit subsidies to productive investment, the pace of demonopolization and trade liberalization 21 Iran has successfully utilized the “buyback” and Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) mechanisms to promote foreign investment in the oil and gas sector and has started to extend it to the non- oil sector. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - which will determine the path and magnitude of private sector investment, and the speed of the planned structural reforms and privatization of the financial and state enterprise sectors. Although the TFYDP provides a general vision of how such reforms will take place, a clearly defined path is still evolving. Given the slower pace of adjustment in administered prices and the implied constraint on external financing, the needed resources will not be available to achieve the Plan’s growth and employment targets. Steps also remain to be specified to ensure the desired increase in private sector investment and to define the pace and sequencing of structural reforms and privatization. In particular, the planned slow pace of reduction in implicit subsidies will militate against an efficient allocation of resources and an early reduction in dependence on the oil sector which could leave the economy vulnerable to exogenous shocks. The authorities noted that, while the TFYDP provided the basic framework, annual development programs would provide an opportunity to strengthen the policy effort. However, such effort will have to be consistent with the government’s administrative capacity, political acceptability, and the underlying objective of social justice. 36. The mission felt that a strategy which incorporated a 60 percent annual increase in petroleum product prices over the next four years (2001/02-2004/05), a market-determined exchange rate, larger access to external financing including FDI, and improved market conditions for private sector investment, would permit a sharper increase in growth (7 percent) than envisaged by the TFYDP toward the last two years of the Plan period without weakening the external position. Under this scenario, growth would be slower in the first two years (averaging 3 percent) on account of initial contractionary impact of faster structural reforms, and inflation higher (16 percent) on account of the faster petroleum product price adjustments and a faster rate of adjustment in output prices. However, unless there was a strong political consensus, it would be difficult to implement the needed price adjustments and address the likely short-term increase in unemployment. A more comprehensive social safety net, including public works programs to provide employment opportunities to laid off workers, would be needed to sustain such an effort which might entail excessive pressure on the existing administrative capacity. 37. A less ambitious medium-term scenario was prepared, which was broadly consistent with the strategy underlying the TFYDP in order to highlight areas where additional steps may be needed to achieve the authorities’ objectives. Underlying assumptions included WE0 oil price outlook, domestic petroleum product price adjustments of 30 percent per annum as was envisaged under the draft TFYDP, slower structural adjustment of state enterprises as permitted by the generation of additional revenues associated with petroleum product price corrections, and an explicitly targeted social safety net financed by the reduction of implicit subsidies (Tables 1-6).22 The scenario assumes the maintenance of tight demand management 22 The 30 percent petroleum product price adjustment is estimated to result in a 1.2 percentage point increase in the cost of living per annum. Under such price assumptions, the implicit petroleum product subsidy would decline gradually to less than 10 percent of GDI) (continued. . . ) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - through a steady decline in money growth to 13 percent in 2004/05 with inflation falling to less than 9 percent by the end of the forecast period, and a hard budget constraint on the state enterprises. The budget is projected to register a surplus rising Corn 0.4 percent of GDP in 2001/02 to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2004/05, which would partly finance higher private sector investment. A unified market-determined exchange rate is assumed to be in operation throughout the forecast period. Based on the official program, market determination of the rates of return and charges would be gradually achieved through the expansion of the deregulated credit component at the rate of 20 percent per year. 38. Under these assumptions, the balance of payments position is projected to remain comfortable despite the expected reduction in the global oil prices from their peak levels in 2000/01. Imports are projected to grow at about 10 percent per year to sustain higher levels of investment and the external current account would turn to a deficit equal to almost 4 percent of GDP in 2004/05, financed in large part by capital inflows, mainly through foreign direct investment. However, under this scenario, gross official reserves are likely to remain comfortable but fall below the equivalent of six months of imports by the end of the forecast period. The debt/GDP ratio would register only a modest increase to about 13 percent and the debt service ratio would remain low at an average of about 7 percent. The authorities could seek additional external financing to avoid any drop in reserves and to finance higher level of investment. Although total investment would rise steadily to 28 percent of GDP, the growth of real GDP is projected to rise only gradually to an average of 5 percent in the last two years of the forecast period, as it will remain constrained by a slow pace of structural reforms and price corrections. Such a growth path would not be Mly consistent with the authorities’ employment objectives. IV. STATISTICALANDTECHNICALASSISTANCELWJES 39. Information provided to the Fund is generally adequate for an assessment of economic developments and to determine the country’s medium-term outlook and vulnerabilities. In addition to the improvement in the currentness of data reporting, the authorities have taken a number of steps during 1999/2000, supported by Fund technical assistance, to improve the quality and accuracy of the database. In particular, the authorities have: l established links between the balance of payments and external debt data; l developed capability for compilation and publication of quarterly balance of payments data; and by the end of the forecast period. Annual price increase of 30 percent would require at least ten years to achieve parity with global prices.

Fund technical assistance has been used to prepare fiscal data consistent with the revised Government Finance StatisticsManual so as to improve its usef%lness in the implementation and monitoring of fiscal policy, and to develop quarterly national account statistics. In addition, such assistance has helped reform the exchange system and establishment of the market-based exchange rate in the TSE market. Extensive technical assistance continues to be provided for improving tax administration and laying a foundation for the introduction of the VAT. The joint Fund/Bank FSAP has been an important vehicle to develop a program for wide-ranging financial sector reforms which will define the nature and extent of technical assistance requirements in the period ahead. However, there is a need to strengthen data generation in a number of important areas including on implicit and explicit subsidies, quasi-fiscal operations, the performance of state enterprises, and operations of the private sector foundations. The national accounts would also benefit from an expanded coverage of economic activities of important sectors of the Iranian economy. Moreover, the analysis of the budget continues to be hampered by incomplete coverage, insufficient disaggregation, and the lack of expenditure data by economic classification. There is also a need to improve the quality of prudential information on the financial system. 41. The implementation of Fund’s technical assistance recommendations has improved over the past one year, particularly in the area of exchange rate and exchange system reform and improvement in the database. In 2000/01, such assistance would be particularly beneficial in the areas of data improvement including national accounts, banking system reforms, including strengthening of bank supervision and establishment of new private banks, introduction of the CPPs, completion of exchange reforms, tariffication of quantitative import restrictions in conjunction with the introduction of a small “negative” import list, establishment of infrastructure for the implementation of the VAT, and targeted training in financial programming (Box 6). Additional assistance would be required, perhaps fi-om the World Bank, to establish a sound timetable for the structural reform of the state enterprise sector, restructuring of state-owned banks, assessment of expenditure policy, development of an effective petroleum product pricing policy, and a social safety net. V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 42. During 1999/2000, the Iranian authorities made significant progress in liberalixing the exchange system, raising domestic prices of petroleum products, and initiating steps to reform the financial sector. Moreover, the recovery in oil export prices brought about a dramatic improvement in Iran’s external position.

However, inflation remained at around 20 percent, growth was subdued, and unemployment remained high at about 13 percent. Despite price corrections, implicit subsidies provided by low petroleum product prices alone stood at about 17 percent of GDP. 43. The staff welcomes the planned prudent demand management in 2000/O 1, which is necessary to bring Iran to a lower inflation path and to help stabilize the liberalized exchange market, thus ensuring uninterrupted reforms. It is critical that, notwithstanding the developments in the global oil prices, the objective of effecting the targeted fiscal surplus should be adhered to. The staff encourages the authorities to expeditiously implement, with Fund technical assistance, rationalization of the non-oil tax system so as to facilitate an increase in non-oil revenues. Given the drop in real government investment in the past few years, and to support infrastructural development, the staff encourages a shift in expenditures toward capital outlays. The increased independence of monetary policy and a determined adherence to the targeted restraint on credit expansion should reinforce the fiscal stance. The staff endorses the authorities’ decision to eschew monetary financing in the event of a drop in oil revenues. In the event of a drop in such revenues, expenditures should be scaled back in order to protect the underlying monetary program. 44. On the basis of the present global oil price outlook, Iran’s external position is expected to remain manageable for the medium term. The challenge will be to accelerate growth in a sustained fashion without reigniting inflation or weakening the external position. This will call for a speedy correction of the underlying structural distortions. The TFYDP calls for accelerating private investment to speed up growth by increasing the role of market forces, including trade liberalization, restructuring and reducing the role of the public sector through privatization, enhancing of competition in the banking sector, and restoring market-based exchange and financial rates. However, a concrete strategy to implement the Plan is still evolving. Moreover, the Plan has set a slow pace of reduction in implicit subsidies which will be inimical to containing inflation, proper investment decisions, faster growth, and reduction in unemployment. The scenario approximating the TFYDP assumptions would imply relatively slow economic growth which would not be sufficient to fully address the emerging unemployment problem. Moreover, the incremental approach underlying the Plan may be too slow to take advantage of the current window of opportunity on the external front to shift the economy to a higher growth path. 45. The staff believes that the needed increase in private investment and a sustained positive supply response will call for a more sequenced and bolder reform effort. In particular, an expeditious correction of critical prices including the financial rates, reduction of implicit subsidies on petroleum products, and the establishment of a level playing field for the private sector would facilitate the much needed reallocation of resources. It is also important that a clearly articulated strategy to restructure and privatize state enterprises along with the banking system be implemented quickly. An explicit social safety net to facilitate an orderly adjustment to price and output shocks would provide the much needed underpinning for these reforms. Implementation of such a strategy will call for intensified coordination among the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-26 - authorities to ensure steadfast commitment and an effective simultaneous implementation of a number of policy measures. Progress toward comprehensive reform will be facilitated by the high level of Iran’s social indicators. 46. The authorities should be commended for facilitating the market-based determination of the TSE exchange rate, elimination of the export rate, and their intention to unify the two remaining rates, as planned, and to eliminate the advance import deposit requirement by end-2000/01. An orderly planned transition to the unified rate will require the establishment of a well-functioning interbank market in foreign exchange combined with the sale of a preannounced “baseload” of oil export receipts in the market. A relatively flexible exchange rate regime driven by market forces will allow maintenance of competitiveness and encourage non-oil exports, obviate the need for exchange and trade restrictions for balance of payments purposes, and mitigate any pressures arising out of economic restructuring and external shocks, It is critical that trade liberalization should proceed in concert with exchange reforms. The sta.fT encourages the authorities to accelerate their pace of import liberalization by quickly moving to a small negative import list, replacing quantitative restrictions with an appropriately structured import tariff system, and ensuring that the trade liberalization process is not reversed to defend the exchange rate. It is also important that such import liberalization strategy be clearly spelled out and made public. In view of the strengthened balance of payments position, the approval of the exchange restrictions arising out of the maintenance of multiple currency practices and the advance import deposit requirement is not recommended. 47. Administratively mandated financial rates have contributed to financial repression and disintermediation. Plans to lower credit allocation to state enterprises as a means for enforcing a hard budget constraint, steps toward phasing out guidelines for credit allocation, introduction of the market-based CDs, and the planned establishment of private banks should facilitate the emergence of positive real rates of return. However, bolder action is needed to correct distortions arising from directed credit allocation and to provide the needed incentives for banks to set their own rates of return based on market signals. This could include a unified rates schedule for credit to all sectors, which would help in discontinuing the specification of bank deposit rates, allow banks to compete for deposits on the basis of their profitability, and promote the development of the interbank money market. It is critical that the planned CPPs be developed as soon as possible to manage domestic liquidity, which will also facilitate an orderly foreign exchange market. In the meanwhile, the open account facility should be used to address development of any excess liquidity. 48. After making a commendable start in 1999/2000 on reducing implicit subsidies by raising domestic petroleum product prices, the authorities in 2000/01 failed to maintain the momentum. It is critical that the needed political consensus is developed quickly so that an appropriately designed energy pricing and subsidization policy can be implemented expeditiously. The staff would recommend adoption of a timetable to allow parity of domestic prices with world prices by the end of the Plan period. The authorities could consider introducing specific excise duties to target the needed reduction in implicit - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - subsidies to specific sectors and products. Consideration should also be given to reducing the number of basic commodities that benefit from budgetary subsidies and those that are subject to price controls. Moreover, work on a well-defined social security system should proceed apace so that consumer subsidies can be appropriately targeted at a time when important further adjustments in administered prices are to take place. 49. In order to benefit from the rationalized price system, an early reform of the banking and state enterprise sectors will be crucial. The staff encourages the authorities to move quickly to establish private banks, to build up state-owned banks’ capital base, and rationalize taxation to improve their profitability. In addition, in line with the recommendations of the FSAP mission, there is a need for: (a) more clearly defined roles and responsibilities for market participants and regulations, including increased autonomy (and accountability) for BMI in both its supervisory and monetary policy roles; (b) a more active and equitable competition between state-owned banks, between such banks and private banks, and between banks and nonbank financial institutions and markets; and (c) a greater awareness of risk and the incentive to monitor and manage it prudently within a competitive environment. It is expected that the planned reform of the banking sector will de-link it from any quasi-fiscal subsidization of state enterprises and also progressively reduce implicit subsidies through the nonmarket-based structure of financial rates. Implementation of such reforms will require careful attention to the sequencing issues, including the need for bank and state enterprise restructuring to move in parallel, given the significant concentration of bank lending to the large state enterprise sector. It is vital that the key measures be decided and implementation begun, with Fund technical assistance, quickly and determinedly. 50. The staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to privatize state enterprises during the TFYDP period. However, the enterprises should be restructured in line with the rationalized price system and the planned financial sector reforms. A timely implementation of a comprehensive action plan, with technical support from the World Bank, to restructure and privatize such enterprises according to a well-defined timetable will be crucial to the overall reform process. In this context, the planned hard budget constraint, including adherence to limits on credit allocation, should be enforced on these enterprises as they adjust to higher input prices while explicit subsidies allow them to undertake desired adjustments. The staff also strongly urges early concrete steps to promote private sector investment, including by establishing an appropriate regulatory framework, ensuring legal safeguards, and reducing the monopoly power of state enterprises. 51. At 10 percent of GDP, Iran’s outstanding external debt is about one fourth of the average debt/GDP ratio of oil-exporting countries and its debt service ratio is expected to fall over the next four years to 5 percent from the estimated 14 percent in 2000/01. Substantially expanded access to the global capital market will require accelerated reforms toward a market-based economy and sustained prudent macroeconomic management. It is crucial, however, that additional financing should be on medium- and long-term maturities and, preferably, in the form of FDI. The staff encourages the authorities to implement a foreign Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - direct investment law in 2000/O 1 which should establish equal treatment with domestic investors, open up a larger number of areas to foreign investment, and allow unrestricted repatriation of capital and investment income. 52. Important progress has been made to improve Iran’s statistical base. However, additional steps are needed to further strengthen it, improve transparency of information on government operations, state enterprises, provide more data on the role of the private sector foundations in the economy, and upgrade data on the prudential conditions of banks. Fund technical assistance would be particularly beneficial to facilitate unification of the exchange rate, development of a direct interbank foreign exchange market, tarEcation of nontariff barriers and tariff restructuring, structural reforms of the banking system, development of indirect instruments of monetary management, tax reforms, and training. 53. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Iran be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Islamic Republic of Iran: Financial Sector Stability Assessment Iran was one of the initial 12 countries that volunteered to participate in the pilot program for the Joint Fund5ank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The assessment mission took place in February- March 2000. Compared to other pilot program countries, Iran’s financial system has two main distinguishing features. First, the system is largely state-owned (as are many of the major borrowers), and, in general, subject to tight controls. Second, the system is subject to Islamic finance principles. The Iranian financial system is now entering a challenging time of change, with the Third Five Year Development Plan envisaging a move to a more liberalized and market-oriented form of Islamic banking. The process of exchange market liberahzation and exchange rate unification is already underway. The development of market-based instruments to improve bank liquidity management and the effectiveness of monetary policy has also begun. A move toward market-determined rates of return aud credit allocation is envisaged. At the same time, competition is to be introduced through the licensing of private banks. In addition, a few small near- bank institutions have recently been licensed, while a range of investment companies has already sprung up and grown significantly. The tinancial system is not currently well prepared for shift to a more open and competitive environment. The authorities recognize tbat significant additional structural, institutional and regulatory changes in the financial system are needed to support the intended moves toward liberalization. The FSAP report highlighted the following areas: l Bank competition, autonomy, and recapitalization: Main aspects include the development of licensing policy and criteria for new private banks; phased liberalization of direct moneGuy controls over existing state- owned banks; strengthening of commercial autonomy, accountability and governance of those banks, including clear targets for upgrading capacity in areas such as risk management, alongside their recapitalization to at least Basle minimum adequacy star&u&. l Supervision and regulation of banks and near-banks: Adoption of strengthened bank accounting and disclosure rules, in line with international practices, and upgrading of bank reporting for supervisory purposes; upgrading of prudential standards and regulations, bearing in mind Islamic finance modalities; substantial reorientation of supervision approach towards oversight of banks’ risk management, and associated upgrading of supervisory expertise. l Nonbank regulation and development: New legislation to regulate issuance of listed and unlisted securities, and establishment of an autonomous securities commission; new legislation or regulations for establishment of pension funds; liberalization of direct controls over insurance companies coupled with an upgraded supervision approach for such institutions. l Monetary instruments and markets: Alongside the liberalization of direct controls on banks (as above) and the development of a more liberalized and unified exchange market (see Box 2 on Exchange System Reforms), critical measures include the freeing-up of shorter-term interbank lending, and examination of additional measures to promote money and securities market development; the introduction of new tradable monetary instruments consistent with Islamic principles, and improvements to existing government borrowing instruments; refocusing and upgrading Bank Markazi Iran’s (BMI) lending and deposit windows; phased unification and reduction of reserve requirements (with sterilization through more efficient instruments); improving the monetary monitoring and analysis framework within BMI. l Payments system: Establish an improved system for quick settlement of large transactions; and development and implementation of a comprehensive strategy for modemizing payment systems operations and instruments, payments risk management, and the legal and regulatory framework for the payments system. l Autonomy of fhncial sector policy institutions: Narrowing and clarifying the objectives of monetary policy, strengthening the autonomy and accountability/transparency of BMI in day-today monetary and exchange management; strengthening of the bank and near-bank supervision function of BMI; and also for the insurance supervisor (including separating out commercial functions).

Islamic Republic of Iran: Exchange System Reforms Effective 1999/2000, the Iranian authorities have significantly reformed their exchange system. Prior to 1999/2000, the Iranian exchange system was subject to heavy but uneven and complex controls, with foreign exchange allocations underpinning a multiple exchange rate system featuring two fixed official exchange rates. In an attempt to introduce a more marketdetermined exchange rate in 1997, the authorities had allowed trading in “import certificated on the Teheran stock exchange (TSE).’ The resulting effective exchange rate (the “TSE rate”) was initially fairly close to rates in the active parallel market, and was managed by the Bank Markazi Irau (BMI) as a form of crawling depreciation. However, as Iran’s external position worsened due to low oil prices, the TSE rate became increasingly out of line with parallel rates over the latter part of 1998 and early 1999, and queuing for foreign exchange in the TSE market grew rapidly. Aided by a significantly improving external position in May 1999, BMI began takiug measures both to rectify the immediate exchange market problems and to initiate more fundamentaI structural reforms. These include: l The backlog of queued demand in the TSE market was cleared through a combination of siguificant additional foreign exchange sales and a substantial step depreciation of the effective TSE exchange rate. Since that time, BMI has acted to clear the balance of demand and supply in the market every day, at an exchange rate that has been gradually depreciating. l The number of import categories financed at the TSE rate was progressively broadened, while import allocations at the official export rate were phased out by late 1999. l In March 2000, import certificates were replaced by “foreign exchange certificates of deposit” (FXCDs) in TSE trading. Although the use of the FXCDs was still limited to the list of specified imports, they were an important transitional step toward a proper foreign exchange market and simplified arrangements by: (a) removing surrender to BMI, and the need to repurchase foreign exchange from BMI, with only the requirement to surrender to the market remaining; and (b) removing the export exchange rate. l Also in March 2000, BMI began allowing banks to purchase foreign exchange from any source (other than export receipts) at freely negotiated rates, and to trade such foreign exchange among themselves. This is an important step in breaking down the regulatory segmentation of the exchange market. The authorities intend these steps to lead to full exchange rate reunification and the creation of an integrated foreign exchange market from Ivlarch 2001. The remaining measures to achieve these goals will need to include explicit fiscal subsidies on various imports currently benefiting from the remaining, substantially appreciated, official exchange rate; further liberalization of exchange controls and the allocation system for current payments (including phasing out compulsory import deposits during 2001-02, and sterilizing the monetary impact with alternative instruments); the abolition of FXCDs and removal of remainin g regulatory barriers to bank-customer and interbank trading of foreign exchange in relation to current transactions; a method to improve the predictability of sales of official oil export revenue (which dominates the supply of foreign exchange) to the market; new, internationally comparable, prudential limits on banks’ open foreign exchange positions; and a more open licensing policy for new foreign exchange dealers. ‘These certificates were allocated to non-oil exporters based on the foreign exchange they surrendered to BMI at the fixed “export” rate. The certificates gave the holder the right to repurchase the same amount of foreign i exchange from BMI, at the same underlying exchange rate, for certain licensed imports. The price at which ~ these certificates traded, plus the underlying export exchange rate, constituted, in effect, a third official exchange rate.

Islamic Republic of Iran: Characteristics of the Bonyad-e-Mustazafan va Janbazan l Bonyad-e-Mud va Janbazan (BMJ); the largest foundation in Iran, controls about 350 enterprises, which are organized in six holding companies, and employs approximately 60,000 workers. Its primary functions include management of these enterprises to generate income for assisting war veterans and support families of soldiers who died during the Iran-Iraq war. The managing director and the Council of Trustees are appointed by the Supreme Leader. l Economic activities are focused on agriculture, food processing, hotels and tourism, petrochemicals, textiles, and construction. All enterprises are subject to the Iranian commercial law as are other private sector enterprises. l Total assets of the BMJ are valued at about US$3.5 billion-mostly real estate-and the total turnover of its enterprises is estimated at about US$1.5 billion or about 1% percent of GDP. i l The foundation has sought cooperation with foreign partners to improve efficiency and increase ~ exports. Its future plans are to divest enterprises in the traditional sector and to expand its operations ~ in the technology intensive activities. l Taxes paid by BMJ are typically refunded to it to finance its social assistance programs. These include financial assistance to about 120,000 families of war veteran and of soldiers who died during the Iran-Iraq war, and cover pensions, Ii-ee health and education services, and housing. The foundation had proposed that the government should consider taking over its social assistance programs rather than refunding taxes.

The authorities indicated that they would transfer to the OSF all revenues from crude oil and gas exports accrued over and above this year’s budgetary targets, which could amount to 2% percent of GDP (Tables 2 and 3). Starting next year, the authorities intend to base the operations of the OSF on a price-contingent rule for crude oil export proceeds. They envisage transfering all crude oil revenue over and above a cut-off price (presently, US$15.75 per barrel) automatically to the OSF. Oil stabilisation and saving funds currently exist in a number of countries and states, including Kuwait, Oman Norway, Venezuela, and Alaska. Chile set up the Copper Stabihzation Fund in 1985. The experiences gained with these funds suggest that in order to be successful they need to be embedded in a sound macroeconomic policy framework, combined with other crucial fiscal policy decisions, and governed by stringent operational rules to ensure good governance and transparency. The Iranian authorities are currently in the process of operationalizing the concept for the OSF. In the SWS view, this concept should be guided by the following: Objectives l The primary objective of the fund would be to smooth revenues and shield the budget and the domestic economy from the adverse impact of volatile and unpredictable world market prices of crude oil (short-term stabilization function). l The reserves accumulated in the fund could allow extending the benefits of non-renewable resources to future generations, building a reserve for contingency purposes, to finance important medium-term reforms or investments (long-term savings function). Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policies l A commodity price stabilization fund cart help stab&zing the economy and avoid the boom-and-bust cycle often associated with sharp commodity price movements. For example, the operations of the Chilean Copper Stabilization Fund and the Norwegian State Petroleum Fund have been combined with conservative expenditure policies, resulting in fiscal surpluses during times of commodity price booms. In the case of Norway, large oil revenues have been sterihzed by investing in finaucial assets abroad thereby dampening inflationary pressures through monetary expansion and protecting competitiveness of non-oil sectors through uuwarmnted real exchange rate appreciation. l To ensure fiscal transparency and accountability, the operations of such a fund should be integrated fully with those of the government budget (“budget unity”). The fund should not be allowed to borrow and its assets should not be used as collateral for borrowing by other public sector entities. Operational Rules l Supervision and management: The division of responsibilities between the government, the central bank and the fund should be clear. As it is the case in Norway and other countries, the fund’s management could be delegated to the central bank. l Investment strategy: The fund’s investment strategy could be similar to that used for managing official foreign exchange reserves. Investments could be limited to low-risk, interest-bearing bonds and bills, with a currency composition defined by a country’s import weights. However, the strategy could also include equities and allow a greater geographical and currency dispersion. l Disclosure and transparency: The operations of the fund should be as tmnsparent as possible, with clearly defined rules on auditing, financial disclosure, and reporting.

Exchange System The foreign exchange market has operated mostly under a multiple exchange system over the past few years. A dual fixed exchange rate system was introduced in 1995 after an attempted exchange rate unification, consisting of an official exchange rate pegged at Rls 1,750 per U.S. dollar and a second official exchange rate-the “export” rate--pegged at Rls 3,000 per U.S. dollar. In July 1997, the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) market for “import certificates” was introduced giving rise to a new effective exchange rate. Upon surrendering at Rls 3,000 per U.S. dollar to the banking system, non-oil exporters were given the right in the form of “import certificates” to repurchase the full amount of foreign exchange from Bank Markazi Iran (BMI) at the same rate; exporters could either use this right themselves for importing or sell the right to a legal importer on the TSE. The premium for the certificate thus produced the more depreciated effective TSE exchange rate. Significant exchange market reforms were implemented from April 1999. A backlog of unmet demand for foreign exchange was cleared in mid-1999 through additional sales by BMI and a substantial depreciation of the TSE exchange rate. Since then, and although still closely managed on a day-to-day basis by BMI, the TSE exchange rate has been significantly more market-based than previously with BMI actively clearing the daily balance of supply and demand in the TSE market, at rates that are gradually depreciating, broadly in line with inflation differentials. Imports financed at the official “export” rate of exchange (Rls 3,000 = US$l) have been progressively and substantially shifted to the TSE exchange rate. The export rate and the import certificate system were abolished and a transitional foreign exchange certificate of deposit market in the TSE was established by end-March 2000. This new certificate arrangement removes the need to surrender non-oil foreign exchange revenue to BMI, and to subsequently repurchase it from BMI for importing. Government oil export proceeds are fully surrendered to BMI at Rls 1,750; in return, they are mostly earmarked for government imports (including essential goods) and external debt service at the same rate, with a small share allocated at Rls 3,000 (until the abolition of this rate and the TSE exchange rate to public enterprises for capital imports. The TSE exchange rate applies to imports based on a positive list which has been recently extended to 41 broad categories. In May 1998, an interbank rate linked to the TSE exchange rate was introduced for certain current account transactions on services previously financed at one of the official fixed rates. In March 2000, banks were permitted to begin purchasing foreign exchange from any source at freely negotiated rates, to trade this exchange among themselves, and to sell it for imports from the positive list and for some other purposes. The period between the date goods are exported and the date export earnings are repatriated has been extended to a uniform eight months for all exports. A bonus system is in place (in the form of retention allowance) which is equivalent to 1 percent per month of the export proceeds for early repatriation and surrendering.

It maintains a multiple currency practice arising out of the multiple exchange rate system. A second multiple currency practice arises from the advance import deposit requirement which is not remunerated and also gives rise to an exchange restriction. The Fund has previously granted approval of these multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions. Last Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 19, 1999.

The Islamic Republic of Iran was an active borrower of the World Bank until 1970s when, following the oil boom, it graduated from the borrower status. In 1991, Bank lending to Iran resumed following the war with Iraq and the substantial decline in incomes, and as the government initiated a program of economic reform and undertook a major reconstruction effort. From 1991 to 1993, the Bank made six loans totaling US$847 million. During that period, the Bank has also prepared a series of economic and sector work on agriculture, mining and industry, energy, environment, transportation, education, trade reform, and financial institutions and capital market. 2. Since 1994, and until May 2000, there have been no new loans, and Bank activities have focused mainly on supervising the implementation of five ongoing projects in flood control, irrigation improvement, power sector efficiency, Tehran drainage system, and basic health. All projects are well implemented and are disbursing satisfactorily. During 1998, the Bank responded to government requests for technical support through four IDF grants. The grants focus on value-added tax reform, enhancing institutional capacity for foreign investment promotion, strengthening banking supervision, and central bank’s asset and liability management. Other areas of technical assistance included privatization and energy subsidies reform. 3. In May 2000, the Bank has approved two loans to Iran in the areas of primary health care and nutrition, and urban environment and infrastructure (Teheran sewerage system). The amounts of the projects are US$87million and US$145 million, respectively. ‘Prepared by the World Bank staff.

The improvement in the key statistical database, in particular, the establishment of the Bank Markazi Iran’s Foreign Debt Department has brought a vast improvement in data on public and publicly guaranteed external debt and debt-service obligations. Recent steps to report monetary data consistent with Islamic finance rules and fiscal data in line with the Government Finance Statistics have been helpful. Real sector statistics Price statistics have generally been reported to STA in a timely manner. However, time series on export and import price indices (based on the export and import components of the WPI) were reported to STA through December 1993. National accounts statistics are basically sound and compilation follows 1993 Standardised National Accounts methodologies. MED has received national accounts estimates for 1999/2000. Bank Markazi has recently compiled quarterly GDP statistics for the period 1986-99, for which, a technical assistance from the STA was provided in 1999, which reviewed and improved the methodology for the compilation of quarterly GDP. Government finance statistics Preliminary estimates on accounts of the general government (central government and 26 provincial governments) for 1999/2000 have been provided to MED. Budget data for 2000/01 were shared with the Fund staff during the consultation discussion. An economic classification of public expenditures was made available to the consultation mission in 1997; recent STA technical assistance will facilitate preparation of economic classification on a regular basis. Data were also provided on government transfers to cover public enterprises’ financial losses through the 2000/01 budget. The STA database contains annual data for the consolidated central government through 1998/99. There are differences between data reported to STA and MED on revenue, expenditure, and net lending, as well as in data classification. A large part of the differences results from the inclusion of data on quasi-fiscal exchange operations in the data provided to MED. Local government data reported to STA are only available through 1989. Only aggregated data on financing have been reported through 1999/2000. Monetary statistics Monetary data are in general provided on a timely basis. Long-standing issues pertain to the lack of information on: (i) detailed accounts on net foreign assets; (ii) detailed accounts on 1 other items net; and (iii) on the data of several time series shown under the international liquidity section of International Financial Statistics.
