Introduction A staff mission u visited Banjul during June 2-17, 1995 to conduct the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions. The Gambian representatives included the late Minister of Finance, the Hon. 0. Koro-Ceesay, the Governor of the Central Bank of Gambia, Mr. C. L. Bajo, the Minister of the Interior, Captain L. Bajo, Mr. A. N'Gum, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, and other senior officials of the Government and parastatal sectors. The mission was received by the Head of State and Chairman of the military council, H.E. Captain Y. Jammeh. Discussions were also held with repre- sentatives of the local donor community and the Chamber of Commerce. The Gambia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle, and the last consultation was held on December 6, 1993. The Gambia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4. On that occasion, Directors commended the authorities on the successful implementation, over several years, of sound macroeconomic policies and market-oriented structural reforms. They noted, nevertheless, that the economy remained fragile and vulnerable to external shocks. They urged the authorities to continue their efforts in reducing structural constraints to growth and the diversification of the economy. While economic management improved greatly during 1985-94, serious problems remain in the quantification of economic and social developments. Official statistics are seriously wanting in several areas, particularly those on national income and expenditure, employment and labor costs, price I/ The mission comprised Mr. J.

'The Gambia's relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are summarized in Appendices I and II, respectively. Statistical issues are discussed in Appendix III, while selected social and demographic indicators are presented in Appendix IV. II. gecent Developments and Prosnects During the period 1985/86-1993/94, The Gambia made substantial progress in reducing financial imbalances and laying the foundation for growth through the successful imlplementation of structural reforms and pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies, in the context of programs supported by the Fund and the World Bank. As a result, real GDP increased at an average annual rate of 3.1 percent, inflation on an end-of-period basis fell from 70.4 percent to minus 1.2 percent, while gross official external reserves rose from 0.3 months of import cover to 5.5 months. Despite this progress, per capita income barely increased during the decade L/ and The Gambia remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Since mid-1993, a series of shocks have buffeted The Gambia, and the country's economic and financial situation has deteriorated significantly. The first round of shocks: started with the suspension by the BCEAO and BEAC of the repurchases of CFA franc bank notes circulating outside their zone of issue, followed by the reinforcement of border and transit trade controls by Senegal (August 1993); it culminated in the devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 and the acceleration of reforms in the CFA franc countries. v The effect of the suspension of the CFA franc bank notes repurchases, while temporarily disruptive, was limited. However, tighter Senegalese customs controls on border and transit trade adversely affected the long- standing lucrative cross-border trade, in which The Gambia thrived through the exploitation of policy distortion:; in neighboring countries, while capitalizing on its efficient port operations, its geographical and commercial comparative advantage in supplying countries in the region, and its early start in implementing market-oriented policies. The devaluation of the CFA franc and strengthening of adjustment measures in CFA franc countries eroded The Gambia's comparar:ive advantages relative to these countries, and weakened the prospects for the transshipment trade. The cumulative declines in re-exports and imports in 1994/95 are estimated at 31 percent and 29 percent, respective:Ly, relative to the 1992/93 levels.

In addition, owing to the ensuing political uncertainties, travel advisories to The Gambia were issued by key tourist source countries (November 1994). The travel advisories severely disrupted the 1994/95 tourist season, and receipts from tourism (The Gambia's second most important source of foreign exchange) plunged by 61 percent. As a result of these developments, real GDP is estimated to have declined by about 4 percent in 1994/95, with a sharp downturn in construction and tourism; and the 12-month rate of inflation accelerated from minus 3 percent in August 1994 to over 5 percent in June 1995, largely as a result of a tightening in imported commodity supplies (Table 1). The downturn in economic activity had a serious impact on fiscal performance. Revenue declined by 13 percent, as the re-export trade shrank, domestic imports fell in response to the recession, tourist receipts plummeted, and public enterprises failed to pay dividends and scheduled interest payments to the Government. With the suspension of balance of payments assistance, loan and grants fell by the equivalent of 3 percent of GDP. Despite attempts to cut spending, current outlays were merely maintained within the budget limits. u Capital expenditure, however, was higher than budgeted in response to higher-than-projected foreign financing. The overall deficit, before grants, thus widened from 2.7 percent of GDP in 1993/94 to 6.3 percent in 1994/95 (Table 2). Monetary developments in 1994/95 were dominated by the financing requirements of the Government, as private sector demand for credit remained sluggish because of the recession and high real interest rates. Net bank credit to the Government increased by the equivalent of 10 percent of broad money at the beginning of the fiscal year, in contrast to large repayments in recent years. Consequently, the net domestic assets of the banking system rose by more than 50 percent. However, most of this expansion in liquidity was allowed to leak out through the balance of payments, with the exchange rate remaining relatively stable, so that broad money grew by only 7 percent, which helped to keep price increases within manageable bounds (Table 3). The external current account deficit, excluding grants, narrowed slightly, as the sharp declines in the re-export trade and tourist receipts were more than offset by the contraction in imports. The suspension of program aid, however, caused the overall balance to move into a deficit for u Inclusive of domestic arrears of about D 8 million accumulated in 1994/95.

I/ The real effective exchange rate generally fluctuated within a narrow range. The exchange rate for the dalasi, remained relatively stable in terms of the U.S. dollar but declined by about 8 percent against the SDR, and by 7 percent against the CFA franc. The spread between the interbank and parallel market exchange rates remained stable at about 5 percent. The deterioration in the economic situation was accompanied by a marked erosion of confidence as a result of growing government interference in economic activity, particularly in the operations of public enterprises. Government actions in these areas have included: the importation of rice, without paying sales tax and with financing that could compromise the financial health of the Social Security Fund; the destruction of a large private rice import shipment for less than convincing reasons; and a request to the state telecommunications company (GAMTEL) to undertake an expensive television project. These actions have raised serious questions about the future direction of government policy and led to complaints about unfair state competition with the private sector. III. ReDOrt on the Discussions Given the economic and financial deterioration that occurred in 1994/95, the authorities' macroeconomic objectives for 1995/96 are the re-establishment of macroeconomic stability and a recovery in economic activity. More specifically, their objectives are to: (a) achieve a real growth rate of at least 2 percent; (b) limit the rate of inflation to no more than 6 percent; and (c) limit the external current account to about 19 percent of GDP, while minimizing a further decline in gross official reserves. These objectives are to be achieved through a substantial improvement in the fiscal performance, the maintenance of a tight stance of monetary policy, and relative foreign exchange market stability in the context of a market-determined interbank exchange system. Near-term prospects are scarcely encouraging. The re-export trade is expected, at best, to stabilize, assuming a resolution of confidence problems. Tourism should rebound after the lifting of travel advisories to The Gambia; but even with a recovery in tourism, real GDP is unlikely to rise by more than 2 perceint in 1995/96, as political uncertainty and the maintained suspension of program aid continue to dampen investment. l-J Gross official reserves, however, rose in months of import cover because of a sharp fall in imports. There was also a marked deterioration in the net foreign asset position of the commercial banks and a substantial drawdown of parastatal foreign currency accounts--all reflected in short- term capital in the balance of payments.

The staff therefore urged the Government to take steps to strengthen private sector confidence, in part by clearly reaffirming its commitment to a liberal trading and exchange system and the primacy of the private sector in the country's development strategy. A key to the confidence issue will be the Government's adherence to the agreed political reform agenda. The authorities generally agreed on the necessity to reinforce private sector confidence. Against this background, the policy discussions focused on ways to strengthen macroeconomic policies, particularly fiscal policy, with a view to containing inflation and minimizing external reserve losses; to restore confidence and reduce uncertainty about the stance of government policies; and to improve competitiveness in light of recent developments in the sub- region. In general, despite recent initiatives that appeared to send opposite signals, the authorities reiterated their commitment to a development strategy based on the promotion of private sector activity, through continued structural reforms, the maintenance of a liberal trading and exchange system, and the pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies. They expressed concern over the limited progress made to date in alleviating poverty. The authorities underlined the critical role of donor support in the successful implementation of their structural adjustment program, and expressed the hope that the political reform agenda, which is to culminate in general elections in June 1996, would meet donors' concerns. 1. Fiscal policy The authorities agreed with the staff that a tightening of fiscal policy was critical to the re-establishment of macroeconomic stabflity. The staff argued that, to contain inflation and limit external official reserve losses, while maintaining relative exchange market stability, the fiscal objectives for 1995/96 should be to limit the overall budget deficit, before grants, to no more than 2 percent of GDP; and, as a minimum to overall balance after grants. This fiscal stance, aimed at a 4 percentage reduction in the deficit, would virtually eliminate the need for government recourse to bank financing and allow for adequate credit to the private sector in support of the growth objectives. To attain these objectives, the staff urged the authorities to undertake a package of revenue measures that would yield additional receipts amounting to 1 percent of GDP (including the impact of tax reform measures described below). The specific measures suggested included the extension of the sales tax to electricity consumption and other services, the taxation of fringe benefits, and a reduction in customs duty exemptions. The staff also urged the authorities to continue to implement tax reform measures, including the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the rationalization of the turnover tax, and the initiation of tariff reform, within the context of the ongoing overall fiscal reform effort. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - In light of the limited scope for further revenue increases, the staff stressed that the growth of government. outlays should be strictly controlled. To this end, clear-cut expenditure priorities would need to be established to ensure adequate budget provision for high priority sectors, such as health and education. In particular, the staff proposed that the wage bill only be allowed to increase in response to regular earnings drift and essential recruitment in priority sectors. The authorities agreed with the desirability of meeting these fiscal objectives, although they underscored the difficulties of a substantial fiscal improvement in the context of a. continuing cutoff of program aid and strong pressure for expenditure increases. They explained that an independent wage and salary commission had recommended raising civil service pay by about 15 percent. In addition, planned recruitment in the health and education sector would add significantly to the growth of the wage bill. Measures to raise additional revenue, therefore, were seen as unavoidable to avert unsustainable cutbacks in other charges. The authorities reiterated their commitment to further fiscal reforms, after the delays in 1994/95, which they attributed to the political circumstances prevailing in that year. The authorities considered that: the reform of the external tariff, in particular, would help to reposition The Gambia in the re-export market; however, not enough preparations had been made to allow for a comprehensive start of these reforms in 1995/96. Nevertheless, some limited steps would be taken in 1995/96, with a view to launching a comprehensive reform in 1996/97. lJ The budget for 1995/96, which was. announced on July 3, 1995, takes into account many of the staff's fiscal policy recommendations. The overall deficit objectives and targets, before. and after grants, are broadly in line with the suggestions of the mission, but they differ with regard to the mix of revenue and expenditure policy meas,ures. 0 On the revenue side, the budget calls for the extension of the sales tax to advertising revenue; the impo.sition of a 10 percent withholding tax on contractors' fees; the inclusion of fringe benefits in the base for income taxation; substantial increases, in fees, charges and licenses; the imposition of a training levy; and a number of other minor revenue measures. This package, however, falls somewhat short of the effort required to ensure attainment of the revenue target, in part because the authorities decided against extending the sales tax to electricity consumption--potentially the main high-yielding revenue measure. Also, the yield of some of the new revenue measures is uncertain. At the same time, the budget appears to make insufficient allowance for the possibility that dividends and taxes paid by GAMTEL could be significantly lower than budgeted, given the decision to proceed with the television project as: planned. Accordingly, the staff L/ The Gambia submitted its bound t:ariffs to the WTO in March 1995. The bound tariffs are 25 percent higher thLan the current effective rates. A decree ratifying the WTO agreement is expected in the near future.

Business registration is to be linked to the tax identification number and submission of audited accounts. The corporate tax rate reduction from 50 percent to 35 percent, which was announced but not implemented in 1994/95, will become effective on January 1, 1996. On the same date, the turnover tax will be replaced by a penalty tax of 2 percent on companies delaying or not submitting audited returns. These two actions are in line with the staff recommendations, except for the six-month delay in the effective date of their implementation. 0 On the expenditure side, the budget does not grant a general wage and salary increase, although the wage bill is still to increase by 6 percent on account of wage drift and recruitment in health and education. With modest increases in other allocations, however, total expenditures will be held some 0.5 percent o'f GDP below the level discussed with the mission. Defense expenditures, which have averaged about 0.7 percent of GDP in recent years, are budgeted to rise to 0.9 percent of GDP in 1995/96. The staff estimates that both the overall budget deficit and bank financing targets discussed during the mission could be exceeded by more than 0.3 percent of GDP respectively. This potential slippage, if not offset, will have to be financed by a higher level of domestic financing for the Government. To maintain the inflation and external sector objectives, the increase in domestic financing would only be possible by reducing credit available to the private sector. It would therefore be critically important to monitor carefully revenue developments and to stand ready to take additional measures in the event of a revenue shortfall. To'facilitate this, quarterly expenditure should be backloaded to allow room for expendi- ture reductions in response to any revenue shortfall. 2. Public enternrises Government control over the operations of public enterprises (PEs) has slipped in recent years as decision making and public enterprise supervision were placed outside the Ministry of Finance. In 1994/95, the public enterprise monitoring unit was moved to the Ministry of Finance, but remained largely ineffective, because key experienced personnel left on account of low salaries. Discussions with the authorities centered on recent instances of intervention in enterprise operations, particularly the decisions requiring them to undertake projects on behalf of the Government, which were unrelated to their regular business. The authorities argued that the enterprises themselves had indicated no sign of financial problems. They agreed, however, that the process of passing projects on to parastatals was contrary to the Government's policy of evaluating capital outlays within the context and priorities of its investment program. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - The staff urged that the GAMTEL television project be canceled, or at least substantially scaled down. It also recommended that parastatal capital budgets be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval. The staff urged a renewed drive toward the privatization of public enterprises-- such as those in the hotel and transport sector--some of which were making significant losses. The authorities' policy stance regarding the public enterprise sector remained, in principle, that PEs should operate on a commercial basis. The need to develop a comprehensive policy position was accepted; however, the authorities also emphasized the importance of an efficient monitoring unit to develop and implement policy options in this sector. For that reason, they considered technical assistance for the unit as a key priority. There is no indication, however, in tlhe budget statement that the television project might be canceled or scaled down. In contrast, the Government has accepted the staff's suggestions that the foreign accounts of parastatals be monitored by the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG), and that public enterprises' capital budgets be approved by the Ministry of Finance. 3. Monetary policy Given the dominant influence of fiscal developments on the course of financial developments, central bank policy in 1994/95 sought to mitigate the monetary impact of the surging financing requirements of the Government through active reliance on treasury auctions and issues of CBG bills. The effect of these measures was to maintain interest rates appropriately high and positive in real terms. Monetary policy in 1995/96 should be Ihelped by the intention virtually to eliminate the Government's domestic financing requirements. In addition, a joint monitoring team of the CBG and the Ministry of Finance is to be set up to provide early warning about the need to tighten fiscal policy in support of monetary policy objectives. The containment of inflation, therefore, could be achieved without crowding out the private sector. The monetary objectives for 1995/96 are to sharply reduce the growth of the net domestic assets of the banking system to under 5 percent of broad money at the beginning of the year, and to limit the overall increase in broad money to 8 percent. This would permit credit to the private sector to expand by about 8 percent, while allowing for an improvement in net foreign assets position. Regarding financial sector reform, no measures were initiated in 1994/95. The reform of reserve requirements and of the liquidity ratio for banks recommended by prior technical assistance mission from the Fund had generally been accepted; however, no action has been taken because the CBG was still reviewing the associated issue of foreign currency deposits in local banks and the related prudential guidelines. To increase competition within the banking system, the CBG was reviewing guidelines for commercial banks to publish their charges for various services.

External sector Dolicies and nrosnectg The authorities reiterated their commitment to a liberal trading and exchange system, which they believed had facilitated a smooth and resilient absorption of recent shocks. In the near term, the authorities' major objectives would be to minimize external reserve losses and avoid a sharp depreciation of the dalasi. With the projected strengthening of demand management policies, they expected these objectives to be attainable. The CBG underscored its policy of limiting its intervention in the foreign exchange market only to meet its external reserve objective and to smooth short-term exchange rate fluctuations. The interbank foreign exchange market, however, was not considered to be very active because, for prudential and other reasons, authorized dealers rarely dealt among themselves, preferring to deal with the CBG and, at times, the parallel market. Nevertheless, the CBG was satisfied that, despite these structural problems, the foreign exchange market operated relatively efficiently, as the parallel market forced participants in the interbank market to conform to market trends. Despite indications of an apparent erosion of competitiveness in the re-export market (see Chart 3), the authorities considered the level of the exchange rate appropriate. The staff argued that, to some extent, the level of the exchange rate had been underpinned by the substantial loss in external reserves in 1994/95, which might have also prevented it from adjusting fully to the long-term effects of the recent external shocks. In addition, the staff emphasized that in 1995/96, the exchange rate would be expected to play a larger role in external adjustment, particularly in the event of unexpectedly severe pressure on the external position. The authorities underlined their commitment to the pursuit of fiscal and monetary policies that would help in avoiding such pressure and ensure attainment of their external objectives. They argued that the relative stability of the exchange rate in 1994/95 was, to a significant extent, due to the almost symmetric impact of external shocks on the supply and demand for foreign exchange. Thus, as re-exports fell, related imports also declined in tandem; similarly, the sharp drop in tourism was accompanied by a corresponding fall in related imports. They agreed with the staff, however, on the need to improve the operation of the interbank market, through greater encouragement of more competition and more effective bank supervision to increase trust among authorized dealers. The mission discussed the medium-term outlook for growth and the balance of payments, in light of recent policy changes in the region, and other external factors. The devaluation of the CFA franc had significantly eroded The Gambia's competitiveness relative to Senegal and other CFA franc zone countries in the region, thereby reducing growth prospects for trade Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - and tourism. lJ The authorities agreed that the changed prospects for the re-export trade required that the country take aggressive action not only to improve its comparative advantage as an entrep8t center, but also to diversify its services. They noted., for example, that in response to border difficulties for transit trade, encouragement was being given to the development of coastal shipping. Negotiations were under way with Senegal to find a mutually satisfactory solution to the issue of controls on transit trade. The authorities were optimistic that a solution would be found to revitalize transhipment trade to the hinterland. Their main hope, however, lay in the development of the Gateway project, which is geared toward developing Banjul as a free port, providing a number of transshipment and warehousing services for the region. IImplementation of this phase is planned to start in 1995/96. A related port expansion project, a joint venture with the National Fishing Gompany of China, will also provide a base for that company's fishing fleet in the region, with potential for local fish processing. The revised medium-term base scenario assumes a modest recovery in the re-export trade over the medium term and a resumption of program aid after 1995/96. On this basis, and taking the World Economic Outlook projections for commodity prices, exports in SDR terms would increase at an average annual rate of about 3 percent during 1995/96-1999/2000. The volume of imports would increase in line with domestic output and the needs of the re-export trade. The external current account deficit, before grants, would decline from nearly 19 percent of GDP in 1995/96 to about 9 percent in 1999/2000. 2/ Assuming the continuation of project assistance at about current levels in SDR terms, this scenario would yield declining financing ga.ps , from about SDR 8 million in 1.996/97 to SDR 3 million by 1999/2000. Alternative scenarios underscore the country's vulnerability to terms of trade shocks and disruptions in external assistance. For example, a 20 percent fall in the! volume of r-e-exports relative to the baseline scenario assumption would raise the annual current account deficit by nearly 2 percentage points of GDP and raise financing gaps by about 45 percent ab'ove the respective baseline scenario levels. Alternatively, a 20 percent increase in external groundnut prices above the levels assumed in the base scenario would reduce the external current account deficits by l/2 of a percentage point annually and reduce financing gaps by nearly 20 percent (see Table 5). The Gambia's external debt service ratio is projected to decline from 18 percent in 1994/95 to about 12 percent in 1999/2000. l.J The Gambia's competitive advantage in tourism has also been narrowed by the depreciation of several currencies of The.Gambia's traditional competitors in the mediterranean. While wage costs are lower in The Gambia, energy costs are among the highest in Africa. u The rise in the external current account in 1995/96 is explained by the initiation of the port expansion project in that year, which is scheduled to end in 1997/98. Private capital inflows increase in 1995/96 on account of the projected investment financed by private direct investment, an element of the port expansion project.

StaffADeraisal After nearly a decade of successful adjustment based on market-oriented reforms and prudent macroeconomic policies, The Gambia's economy has recently been buffeted by a series of shocks that have combined to generate a serious erosion of confidence and downturn in economic activity, and to place a heavy strain on macroeconomic management. The decline in output, and an inadequate policy response to the related fall in revenue, contributed to a marked deterioration in fiscal performance during 1994/95. Fiscal performance was also adversely affected by the suspension of program aid, which, in the event, led to increased government reliance on bank financing and put pressure on the exchange rate. Given the severity of the shocks, however, the authorities made a creditable effort in limiting the extent of financial deterioration and containing inflation to 5-7 percent during 1993/94-1994/95. These developments threaten to reverse the gains achieved after nearly a decade of successful adjustment. Corrective measures are therefore urgently needed to re-establish macroeconomic stability and restore confidence. In this regard, the expeditious restoration of confidence would be a critical factor in the recovery of economic activity, the improvement in public finances, and the stabilization of the.exchange market. The scheduled elections in June 1996, if properly conducted, should go some way in rebuilding confidence, through the resumption of program aid. The overriding policy priority in 1995/96 is for the public sector to implement measures, in a timely manner, that would bring about a substantial improvement in its financial position. In this context, the fiscal objectives for 1995/96 should be to aim at an overall balance (after grants) and to eliminate the need for bank financing for the budget. Prospects for revenue growth are limited, so attainment of these objectives would require strict control over expenditure growth. The staff welcomes the announced budget for 1995/96, which represents a significant step in the right direction, although it appears to fall somewhat short of these objectives. Correction for the potential shortfall would strengthen the authorities' chances of attaining fiscal and external sector targets while avoiding the crowding out of the private sector. The staff urges the authorities to monitor revenue performance very carefully, and to stand ready to implement additional fiscal tightening if a revenue shortfall develops. To this end, the quarterly phasing of expenditures should be backloaded to afford room for intervention in the event of slippage. The stance of monetary policy needs to continue to be focused on the containment of inflation. The CBG should continue to control domestic liquidity by limiting the growth of reserve money through treasury bill auctions and the issuance of its own bills.

The CBG's exchange market inter- vention policy should be guided solely by its foreign reserve target and the need to smooth short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. Measures should be taken to improve competition in the interbank market and to improve confidence among exchange m.arket participants. The Government's increasing intervention in the operations of public enterprises has hampered their capacity to meet their tax and dividend obligations, and seriously threatens'their future financial viability. The staff regrets the decision to continue with GAMTEL's television project, and urges the authorities to cancel it, or, at least, to scale it down substantially. The staff also urges the Government to reconsider other projects planned by pulblic enterprises outside their primary mission and to subject all parastatal capital budgets to review and approval by the Ministry of Finance. The medium-term outlook remains difficult and uncertain. The country's medium-term viability ,will critically depend on the re-establishment of macroeconomic stabilit,y, the continued implementation of structural reforms, and the normalization of relations with foreign donors. Competitiveness with countries in the region would need to be strengthened through policies that would induce further diversification and improve productivity. To this end, the pace of structural reforms will have to be accelerated. In this regard, the operational efficiency of key parastatals, such as those providing telephone and electricity services, would need to be significantly improved to reduce operating costs for businesses. In sum, it is crucial that The Gam’bia return as soon as possible to the path of sound management and intenaify its structural adjustment policies for which it had set such an encouraging and successful example over 1985-93. It is because of this successful earlier management and good economic performance that The Gambia was able to weather the shocks of the last two years with only limited damage. This effort needs to be built on to conserve past gains, and strengthen an economy that remains fragile, and where much still has to be done to raise living standards.

VIII. Last Article IV Consultation The staff report (EBS/93/173) for the last Article IV consultation was discussed by the Executive Board on December 6, 1993. The midterm review for the 1993/94 program under the procedures for enhanced surveillance was concluded on May 13, 1994 (EBS/94/90). The 1994 Article IV consultation discussions were initiated in September 1994, but deferred in view of the economic and political uncertainty following the military coup. 'The Gambia is on the standard 12-month cycle for Article IV consultations. IX. T chn e (a) A MAE technical assistance mission on monetary management and bank supervision visited The Gambia in January/February 1994.

Bank-supported operations have assisted the Government in pursuing three main objectives: (i) establishment of,a macroeconomic and sectoral environment conducive to economic growth; (ii) rehabilitation and development of infrastructure; and. (iii) development of human resources. Bank-supported projects have contributed to strengthening.the Government's capacity in macroeconomic management, in-providing more efficient social services, and in promoting the development of the private sector. Project implementation, however, continues to encounter. significant problems.. Since the completion'of SAL.11 on June 30, 1992, the Board of Directors has approved three new.investment operations: (a) Agricultural Services in January 1993; (b) Public Works and Capacity Building in,December 1993; and (c). Environment Management Capacity Building in March 1994. Total funds committed under the three operations. total US$26 million.. 2. In addition to SAL II, which provided a global framework for the Bank's support to the policy reforms in The Gambia, the Bank's support to policy and. institutional reforms continued.through five operations. Under the Enterprise .Development Project, 'the Government has made progress in promoting private sector investment in small and medium-scale activities, in privatizing and restructuring public enterprises, inimproving the management contract system, in strengthening financial performance of several public enterprises,, and in strengthening the financial sector partly through the privatization of the,Gambian Commercial and Development Bank (GCDB). The results achieved through the promotion of extension and other agricultural services under the Agricultural Development II Project are being further strengthened by the Agricultural Services Project. Projects in the transport, utility and urban sectors contributed to promoting private sector activities by improving maintenance/rehabilitation of infrastructure, and by rendering better services with a more efficient use of public resources. 3. Bank-supported operations in the social sectors were designed to help the Government to: (1) improve the quality of primary education and raise school enrollment under the Education Sector Project; (ii) improve family planning programs, increase access to health care, and raise the efficiency of health services under the National Health Development Project; and promote the women's role in socio-economic development under the Women in Development Project. 4. In FY 1994, overall satisfactory economic management provided a good environment to improve portfolio performance. The successful July 1993 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR), organized and managed by the Government, resulted in the formulation of an Action Plan to further improve implementation. The Bank has continued to work closely with the Government to address specific issues in the areas of accounting/auditing, procurement/disbursement, management of technical assistance, and the need for more effective communication and coordination among the various Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - IX II Zbe G&la - lat&ns ith the orld B nk Group (continued) (As If April YO, 199:) I ministries, donors, and other stakeholders. While these efforts resulted in a noticeable improvement in portfolio performance, the July 1994 coup has cast some uncertainty over project implementation. Implementation delays were experienced in most projects immediately following the coup due to a temporary suspension of disbursements in all IDA credits. Most projects have since, however, picked up pace in execution, and as of the end of April 1995, disbursements on the aggregate are on track. 5. Recent political developments and, in particular, the withdrawal of key donors have led to the postponement of new IDA commitments. Preparation of new operations has slowed down considerably, Thus, the proposed F'Y 1995-98 lending program assumes effective resolution of the political situation by July 1996. No lending is anticipated for PY 1995, and in PY 1996, only one project, the Health and Population Project, is proposed to consolidate gains in sectoral reforms and improved services initiated under the ongoing NHDP and WID projects. 6. The planned hybrid Economic Management SECAL (M 1997 operation) will focus on public resources management particularly in health, education, economic infrastructure and on civil service reform. The proposed Third Education Project (PY 1998 operation) wrould also consolidate education sector reforms which are being introduced under the PY 1990 Education Sector Credit. In infrastructure, the Trade Gateway Project and an Urban Environment Management Operation are planned for FY 1997.

Except for the consumer price index, the statistical data reported to STA are uncurrent. Bet even for the consumer price index, the obsolescence of the weights used in its compilation, derived from a 1968-69 household budget survey, casts some doubt on its accuracy. The recent 1992,193 household survey could form a basis to update ,weights used in its compilation. National accounts data are produced with a time lag. IMF missions are provided with GDP estimates from the origin side; however, this series :is subject to frequent changes. No official data are produced relating to national expenditure accounts. There is a long lag in processing external trade data--the most recent figures refer to the third quarter of 1992. No data are provided on producer prices, production, employment and earnings. 2. Government finance The data on grants, expenditure, financing, and debt for the years 1983-1989 are not published in the GFS Yearbook because of inconsistencies with the area department data. The latest data published in the GFS Year- book pertain to 1990, and were prepared by the November 1992 GFS mission. No data have been submitted since that mission, and the authorities have recently indicated a need for assistance in completing the GFS question- naire. Although quarterly reporting on the recurrent budget is in place, the compilation of data relating to overall budgetary performance remains fragmentary, and reconciliation with monetary accounts is typically done by IMF missions. In view of the serious human resource constraints in the Ministry of Finance, this is unlikely to change in the near future. 3. Monetarv accounts and interest rat- After expiration of the 1993/94 Fund-monitored program and following the July 22, 1994 military coup, the transmission of data for the monetary authorities, deposit money banks, and interest rates was interrupted. Even though transmission of data resumed in February 1995, updates have been sent infrequently and in batches covering several months. Data for deposits of other financial institutions have not been updated since January 1991. 4. Balance of oavments Data are compiled by different bodies. The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) adjusts balance of payments data for estimated re-export trade activities which are largely unrecorded.
