Real GDP growth is projected to be 8½ percent in 2008 with non-oil growth at about 10 percent. Twelve-month inflation has picked up to 14 percent by September 2008, driven largely by a rise in food prices, but is expected to moderate in the coming months.  The 2008 fiscal position is likely to be better than programmed, largely due to higher world oil prices and improved expenditure controls. The overall balance, savings in the Oil Stabilization Account, and domestic arrears clearance are projected to be better than programmed. The improvement in the overall balance is anchored in good expenditure controls. Non-oil fiscal performance, however, is likely to be less satisfactory with tax revenues being lower than programmed. Important reforms were implemented under the 2007–08 staff-monitored program, though some with a delay that contributed to the accumulation of domestic arrears in 2007. Performance under the SMP so far in 2008 has improved compared to 2007. Four out of five quantitative targets for end-June were met; the target on payments to the Fund was missed. Staff recommendations The 2009 budget needs to strike a balance between reducing inflation and sustaining strong growth. The intention to significantly reduce the stock of domestic arrears is welcome. The fuel subsidy should be explicitly reported in the budget, shared with the subnational governments, and phased out in favor of a targeted social safety net. It will be necessary to aim for a steady improvement in the non-oil primary balance. A cautious monetary stance needs to be maintained to keep inflationary pressures in check. There are risks to inflation from higher commodity prices and the reduction/clearance of domestic arrears. If necessary, monetary policy and the pace of arrears clearance need to be adjusted to contain inflationary pressures. Fiscal reforms are critical to maintain macroeconomic stability and sustain broad-based growth. There is an urgent need to increase tax revenues, strengthen revenue administration, and improve the quality of budget preparation and execution at all levels of government. Appropriate incentives must also be established for subnational governments to collect own-source revenues, both by undertaking tax policy measures and public financial management systems. Financial sector vulnerabilities need to be addressed requiring, in particular, a restructuring of Omdurman Bank. More generally, prompt corrective actions are needed when banks fall short of meeting prudential requirements.

Sudan has maintained close cooperation with the Fund over the last decade, as evidenced by generally good performance under successive staff-monitored programs (SMPs) and by making payments in excess of obligations falling due. The discussions focused on (i) policies to ensure macroeconomic stability in the context of higher commodity prices and a rapidly changing economic landscape; (ii) fiscal reforms needed to finance growing infrastructure and social needs; and (iii) financial sector reforms to address current vulnerabilities and develop the financial system.  II.   RECENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS1 2.      The political situation remains complicated. In July 2008, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) accused Sudan’s president of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Darfur. The deployment of the hybrid African Union-United Nations peace-keeping force to improve security in the region has meanwhile remained slow, making the work of humanitarian agencies difficult. The United Nations has warned that Darfur faces a food shortage this year as a result of growing violence and continued influx in refugee camp. On the positive side, North-South tensions have eased following the agreement to allow international arbitration of the disputed oil-rich Abyei region. Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled to be held in 2009. 3.      Economic growth so far in 2008 remains strong but inflation has risen. Real GDP growth is projected to be 8.5 percent in 2008 with non-oil growth at about 10 percent (Table 1). A slight drop in oil output was more than offset by the continued growth in services, which have become the engine of growth in Sudan. Nevertheless, a drop in foreign investment and private sector credit contributed to slower growth in the non-oil sector (excluding services) relative to 2007. Inflation meanwhile rose from 9 percent at end-2007 to 25 percent in August before falling back to 14 percent in September. This mainly reflects the rise in world food prices. Inflation is expected to have subsided by end-2008 in line with declining international food prices. A new CPI, released in September, shows that high imported food prices have affected rural areas more than urban areas.  -2024681012200320042005200620072008Real oil GDPReal non-oil GDPMCD Low income(y/y growth, Percent)ProjectionsSudan: Real GDP Growth, 2003-08-10-5051015202530Jan-06May-06Sep-06Jan-07May-07Sep-07Jan-08May-08Sep-08OthersFoodEnergyTransportationOverall CPI(12-month inflation, percent)Sudan: CPI Inflation, 2006-08024681012Chad  Egypt  EritreaEthiopia  Kenya  Libya Rwanda SudanUganda  Sudan: Average Real GDP Growth inSelected Countries, 2003-07 (In percent)Sources:IMF, World Economic Outlook                                                  1 See “Sudan—First Review of Performance Under the 2007–08 Staff Monitored Program” (EBS/08/57; 5/16/08) for a review of performance in 2007.

The fiscal position has improved following the difficulties of 2007 due to higher oil revenues and improved expenditure controls (Table 2). Oil revenues were 1 percent of GDP higher than programmed in the first half of 2008 and are projected to overperform the annual target by about 2 percent of GDP. The increase, explained largely by higher world oil prices, was partly offset by weaker non-oil revenues, which registered a ½ percent of GDP shortfall relative to the half-year target (see below). However, cash expenditures—excluding the fuel subsidy and oil-related transfers to the South2—remained within overall program limits, despite faster clearance of arrears inherited from 2007.3 Overall, the 2008 cash deficit is expected to decline to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2008 from 3.1 percent of GDP in 2007, as envisaged under the SMP. 5.      Non-oil fiscal performance, however, is likely to be less satisfactory. Non-oil domestic revenues (projected at 8.8 percent of non-oil GDP) will fall short of the annual target (9.7 percent) due mainly to a halving of the corporate income tax rate from 30 to 15 percent for the largest taxpayers, and the cancellation of a planned telecom license sale.4 Moreover, higher oil prices have raised the fuel subsidy to 1.7 percent of GDP, some 0.2 percent of GDP above program. Overall, the 2008 non-oil primary accrual deficit is projected at 8.1 percent of non-oil GDP, somewhat worse than programmed (6.9 percent), but better than the level registered in 2007 (10.4 percent). 6.      Monetary growth has recovered following the sharp slowdown in 2007. This likely reflects the reduction of domestic arrears. Twelve-month reserve money and broad money increased by 30 percent and 21 percent, respectively, by end-August 2008, but remain below  program targets. Credit to the private sector remains weak, reflecting lower demand and the time lag of arrears clearance on the economy (Tables 3 and 4).                                                  2 Oil-related transfers to the Government of South Sudan, enshrined in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, have been higher than programmed due to higher oil prices, but also to a rising share of the South (Dar Blend) in total production. 3 Arrears clearance in 2008 is projected to exceed 1.2 percent of GDP compared with the 0.9 percent envisaged in the SMP. 4 Increasing abuse of widespread VAT exemptions, especially on imports; difficulties with claiming the federal share in stamp duties collected in the Northern states; and the reduction in effective import tariff rates on wheat also appear to be contributing to weaker tax collection.

Financial sector indicators show continued vulnerability, but there are some signs of improvement. Gross nonperforming loans (NPLs) remained high at 22 percent in June 2008, compared with 26 percent at end-2007. The NPL position of two of the three problem banks has improved following the merger of one bank and the change of management of the second bank. The position of Omdurman Bank, however, has further deteriorated. 8.      The external current account improved in the first half of 2008, due mostly to higher oil receipts. Oil exports more than doubled in dollar terms reflecting the surge in oil prices (Table 5). Non-oil exports, however, remained weak because of problems in sesame and livestock exports. Import growth was also slow, reflecting a fall in imports of machinery and transport equipment associated with the credit squeeze caused by the accumulation of domestic arrears. As a result, reserves increased to about US$1.8 billion by August 2008, higher than envisaged in the program for end-2008, despite huge foreign currency sales by the Central Bank of Sudan (CBS). The overall current account deficit is expected to be about 5 percent of GDP in 2008 compared with 11 percent of GDP in 2007. The exchange rate has shown increasing flexibility since the end of the currency conversion in mid 2007.5 The pound has depreciated by about 7 percent and 20 percent vis-à-vis the dollar and euro, respectively, since September 2007. -40-30-20-1001020302004200520062007H1 2008Services andincome (net)ImportsNon-oil ExportsOil ExportsCurrent accountSudan: External Balance Developments, 2004-H1 2008(as a share of GDP, percent)Note: H1 2008 is annualized number.0246810122004200520062007H1 2008Note: H1 2008 is annualized number.Sudan: FDI and Portfolio inflows, 2004-H1 2008(as a share of GDP, percent)                                                  5 The currency conversion was mandated by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the North and the South.

Performance under the SMP has improved relative to 2007. Four out of five quantitative targets for end-June 2008 were met (Table 7). The quantitative target on payments to the Fund was missed: actual payments through June totaled US$18.3 million  relative to the target of US$25 million. However, two (out of the four) end-June structural measures were missed (Table 8). Specifically, a modified Customs Law that provides valuation guidelines for questionable assessment has not yet been submitted to parliament6 and tax identification numbers for all corporate and individual income taxpayers have not been introduced due to technical reasons. 10.      Important structural reforms have been implemented under the SMP, though some with a delay. The 2008 budget was prepared using the GFSM 2001 framework—which should increase transparency and facilitate timely monitoring of arrears. Bold steps were taken to rein in tax exemptions, widen the tax base, and improve tax administration. Nevertheless, public financial management reforms (such as the establishment of a centralized debt unit and commitment controls to limit expenditures by budget units) were delayed till April 2008, contributing to the accumulation of domestic arrears in 2007. An independent audit of Omdurman Bank—which was to begin by end-2007 as a first step toward restructuring/privatization of the bank—was also delayed to May 2008; the audit was completed in September 2008. III.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS A.   Overview 11.      The challenges facing Sudan are immense and complex. The shifting economic setting associated with implementing the various peace agreements—and the steep volatility in world commodity prices—create risks to macroeconomic stability in the short term. The need to strengthen the revenue base—in the context of less favorable oil production outlook and expenditure pressures—and develop the financial system are medium-term challenges that must be addressed to sustain growth.                                                   6 The modified Customs Law has been approved by the Council of Ministers and is currently being vetted by the Justice Ministry before its submission to parliament.

Economic growth is likely to remain strong in the period ahead. Real GDP growth is projected to remain in the 7–9 percent range in 2009–11 despite a moderation in oil production. The authorities plan to focus on increasing agricultural production over the medium term, whose potential remains largely untapped (see Letter of Intent, LoI, ¶6). They have formulated a plan to develop the agricultural sector that focuses on providing an enabling environment to investors. The focus is on attracting strategic foreign investors by providing better infrastructure, removing structural rigidities and distortions, liberalizing investment and labor market policies, reforming the legal system, and improving the business environment. The intention is to invest about US$5 billion in the sector during 2008–11, the bulk of which is expected to be in the form of foreign investment. 13.      But inflation is a challenge. The authorities are concerned about the impact of higher food prices on the poor, but noted that there is little that monetary policy can do in the short term to control imported inflation (LoI, ¶4). Non-food inflation, meanwhile, remains low, suggesting that the second round effects of food inflation have been minimal so far (Box 1). The authorities agree that it will be critical to closely monitor price developments and to avoid price expectations being adjusted upward. Their objective is to return to single digit inflation in 2009. -0.04-0.020.000.020.040.060.08123456789101112131415161718192021222324Response of Non-food Inflation to Food Inflation Shock 1/Source: IMF staff estimates.1/ Bold line is the estimated impulse response and dotted lines are 95 confidence interval, respectively. Data periods: January 1999-June 2008.  Box 1. Has the Food Price Shock Had Second Round Effects on Non-Food Inflation?  Given the recent spike in inflation, largely related to higher world food prices, there is the risk that imported inflation may have second round effects on non-food prices.1 A simple vector autoregression model (VAR) with monthly data of non-food inflation—a proxy for core inflation—food prices, broad money growth, and changes in the nominal exchange rate suggests that the second round effects of food price shocks on non-food inflation remain minimal so far. Rather, the results show that the main determinants of non-food inflation are broad money growth and nominal exchange rate depreciation. These results are consistent with an earlier study of  inflation dynamics in Sudan.2 Nevertheless, given the weight of food in the CPI basket, it will be important to closely monitor developments and take corrective measures to contain inflation.    1 The weight of food in the CPI basket is over 60 percent. 2 See: Moriyama, 2008, “Investigating Inflation Dynamics in Sudan”, (WP/08/189).

Rising subnational transfers and increasing dependency on oil revenues need to be addressed. The expected improvement in headline fiscal balances in 2008 need to be viewed against the backdrop of weak non-oil indicators that are associated with low tax revenues and strong expenditure pressures. The authorities concurred with this assessment and were receptive to staff recommendations on maintaining a cautious fiscal stance for the remainder of 2008 and beyond. They underlined their commitment to (i) resisting current spending pressures; (ii) using the usable oil windfall for arrears reduction and/or deposit accumulation; and (iii) focusing more on increasing tax revenues, including through implementation of two delayed structural measures related to revenue administration (LoI, ¶3). The authorities noted, however, the expenditure rigidities implied by Sudan’s wealth-sharing protocols and the difficulty of raising domestic petroleum prices given current inflationary concerns as well as the absence of a social safety net fallback.  15.      A well targeted social safety net is needed to protect the most vulnerable from high food prices. To mitigate the impact of high world food prices on the poor, the authorities halved the effective customs duty rate and other taxes on wheat imports in February 2008. Staff concurred that the tariff reduction was an acceptable temporary mitigating response in the absence of any other available tool. However, staff stressed that blanket food (and fuel) price subsidies did not constitute an optimal response to exogenous price shocks. In particular, staff recommended a comprehensive response that should include the following features: (i) a high pass-through of world prices to domestic prices; (ii) subsidy reform to free up fiscal resources for pro-poor spending; (iii) synchronized short-term measures to protect the real incomes of the poor;7 and (iv) a targeted social safety net over the medium term that can identify, track, and reach vulnerable groups. The authorities were responsive to these recommendations and expressed strong interest in pursuing targeted schemes and requested Fund assistance in this area.  16.      The 2009 budget, which is still under preparation, envisages a cash deficit of  3-3½ percent of GDP. Oil production is budgeted to drop on account of a faster-than-expected decline in Nile Blend production, not fully compensated by rising Dar blend production. With international oil prices tapering off, oil revenues are budgeted to fall to 13 percent of GDP, 2.4 percentage points below the 2008 projected level. This decline, however, is expected to be largely offset by a rise in tax revenues (by 0.4 percent of GDP)—through a tightening of VAT exemptions, and strengthening of tax administration (LoI, ¶14); and an automatic reduction in oil-related transfers and fuel subsidy spending (by 1.8 percent of GDP). Overall, the authorities agreed that the 2009 budget will target (i) an improvement in the non-oil cash primary balance and tax revenues; (ii) a significant reduction in the remaining stock of domestic arrears inherited from 2007; (iii) higher replenishment of the oil revenue stabilization account to guard against the risk of falling oil prices and production;                                                  7 Possibilities include drawdown of strategic grain reserve; reduction of distortionary taxes/tariffs on commodities that are important in the budgets of the poor; and maintenance (delayed elimination) of price subsidies of key staples.

Staff believes that a fiscal stance guided by the above parameters is broadly appropriate, but that lower oil prices may necessitate additional measures to raise tax revenues and reduce nonpriority expenditures. In this regard, a 40 percent drop in the price of oil would increase the budget deficit by about 1 percentage point of GDP, assuming oil-related subnational transfers and implicit fuel subsidy expenditure decline commensurately.  17.      A steady improvement in the non-oil primary balance is needed over the medium term. Oil production is expected to moderate and gradually decline below current levels after 2014. Accordingly, a medium-term perspective is needed to prevent central and subnational governments from becoming excessively dependent on oil and to reduce vulnerability to oil price volatility. In particular, staff highlighted the large revenue potential of reducing tax exemptions and strengthening tax administration. Together with an automatic reduction in oil-related spending associated with the gradual decline in oil production and the elimination of domestic arrears in 2009–10, this should permit a large improvement in the non-oil primary balance in the coming years (Table 6). The authorities recognized the medium-term challenges posed by declining oil revenues and stressed that they intended to undertake a full review of the effectiveness of various government spending items (including the subsidy schemes), as well as consider deeper tax policy and administration reforms to raise non-oil revenues (see below). Large social expenditure needs that are likely to be identified in the context of the PRSP process and expected to be completed in late 2009/early 2010, lend an even greater urgency to the need to develop the revenue base. Monetary and exchange rate policies 18.      The central bank has faced several recent challenges that have complicated its  policy response. These include (i) the accumulation of domestic arrears resulting in an increase in nonperforming loans and liquidity problems leading to sharp decline in private sector credit and other monetary aggregates; (ii) the need to accumulate foreign exchange reserves following a decline in 2007 (resulting from foreign exchange sales by the central bank); and (iii) a surge in international commodity (mainly food) prices, which resulted in a  spike in inflation from October 2007 through August 2008. These challenges suggest a trade-off in conducting monetary and exchange rate policies. 19.      A cautious monetary stance will be maintained. While aware of the need to rebuild reserves, further reduce the stock of domestic arrears, and reduce nonperforming loans, the authorities stressed that it was important to have greater liquidity available to the private sector—particularly given the tight credit conditions evident in 2007 and the first half of 2008. In this context, the authorities agreed on broad money and reserve money growth targets of 21 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in 2008, lower than earlier agreed under the program (LoI, ¶7). Although credit to the nongovernment sector is expected to be lower than earlier envisaged, it should be sufficient to meet the credit requirements of the private sector as more funds are also being made available through government arrears clearance.8                                                  8 Credit expansion to nongovernment sector is now projected to be about 20 percent in 2008 compared to the SMP target of 36 percent.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  11  Beyond 2008, the monetary aggregate targets should be consistent with a return to single-digit inflation while allowing for sufficient credit to the private sector. The authorities stated that their goal is to further develop indirect monetary instruments, strengthen the inter-bank market, and improve liquidity forecasting and management. 20.      The exchange rate level appears to be broadly in equilibrium. Since January 2005, the real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by about 40 percent and (real) non-oil exports have declined by about 50 percent. The authorities and staff’s assessment is that, while the real appreciation of the exchange rate may have contributed to the weak performance of non-oil exports, supply factors have been an important factor.9 Both the macroeconomic balance and equilibrium real exchange rate approaches suggest that Sudan’s real exchange rate is returning to its equilibrium level, after a period of possible overvaluation in 2006 and the first half of 2007 (Box 2). The staff emphasized the need for continued exchange rate flexibility, in conjunction with fiscal prudence and greater use of indirect monetary policy instruments.10 The authorities agreed on the need to enhance competitiveness through measures to improve the business environment and boost productivity.  C.   Structural Reforms Fiscal reforms 21.      Fiscal reforms are critical to safeguarding macroeconomic stability. Staff highlighted the need for future fiscal reforms in the areas of fiscal transparency (including market price reporting of oil revenues and the fuel subsidy); anchoring of fiscal policy to non-oil indicators; consideration of intergenerational equity and sovereign asset-liability perspectives in managing oil wealth and public debt; elimination of the fuel subsidy in favor of a targeted cash transfer scheme; reform of the personal income tax; reduction of VAT exemptions; tax administration modernization; and fiscal decentralization (Box 3).                                                    9 Several studies (e.g., the World Bank’s Doing Business survey) highlight the difficulties with respect to transportation and trade costs, labor market rigidities, investor protection, enforcement of contracts, obtaining credit, and policies and institutions to promote exports. 10 In Sudan, a shortage is created in the foreign exchange market by surrendering the oil exports proceeds to the central bank (and not the interbank market). Subsequently, to meet the shortfall, the central bank sells foreign exchange to the interbank market.

Exchange Rate Assessment for Sudan The Sudanese pound appears close to its equilibrium level given developments in oil prices, the current account balance, and the real exchange rate. Macroeconomic balance (MB) approach. The MB approach based on the CGER panel regression indicates that Sudan’s real exchange rate is returning to its equilibrium level, after a period of possible overvaluation in 2006 and the first half of 2007. The deviation of the current account from the implied level in 2006 and the first half of 2007 was largely on account of sizeable capital inflows (which are not accounted for in the MB approach), an expansionary fiscal policy in 2006 and early 2007, and real appreciation of the pound. Since then, capital inflows appear to have decelerated, the exchange rate has become more flexible, fiscal policy has tightened, and oil prices have surged, helping the current account balance to return to the level consistent with the MB approach. -16-14-12-10-8-6-4-202001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013Implied current account balanceActual & projected current account balanceProjectionsChart 1.

There is a strong relationship between the REER and real oil prices in Sudan since the start of oil production, reflecting the large share of oil in total exports (95 percent) and in total revenues (60 percent) as well as the strong correlation between government spending and oil revenue, all of which are critical items in the equilibrium real exchange rate approach. A simple regression of the REER on real oil prices also suggests that, after temporary overvaluation—measured by the distance of the REER from the solid line in the chart below—in the second half of 2006 and the first three quarters of 2007 (related to a spike in inflation and exchange rate appreciation), the REER has shifted back toward the equilibrium level starting in the fourth quarter of 2007. This shift was facilitated by depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and higher oil prices.  8090100110120130140150160170Jan-00Jun-00Nov-00Apr-01Sep-01Feb-02Jul-02Dec-02May-03Oct-03Mar-04Aug-04Jan-05Jun-05Nov-05Apr-06Sep-06Feb-07Jul-07Dec-07May-08NEERREERRelative price indexChart 4: REER, NEER and Relative Prices(Index)y = 0.3104x + 5.0981R2 = 0.78124.54.64.74.84.95.05.15.2-1.8-1.6-1.4-1.2-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.2(Log of Oil Prices, real, US$)(Log of REER)Chart 3: Oil Prices (Real, US$) and REER, 2000-Q3 2008 (Natural Logarithm, quarterly)Q1 08Q3 08Deviation during Q3 2006-Q3 2007 Q2 2008Note: Q3 2008 is July 2008.

Structural Fiscal Reforms Going Forward Sudan has undertaken a number of important fiscal reforms in recent years, including removal of generous corporate tax holidays for investors, establishment of large and medium taxpayer offices, adoption of a new headquarters structure for the taxation chamber, launch of self-assessment by large taxpayers, implementation of a treasury single account, and adoption of the GFSM 2001 budget classification. Other important structural changes involved a step-reduction in fuel subsidies in 2006, a reduction of tariff rates on imports from major trading partners, and moves toward a federal fiscal system involving higher responsibilities to subnational governments. While these measures lay a good foundation for improved fiscal management over the medium term, there is still considerable need and scope to raise non-oil revenues. A cross-country tax survey shows Sudan’s tax effort, at 8½ percent of non-oil GDP to be low. Moreover, of the 15 countries in the survey, Sudan has the lowest corporate income tax rate (15 percent), the highest personal income tax exemption threshold (nearly 4 times per capita income), the least progressive PIT, and the lowest VAT revenue productivity (0.17).  Tax policy measures that could help include: (i) reducing VAT exemptions on capital goods (while strengthening VAT refunds), domestic utilities such as water and electricity (while introducing concessional tariffs for the poor); (ii) increasing excise duties on selected items such as cars and soft drinks to offset the effect of declining import tariffs; (iii) reducing the threshold for paying the PIT, increasing its progressivity, and removing exemptions granted to in-kind allowances and to earnings of employees above the age of 50. Considerable scope exists for strengthening revenue administration, including through completion of ongoing reforms (IT upgrade, process streamlining and making operational a new functions-based headquarters structure). In addition, efforts should focus on plugging loopholes in the taxation of the telecom sector (through the use of advanced audit software such as IDEA), and of self-employed professionals. Withholding taxes (including on imports) can serve as a useful interim device to secure revenues from potential tax evaders.  The rapid pace of fiscal decentralization since the 2005 North-South peace agreement has strained the government’s fiscal structure and given rise to transfer-dependency and expenditure quality concerns. With rising oil-related transfers, the share of own source revenues in subnational budgets has more than halved, to less than 20 percent. Most of the transfer-related spending has been devoted to current, rather than capital spending, implying a deterioration in Sudan’s net worth. The unpredictable timing of capital transfers and an overly complex horizontal allocation formula for the North, as well as acute tax administration weaknesses in the South have added to the difficulties. There are also tensions over sharing with subnational governments the costs of the fuel subsidy and tax administration (currently borne asymmetrically by the central government). Going forward, it will be important to clarify revenue-expenditure assignments between various governmental layers, report the full cost of the fuel subsidy (including by reporting oil revenues at market prices), extend PFM reforms to subnational governments, and institute a functional classification of subnational spending.    Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public14 22.      The authorities concurred with the thrust of the proposals and identified reform priorities. They indicated that an internal review of various tax exemptions and subsidy schemes was being undertaken in the context of the 2009 budget. Specifically, a number of possible tax policy reforms are under consideration, including: reducing VAT exemptions with a view to capping the share of VAT-exempt imports (currently 65 percent) to no more than 40 percent of total imports; and applying a minimum import tariff of 3 percent to about half of all customs duty-exempt imports (LoI, ¶14). In the area of tax administration, the authorities intend to commence, before year-end, risk-based joint income tax/VAT post-audits of at least 20 self-assessed corporate tax returns submitted earlier this year  (LoI, ¶11-12). 23.      Plans to launch an ambitious second round of PFM reforms were unveiled. These reforms are expected to cover medium-term budget planning, finance ministry reorganization, and PFM reforms extension to the general government (LoI, ¶15). The authorities are also considering setting up a dedicated GFS unit in the finance ministry to liaise with other government statistical units and pioneer the extension of GFSM 2001 to the Northern states and various government funds and universities (LoI, ¶16). Developing and strengthening the financial system 24.      Continuation of financial sector reforms will be necessary to strengthen and further develop the financial sector. While some progress has been made, Sudan’s financial system remains relatively underdeveloped. The authorities recognize the need to further strengthen prudential supervision and inspection to ensure full compliance with prudential regulations and to address the NPL problem. Over the medium term, a range of reforms are needed to achieve a more efficient channeling of savings to investment (Box 4). Regarding specific actions for 2009, the authorities are preparing a plan to restructure/privatize Omdurman Bank. The details of the plan and any associated costs will be based on the findings of the recently completed independent audit of the bank (LoI, ¶17). Also, the CBS intends to strengthen commercial banks’ compliance with the supervisory regulations, including by expediting enforcement of corrective actions when banks fall short of meeting the prudential requirement. Finally, a draft anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism law was recently submitted to the Cabinet for approval. D.   External Debt and Relations with Creditors 25.      Sudan’s external debt overhang remains a serious concern. The end-2007 stock of public and publicly-guaranteed debt is estimated at US$31.9 billion in nominal terms, up by about US$13 billion since end-2000. The bulk of the increase reflects primarily a further buildup of interest arrears (approximately US$8 billion) to Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors. It also includes new drawings of some US$1.5 billion from Arab multilateral and bilateral creditors, as well as from China and India. In NPV terms, the end-2008 stock of external debt is projected to be equivalent to roughly 53 percent of GDP and 230 percent of exports. The authorities expressed concern that, after nearly a decade of cooperation on policies and payments, no concrete progress has been made on alleviating Sudan’s external   Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  15  debt burden, severely limiting Sudan’s prospects for meeting the Millennium Development  Goals (MDGs).

Financial Sector Soundness and Development Financial sector indicators have deteriorated in recent years. Although banks’ capitalization levels remain well above statutory requirements, nonperforming assets have increased significantly while provisioning has deteriorated. To improve the health of the financial system, the CBS needs to further strengthen supervision and inspection, improve the legal and regulatory framework, and promote greater transparency. Adoption of international accounting and audit standards by all financial institutions will promote reliable information and more prudent investment, credit, and other financial decisions.  Financial depth indicators are relatively low, mainly due to the lack of competition. The dominance of public sector banks, most notably Omdurman Bank, has hindered competition and market development as well as created rigidities that have kept profitability indicators higher than in other economies. To resolve these problems, market forces must be allowed to operate freely and restrictions abolished. Over the medium and long term, there are a range of reforms that Sudan would need to undertake to achieve a more efficient channeling of savings to investments. These include modernizing the insurance sector, broadening securities markets, and developing microfinance institutions to self sustaining level. Although the nonbank financial sector’s exposure to risk is relatively small, its expansion should be accompanied by the establishment of an appropriate prudential framework and the development of supervisory skills specific to the sector. 26.      A debt sustainability analysis (DSA) based on the joint Bank-Fund Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework was prepared and discussed with the authorities. The results for the baseline scenario suggest that, even assuming prudent macroeconomic policies, most of Sudan’s debt ratios remain above the indicative thresholds for sustainability (see EBS/08/120, Supplement II). Moreover, with its heavy reliance on oil, Sudan is highly vulnerable to both oil production and price shocks. The authorities concurred with the assessment, noting that it strengthens the case for debt relief.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  16  27.      The authorities are aware of the importance to minimize nonconcessional borrowing. They emphasized that contracting of such loans had been limited in recent years and were generally tied to specific development projects. The authorities, however, argued that the lack of access to more traditional forms of concessional finance and pressing development needs associated with the various peace agreements left nonconcessional borrowing as a necessity. They intend to limit contracting of such borrowing to US$700 million in 2008 (LoI, ¶18). 28.      The authorities do not see the current approach of token payments to the Fund as a solution to the arrears issue. Resolving Sudan’s overdue financial obligations remains a high priority for the government. The authorities intend to pay the Fund at least US$50 million in 2008 (LoI, ¶18) but reiterated that such payments are not a meaningful solution to Sudan’s obligations to the Fund (LoI, ¶19). To this end, the authorities believe that debt relief under HIPC and MDRI initiatives will play a crucial role in helping Sudan to improve its relations with the Fund and other multilateral and bilateral donors. IV.   DATA ISSUES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE 29.      Sudan’s economic data are sufficient for surveillance and program monitoring, but need further improvement. The quality of Sudan’s economic data has improved in recent years—in part because of participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System. Monetary and financial sector statistics are comprehensive and generally timely, and information on oil production, shipments, pricing, and transfers of revenue are available. Significant progress is also being made on fiscal reporting helped by the adoption of GFSM 2001 classification for the 2008 budget. Recently established domestic debt unit will help preparation of regular data on domestic debt and arrears. While considerable improvement has been made in the CPI by expanding its coverage and using new weights in the basket, national accounts data need further improvements.  20072008 1/Total amount of loans contracted339944Concessional loans194679of which: bilateral12410non-bilateral 2/70669Non-concessional loans145265of which: bilateral055non-bilateral 2/145210of which: Islamic bonds01001/ From January to August 2008.2/ Includes regional development funds (Saudi Fund, Kuwait Fund, Abu Dhabi Fund, Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and OPEC).Sudan: Contracting of External Loans, 2007 and 2008(Millions of U.S. dollar)30.      The authorities place high weight on continued technical assistance from the Fund. Priorities for the short term include further training on GFSM 2001 methodology, tax and customs administration, extension of PFM reforms to general government, multi-year budget planning, fiscal federalism, development of indirect monetary instruments, and bank supervision. Although the Fund has provided technical assistance to the South in the areas of currency exchange and supervision of conventional banking systems, the authorities requested more active engagement of the Fund in South Sudan. The authorities also reiterated their desire for an FSAP update as soon as possible.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  17  V.   STAFF APPRAISAL 31.      Sudan has implemented important reforms under the 2007–08 SMP. In particular, important steps were taken to rein in tax exemptions, widen the tax base, and improve tax administration. Moreover, several key financial management reforms (such as establishing a centralized debt unit and commitment controls to limit expenditures by budget units) were recently implemented, though with a delay that contributed to the accumulation of domestic arrears in 2007. 32.      Nevertheless, the challenges facing Sudan remain immense and complex. Sudan must continue to balance volatile oil revenues against its fiscal obligations associated with the peace agreements and the need to pay down domestic arrears and build up reserves. Higher food prices are meanwhile putting pressures on inflation and impacting the most vulnerable segments of the population. In the medium term, Sudan needs to strengthen its revenue and non-oil export base and develop its financial system to sustain strong growth.  33.      It will be critical to adopt a prudent 2009 budget, particularly in light of the recent volatility in world oil prices.11 Staff supports the authorities’ intention to significantly reduce the stock of domestic arrears. These arrears have undermined corporate and bank liquidity and inhibited private sector growth. Staff also welcomes the intention to further replenish the oil stabilization account to guard against the risk of falling oil prices and production. Staff encourages the authorities, however, to gradually reduce the fuel subsidy in favor of a targeted safety net to protect the poor from higher food and fuel prices; a blanket fuel subsidy and trade measures introduced to keep food prices down are not a substitute for a targeted transfer system. 34.      It will also be necessary to aim for a steady improvement in the non-oil primary balance. A medium-term fiscal perspective is needed to prevent central and subnational governments from becoming excessively dependent on oil-related transfers, which are vulnerable to both production and price volatility. This is particularly important, given the peace related expenditure pressures and the expected drop in oil production over the medium term.   35.      A cautious monetary stance needs to be maintained to keep inflationary pressures in check. Monetary aggregates have remained within program targets. There are, nevertheless, two broad risks to inflation, one from the supply side stemming from higher commodity (notably food) prices and the other from the demand side associated with the reduction of domestic arrears. It will be important to closely monitor price developments; improve coordination between the central bank and the finance ministry on the timing and                                                  11 In this regard, it may be worth noting that the sizeable accumulation of domestic arrears in 2006–07 were partly the result of lower-than-budgeted oil revenues that were not offset by cuts in expenditures.

The staff’s assessment is that the exchange rate level is broadly in equilibrium. While the real appreciation of the exchange rate since January 2005 may have contributed to the weak performance of non-oil exports, the authorities and staff agree that structural bottlenecks have been an important factor. It will be important to enhance competition through measures to improve the business environment and boost productivity. These include addressing shortcomings related to labor market rigidities, investor protection, enforcement of contracts, and obtaining credit. It is noteworthy that the authorities have identified these same shortcomings in the context of their initiative to promote the agricultural sector. Greater exchange rate flexibility, in conjunction with fiscal prudence, is also needed to buffer the economy from external shocks and protect reserves. 37.      Fiscal reforms are critical to maintain macroeconomic stability and sustain strong growth over the medium term. Peace-related subnational transfers as well as higher capital spending needed to deliver the much anticipated peace dividend have contributed to a deterioration in non-oil fiscal indicators in recent years. There is an urgent need to increase tax revenues, which are low, compared to countries at a similar level of development. In the area of tax policy, exemptions should be reduced. Simply put, there are too many sectors and goods that are exempt from taxes, especially VAT. Moreover, the personal income tax must be reformed by lowering the payment threshold, and bringing into the tax net in-kind allowances and incomes earned by persons over the age of 50. In the area of tax administration, the authorities need to expedite key ongoing reforms, especially the introduction of self-assessment and the reorganization and modernization of the taxation chamber. Staff estimates suggest that improvements in tax administration alone could yield additional revenues in the order of 2 percent of GDP over the medium term. 38.      Fiscal federalism has made it more challenging to maintain macroeconomic stability. Federalism has the potential to better allocate scarce resources and to meaningfully contribute to reducing poverty and inequality—which are clearly necessary in Sudan. It will be important, however, to minimize the risks of transfer dependency, establish appropriate incentives for subnational governments to collect own-source revenues, and considerably strengthen public financial management systems at state and local government levels to assure quality spending. 39.      Financial sector vulnerabilities need to be addressed. The problems of Omdurman Bank are symptomatic of fundamental challenges affecting the banking sector. They reveal the need to strengthen supervision and bank inspection to ensure full compliance with good international standards. Prompt corrective actions are needed when banks fall short of                                                  12 The demand injection corresponding to any arrears clearance from excess oil revenues is likely to be much larger than the amounts cleared since a drawdown from the oil revenue stabilization account triggers large automatic transfers to subnational governments.

Credit information bureaus and greater corporate transparency are also needed to improve lending decisions.   40.      Sudan is in debt distress and its debt problem continues to constrain access to external development finance. Sudan’s record of cooperation on economic policies and payments to the Fund augur well for the clearance of Sudan’s arrears at the appropriate time. In the meantime, the authorities should minimize to the extent possible the contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional debt, because such borrowing weakens debt sustainability and could further delay the process of securing creditors’ participation in a potential debt relief operation. Staff also urges the authorities to make payments to the Fund on a more regular basis to meet the US$50 million target for 2008. 41.      The staff believes that the program continues to meet the standard of upper-credit-tranche conditionality, except for the proposed level of nonconcessional borrowing. The SMP is a valuable tool to support reform momentum. It contains important actions to maintain fiscal discipline and promote financial sector development. It provides a framework within which donors can support the peace process and afflicted areas.  42.      While Sudan’s economic prospects are good, important risks exist. The main risk remains a weakening of political resolve to maintain macroeconomic stability and advance critical reforms. There are legislative and presidential elections in 2009 and a referendum in 2011 in the South on possible succession. While the global financial crisis is unlikely to have a direct bearing on Sudan, given the size of its banking sector in the economy, it may have an indirect impact by reducing the world price of oil as well as the flow of investment and remittances. This reinforces the need to maintain prudent policies and move ahead with structural reforms to sustain growth. Indeed, if oil prices continue to decline, it will be necessary to implement additional revenue-generating measures and expenditure cuts to ensure a fiscal stance that is consistent with macroeconomic stability. 43.      It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Sudan be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Washington, D.C. 20431  Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:  1.      In June 2007, we negotiated an 18-month Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) with IMF staff for the period July 2007 through December 2008. Notwithstanding difficult circumstances, much has been accomplished during this period. Pressing expenditure needs engendered under our peace agreements along with volatility in oil revenues complicated macroeconomic management and contributed to the accumulation of domestic arrears. Still, we have taken decisive actions to reduce these arrears and stop new accumulation, including by implementing important expenditure control measures and adopting the GFSM 2001 framework for the 2008 budget. Bold steps were also made with respect to reining in tax exemptions, widening the tax base, and improving tax administration. As a result, we have been able to preserve macroeconomic stability and maintain strong economic growth. 2.      Performance under the SMP has improved. We are pleased to inform you that all but one of the quantitative targets set for June 2008 were observed. In particular, the ceilings on net domestic assets of the Bank of Sudan and on domestic financing of the central government, as well as the floors on net international reserves and on the reduction in the stock of domestic arrears were met by comfortable margins. We have also repaid the Fund US$18.3 million in the first half of the year, short of the US$25 million target, although we have subsequently accelerated our payments, and will meet the end-2008 target of US$50 million.  3.      We have met two of the four structural measures set for June 2008. In particular, we have (i) required remaining problem banks to submit a time-bound action plan to accumulate sufficient provisioning to reduce net nonperforming loans; and (ii) shared with IMF staff a risk-based audit strategy providing for comprehensive joint income tax-VAT post audits of self-assessed corporate tax returns. We will, before end-year, submit to parliament a modified Customs Law that provides valuation guidelines for questionable assessments, which has already been approved by the Council of Ministers and is currently being vetted by the Ministry of Justice. We will also extend (before end-year) Tax Identification Numbers (TIN), already in place by the tax offices, to the customs agency.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  33  4.      Our most immediate challenge is to avoid high inflation becoming entrenched, putting at risk the gains from our earlier policies, and to protect the most vulnerable from high food prices. Over the past nine months or so, Sudan, like many other countries, has been adversely affected by the sharp rise in international food prices. This has resulted in an acceleration of inflation, to 13.7 percent by end-September 2008—and has particularly impacted the poor. The increase in inflation has so far been largely due to external price increases (mainly wheat) as the rate of inflation excluding food has been modest. The new CPI, which was released in September and which covers rural areas for the first time, suggests that high imported food price has affected rural areas more than urban areas. We are determined to contain the second round effects and to avoid price expectations being adjusted upward. We, therefore, are closely watching the current imported price inflation developments and will take necessary steps to minimize its negative welfare effects. We have already halved the effective import duty rate on wheat in February 2008. We now expect end-of period inflation to be 12 percent in 2008, assuming that international food prices fall as expected in the last quarter of 2008.  5.      Notwithstanding a surge in food and fuel imports and weak capital inflows, strong oil export performance, resulting from a sharp increase in international oil prices, has supported the balance of payments during 2008. The increase in export receipts is expected to contribute to nearly halving of the current account deficit to 6 percent of GDP, down from 12 percent in 2007, assuming that world oil prices do not substantially decline below current levels. At end-2008, gross international reserves are estimated to rise to nearly 2 months of imports. 6.      We have prepared a comprehensive plan to boost non-oil production by utilizing untapped resources of the country. The main focus is on development of the agriculture sector with the help of strategic foreign partners. The plan includes easing structural rigidities, removing distortions, liberalizing investment policies and the labor market, reducing cost of doing business, reforming the legal system, providing necessary infrastructure, and improving the business environment. 7.      To achieve macroeconomic stability, the Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) is targeting a broad money growth rate of 21 percent and reserve money growth rate of 20 percent in 2008—consistent with our GDP growth and inflation objectives, and an increase in money demand reflecting the reintegration of the South. We will closely monitor monetary developments to ensure that broad money growth remains in line with the revised inflation target. We note, however, that the impact of monetary policy is limited given that most of the inflation is imported. The exchange rate will be allowed to move in line with fundamentals and foreign exchange interventions will focus primarily on smoothing lumpy payments and serving government needs. However, in light of the need to rebuild foreign exchange reserves to prudent levels, the central bank will avoid resisting sustained pressures on the pound.

It will strike a balance between reducing inflation on the one hand, and protecting economic growth in the face of increased downside risks related to oil revenues and mitigating the effects of higher price levels on the poor on the other hand. 9.      Fiscal performance in 2008 has been good, aided by higher oil revenues in the first half of the year and the limiting of expenditure to budgetary ceilings. The cash balance, savings in the oil revenue stabilization account (OSA), and arrears clearance are projected to be in line with or higher than programmed. Commitment controls have considerably strengthened; there has been no new arrears accumulation and, as noted above, a substantial reduction in the existing stock of arrears. Higher oil revenues, however, have necessitated offsetting increases in expenditures related to oil transfers and the fuel subsidy. While we are aware of the slow execution rate for national and subnational capital expenditures, these should pick-up in the remainder of the year, facilitated by the increased availability of domestic and foreign resources. 10.      The adoption at the beginning of this year of the GFSM 2001 system for budgetary reporting has improved our ability to monitor domestic arrears and track domestic financing. Domestic debt reporting is also expected to be strengthened considerably by the recent establishment of an operational domestic debt unit. Starting December 2008, this unit will prepare detailed monthly domestic debt reports. These reports will serve as a vital input for monthly budget execution reporting. We also expect to resolve, by year-end, software problems experienced earlier with implementation of the zero balance feature of the Treasury Single Account (TSA). 11.      On tax administration, the introduction of self-assessment marks the beginning of a new era of mutual trust and cooperation between taxpayers and the government. In the remaining months of 2008, we intend to consolidate this relationship by (i) operationalizing the recently approved functions-based headquarters structure of the taxation chamber; (ii) developing an IT strategy that can serve clearly defined short- and long-run objectives of a modern tax chamber; (iii) submitting legislation to parliament to modernize customs through the adoption of WTO guidelines on suspect valuations, simplified and effective appeals procedures, and measures aimed at reducing clearing times for exporters and importers.  12.      We recognize, however, that the above measures will not be enough to raise the revenue yield, unless supplemented by serious efforts to improve tax compliance. To this end, we intend to commence, before year-end, risk-based joint income tax/VAT post-audits of at least 20 self-assessed corporate tax returns submitted earlier this year; a plan for these audits has already been shared with staff.  13.      The 2009 budget is still under preparation and remains subject to the evolving outlook  on world oil prices. However, we will be guided by the following broad parameters:  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  35  (i) an overall deficit of 3 - 3½ percent of GDP;1 (ii) an improvement in the non-oil cash primary balance and tax revenues; (iii) further reduction in the remaining stock of domestic arrears inherited from 2007; (iv) a prudent level of OSA accumulation to guard against the risk of falling oil prices or production; (v) an increase in capital expenditures on priority social and infrastructure projects; and (vi) limiting the size of the fuel subsidy and/or looking into the possibility of sharing with subnational governments the fuel subsidy burden, presently borne mainly by the central government. 14.      Building on recent measures to raise revenues, we are considering a number of possible tax policy reforms, including: reducing VAT exemptions with a view to capping the share of VAT exempt-imports (currently 65 percent) to no more than 40 percent of total imports; and applying a minimum import tariff of 3 percent to about half of all customs-duty exempt imports. The timing, sequencing, nature and extent of these measures are, of course, still under discussion. 15.      We are committed to wide-ranging Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms for the general government, covering the GNU and the Government of Southern Sudan, various government-owned funds and universities, as well as Northern state treasuries to improve the quality of budget preparation and execution. We request the IMF to provide technical assistance in this area in 2009, including a visit to the South.  16.      The introduction of the GFSM 2001 system has highlighted the need to strengthen our statistical systems. In this context, we intend to set up a GFS unit in the Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MOFNE) that will both liaise on statistical issues with the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) and the CBOS, as well as pioneer the extension of GFSM 2001 to the Northern states with a view to facilitating functional reporting of state-level expenditure. We are also considering changing the reporting basis of oil revenues to market prices rather than budget prices, in line with GFSM 2001 conventions.  17.      Much progress has been made in strengthening the financial sector. We have required problem banks to submit a time-bound action plan to accumulate sufficient provisions to reduce net nonperforming loans and to raise their capital adequacy to meet existing prudential standards. These reforms have already translated to an improvement in financial sector indicators. The NPLs have declined to 18 percent at end-June 2008 from 22 percent at end-2007 while provisioning has increased to 21 percent from 15 percent during the same period. Importantly, the independent audit of Omdurman Bank has now been completed. We will now prepare, by end-March 2009, a restructuring/privatizing plan for the bank based on the results of the audit. We also intend to strengthen commercial banks’ compliance with the                                                  1 This is based on oil revenues and fuel subsidy evaluated at budget prices, and expenditures excluding the clearance of domestic arrears.

We remain committed to limiting the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional borrowing to US$700 million in 2008. To demonstrate our continued cooperation, we will make payments to the IMF of at least US$50 million in 2008.  19.      We would hasten to point out, however, that these payments—while demonstrating our good intentions—are not a solution to Sudan’s arrears to the IMF. We ask the international community in this context to recognize our accomplishments, act in accordance with the principle of equality of  treatment, and work toward a rapid resolution of Sudan’s external debt and arrears problem. We hope to see progress in this area before end-2008. 20.      We believe that with these policies we will be able to achieve our objectives, but we are ready to take any additional measures. In this regard, we will maintain a close dialogue with IMF staff and look forward to our continued close cooperation with the IMF, including by negotiating a new SMP in 2009. We agree to publication on the IMF’s website of the staff report, the Public Information Notice, and this letter.

SUDAN—DRAFT PUBLIC INFORMATION NOTICE   International Monetary Fund 700 19th Street, NW Washington, D. C. 20431 USA  Public Information Notice (PIN) No.   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE November [], 2008    IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Sudan    On November [26], 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Sudan.1  Background  Economic growth in 2007 and in the first half of 2008 remained strong. Overall real GDP growth is projected to be 8½ percent in 2008 with non-oil growth at about 10 percent. A slight drop in oil output in 2008 was more than offset by the continued growth in services, which has become the engine of growth in Sudan. Inflation meanwhile rose from 9 percent at end-2007 to 14 percent by end-September 2008, driven almost entirely by a rise in world food prices.  The fiscal position has improved following difficulties in 2007due to higher oil revenues and improved expenditure controls. Oil revenues were 1 percent higher than expected in the first half of 2008 mainly due to higher oil prices. Although non-oil revenues were relatively weak, cash expenditures (excluding on the fuel subsidy and on oil related transfers to the South) remained within target limits despite clearance of arrears inherited from 2007. Overall, the 2008 fiscal deficit (on a cash basis) is expected to decline to 2.8 percent from 3.1 percent of GDP in 2007.                                                   1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

This likely reflects the clearance of domestic arrears accumulated in 2007 which was the main source of slowdown in private sector credit and other monetary aggregates. Twelve-month reserve money and broad money are projected to increase by 21 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in 2008 compared to 12.8 percent and 10.3 percent in 2007. Credit to the private sector remains weak, however, reflecting lower demand and the time lag of arrears clearance on the economy. The external current account improved in the first half of 2008, due mostly to higher oil exports receipts. Oil exports more than doubled in dollar terms reflecting a surge in oil prices in the first half of 2008. Non-oil exports, however, remained weak because of problems in sesame and livestock exports. Imports growth was also slow, reflecting a fall in imports of machinery and transport equipment due mainly to the credit squeeze caused by accumulation of domestic arrears. The overall current account deficit is expected to be about 5 percent of GDP in 2008, compared with 11 percent in 2007. Higher oil prices and exchange rate flexibility facilitated a rise in net international reserves of the central bank to US$1.8 billion by end-August 2008. The Sudanese pound has depreciated by about 7 percent and 20 percent vis-à-vis the dollar and euro, respectively since September 2007. Important structural reforms were completed in 2007–08. In particular, important steps were taken to rein in tax exemptions, widen the tax base, and improve tax administration. Moreover, several key financial management reforms, including preparation of 2008 budget in GFSM 2001 format, were also implemented. In addition, effective establishment of a centralized debt unit and the implementation of expenditure commitment controls were recently implemented.
