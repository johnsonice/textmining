Introduction A staff team’ held the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Maldives in Male during March 18-April 1, 1995. The Maldivian delegation was led by Mr. Arif Hilmy, Minister of State for Finance and Treasury (MOFT) and Vice Governor of the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), and included the Ministers of Planning, Human Resources, and Environment; Trade and Industries; Foreign AfXairs; Tourism; Fisheries and Agriculture; Transport and Communications, the General Manager of the MMA, and other officials. Meetings were also held at selected public enterprises, commercial banks, and business organizations. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on May 6, 1994, Executive Directors noted with concern the deterioration in the economic performance since the early 1990s. A growing fiscal deficit financed in large part by government borrowing from the MMA had led to worsening financial imbalances, undermining economic growth prospects. Directors called for decisive fiscal adjustment, tightened monetary management, a more realistic exchange rate policy, and structural reforms to encourage private sector activity. Maldives maintains an exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2 (a) arising from a combination of government policies that result in the nonavailability of foreign exchange on a timely basis for current international transactions. The restriction has not been approved. Maldives continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under the provisions of Article XIV, but no longer maintains restrictions under Article XIV. II. Background Maldives is an archipelago of about 1,190 small coral islands, of which about 200 are inhabited. The population has grown at an annual rate of about 3.2 percent in recent years, reaching an estimated 246,000 in 1994. The economy relies heavily on fisheries and tourism, which together account for about 30 percent of GDP and two thirds of foreign exchange earnings. Following a period of strong economic performance in the late 198Os, a rising budget deficit, coupled with a deteriorating external environment, led to growing financial imbalances in the earlv 1990s (Tables 1 and 2, and Chart I). With a large share of the budget deficit financed through government borrowing from the MMA, monetary and credit aggregates expanded rapidly (Table 3). While the rufiyaa remained on a managed float, the low level of reserves initially restrained recourse to official intervention, and the nominal effective exchange rate depreciated markedly during 1990-92, although the impact on the real effective ‘Messrs. Molho (Head), Cangiano, Stankovski, and Miss Cullati (Administrative Assistant) (all SEA). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- exchange rate was largely offset by rising inflation (Chart 2). Following recourse to an external, medium-term commercial loan by the MMA in February 1993, there were increasing net sales of foreign exchange through the MMA’s Government Exchange Counter (GEC) and the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was stabilized vis-A-vis the U.S. dollar. However, inflation rose to 20 percent in 1993, and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 14 percent, while foreign exchange earnings were depressed by an extended slump in international tuna prices and economic recession in major tourist markets (Table 4). As the overall balance of payments shifted into a large deficit, net foreign assets declined to an uncomfortably low level, and tight limits were imposed on the availability of foreign exchange through the GEC.’ A. Developments During 1994 Macroeconomic Performance began to improve in 1994, reflecting, in part, a more favorable extemai environment. Real GDP expanded by 6 l/2 percent, as both the fisheries and tourism sectors recovered strongly. Canned tuna exports performed particularly well, reflecting increasing international prices and a more flexible policy in the setting of procurement prices by the Maldives Industrial Fisheries Company (MIFCO), which allowed it to compete more effectively with private sector exporters. Tourist arrivals were spurred by the recovery of European economies and the establishment of air connections with new tourist markets. The external current account deficit narrowed from 21 l/2 percent of GDP in 1993 to 6 percent of GDP in 1994 and the balance of payments shifted into a surplus. Progress in reducing domestic resource pressures was modest, however, with the rate of inflation remaining relatively high at an estimated 16 l/2 percent. On the policy front, fiscal consolidation made a substantial contribution to the turnaround in the external accounts. Tax receipts were higher than budgeted owing to the good performance of the tourism sector, while nontax revenues were boosted by the collection of arrears on resort lease rents and onetime transfers of profits from public enterprises. Although civil service wages were raised by lo-30 percent as of September 1994, current expenditure was restrained to the initially budgeted amount by a hiring freeze, except for teachers and doctors, and by reduced outlays for travel, supplies, and repairs and maintenance. Nonessential investment projects were postponed, and strong efforts were made to collect past due loans from public enterprises. The overall budget deficit fell from 16 percent of GDP in 1993 to 6 ‘A percent of GDP in 1994, with its domestic financing declining to 3 1% percent of GDP or about half the initial budget target. Monetarv policv was tightened in early 1994, but credit conditions eased again in the latter part of the year. Following the sharp expansion of monetary and credit aggregates ‘These limits, in conjunction with other regulations that discourage foreign exchange trading outside the MMA, have been found to constitute an exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII. For more details on the exchange system, see “Maldives--Recent Economic Developments” (SM./94/99, 4/12/94), pp. 25-26. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- recorded in 1993, credit to the private sector actually declined in nominal terms during the first half of 1994. However, the large stock of excess bank reserves, in conjunction with a clearing of the backlog of MMA approvals on pending loan applications, led to a pickup of credit growth in the second half of the year. The year-on-year rate of growth of credit to the private sector declined to 12 percent by June 1994, before rising to 27 percent at end-1994. With the legal ceiling on domestic interest rates remaining set at 5 percentage points above the New York Prime Rate, commercial banks raised their loan rates broadly in line with U.S. interest rates, but rufiyaa deposit and loan rates remained negative in real terms. While foreign exchange sales through the GEC continued to be restrained, the exchange m was gradually depreciated beginning in March 1994, before being stabilized again vis-a- vis the U.S. dollar in October 1994. The nominal effective exchange rate depreciated by 11 percent between end-1993 and end-1994, and the real effective exchange rate appreciated modestly. With surging fiscal receipts from the tourism sector (which are payable in U.S. dollars), the MMA’s reserves increased to two months of imports by year-end. B. Developments in Early 1995 Inflationarv nressures were aggravated in early 1995 following large increases in food prices. These increases were due partly to a temporary decline in the fish catch, which led to a shortage of fresh fish in the Male market, but demand pressures were also spurred by a further pickun in the growth of credit to the private sector. Official reserves continued to increase during the first quarter of 1995, buoyed by the seasonal peak in receipts from tourism. However, the prosnects for export earnings were weakened following a renewed decline in international tuna prices. Owing to the accumulation of large stocks in export markets, exports of frozen fish are expected to remain depressed through the first half of 1995. III. Report on the Discussions The discussions focused on the need to strengthen the stabilization policies initiated in 1994 while implementing a more comprehensive program of structural reform to place the economy on a path of sustainable growth. The key policy objectives were discussed in the context of the staffs medium-term macroeconomic framework. In the short run, the need to rapidly reduce the rate of inflation and consolidate the recent improvement in the external accounts calls for stronger efforts to restrain public expenditure and tighten monetary policy. Over the medium term, with the volume of aid-financed public investment expected to level off, the main challenges will be to foster domestic saving and investment so as to sustain an adequate rate of economic growth while maintaining a viable external position. To these ends, stabilization policies will need to be supported by reforms in the tax system, the financial sector, the exchange and trade system, public enterprises, and the regulatory environment.

While revenue performance would weaken somewhat following the previous year’s extraordinary increase in transfers from public enterprises, current expenditure would decline by ‘/z percentage point of GDP. Domestically financed capital expenditure would decline more significantly, although not to a sufficient extent to offset a projected increase in foreign-funded investment related to the implementation of two major fisheries projects. While the domestic financing of the deficit would be reduced to 2 percent of GDP, the overall deficit would widen to 11 percent of GDP. The staff team pointed out that the measures envisaged in the 1995 budnet, though hinhlv welcome, were likelv to be insufficient to ease demand pressures and redress the structural fiscal imbalance. The overall deficit is projected to increase by some 4 percentage points of GDP in 1995. Although the increase in the foreign-financed portion of the deficit would probably be channeled largely into imports, it was likely to exert some pressure on domestic resources, which would tend to offset the effects of the budgeted decline in the domestic financing of the deficit. In addition, there are risks of slippage in budget implementation, stemming from the weakening finances of key public enterprises, possible cost overruns in social expenditures, and pent-up demand for public services following the budget cuts of the last year. To bring fiscal policy back on a path of decisive adjustment and prevent a crowding out of credit to the private sector (see below), the staff encouraged the authorities to aim, at a minimum, to eliminate the domestic financing of the deficit in 1995. Given the limited scope for raising additional revenues in the short run, the mission called for earlv action to meet reduced exnenditure targets for 1995. While public wages are not budgeted to increase following the raises granted last September, personnel costs should be kept below the appropriated amount by freezing government employment. Vacancies in expanding sectors should thus be filled only if offset by reductions in lower-priority sectors. The authorities noted that it should also be possible to keep capital expenditure below the level appropriated in the budget, by barring the initiation of domestically financed projects while strengthening efforts to mobilize foreign assistance or private financing for high-priority investment. In this connection, the mission was informed that the recent negotiations on IDA’s Second Education and Training Project, and on a joint-venture agreement with foreign parties for the provision of water and sewerage services to the island of Male, had been successfUlly concluded. To lower the risk of slippages in budget implementation, the authorities were encouraged to tighten procedures for in-year increases in appropriations with the assistance of the FAD resident advisor. The discussions recognized that, over the medium term. a higher level of public savings would be necessarv to ensure external stability and meet basic Dublic investment needs. Although the imbalances of the early 1990s were, to a large extent, attributable to declining government savings, the brunt of the adjustment had, so far, fallen on public investment. The recent and prospective compression of domestically financed capital expenditure was, to some extent, being offset by rising foreign aid inflows. But these inflows are projected to level off Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- over the medium term, making it difficult to sustain the recent pattern of financing. To make room for an adequate level of public investment, the staff team underscored the importance of maintaining tight control over civil service wage increases, extending the freeze on public employment, and expanding cost recovery in the provision of public services. The authorities agreed with the need to contain personnel outlays and pointed out that cost recovery schemes are already in place in the health sector, while strategies for the introduction of cost recovery in government-owned schools are to be developed under the IDA-supported Second Education and Training Project. With the existing tax system basically relying on customs duties and levies on tourism, the authorities see an urgent need to broaden the tax base. The new Export-Import Law that came into effect in 1994, which curbed personal exemptions and concentrated most tariffs in a relatively narrow range (5-35 percent), appears to have been revenue neutral. The recent harmonization of lease terms for tourist resorts will progressively raise lease rents on private resorts toward the levels prevailing for government-owned resorts, thereby offsetting the expected waning of receipts from arrears on land lease rents. The authorities are also considering ways to curb remaining exemptions from customs duties and replace the flat bed- night tax on tourism with a higher-yielding progressive tax based on resorts’ listed room rates. However, to ensure that the tourism sector does not bear an unfairly heavy tax burden, these measures are to be introduced only as a part of a tax reform nackage, which would include a business turnover tax and a nonresidential real estate tax. The authorities have requested technical assistance from FAD to help develop their ability to implement and administer the planned business turnover tax. B. Monetary Policy and Financial Reform The authorities are concerned by the recent reacceleration of credit growth and recognize the need for a decisive tightening of monetarv nolicv. To help lower inflation to single digits in 1995, the staff team proposed a monetary program targeting a decline of the year-on-year rate of growth of broad money from 25 percent in March 1995 to 11 percent by year-end. Assuming that there is no net government borrowing from the banking system, and that credit to public enterprises is strictly limited, there would be enough room for a continuing accumulation of oficial reserves and a healthy expansion of credit to the private sector. However, the rate of growth of credit to the private sector would have to decline from an annual rate of more than 50 percent in the first quarter of 1995 to 17 percent over the full year. The authorities agreed with the broad objectives of the proposed monetary program. However, in the absence of nonbank sources of finance, there were concerns that an excessive slowdown of credit growth might undermine productive investment. The authorities are aware that it would be difficult to effect the required tightening and encourage financial savitlgs under the current system of monetarv management. Since 1993, the required reserve ratio (35 percent on both rufiyaa and foreign currency deposits) and the credit-to-deposit ratio (60 percent for rufiyaa loans and 150 percent for foreign currency loans) have tended to be nonbinding and the MMA has attempted to slow credit growth by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- withholding approval of large-size loans3 However, this has helped generate a large stock of excess bank reserves (3 1 % percent of rufiyaa deposits and 8 percent of foreign currency deposits as of end-1994) and has, in practice, tended to delay rather than restrain overall credit growth. At the same time, the lack of transparency in the process of loan-by-loan approval has engendered uncertainty about the direction of credit policies while the combination of loan rate ceilings and high intermediation costs has made banks unwilling to accept interest-bearing rufiyaa deposits and encouraged increasing currency substitution (Chart 3). With the help of an MAE expert, efforts are under way to institute a more effective monetary policy. Legislation for the introduction of treasury bills is to be submitted to Parliament in the second half of 1995. Pending approval of that legislation, the MMA intends to begin issuing its own debt certificates, with a view to absorbing the existing stock of excess bank liquidity. The authorities also plan to abolish the credit-to-deposit ratio and the loan approval requirement and to institute a more transparent system of bank-specific aggregate credit ceilings as a transitional measure. The staff emphasized the need to accompany the planned actions with a liberalization of commercial bank loan rates, especially on rufiyaa operations, which still carry negative real interest rates. To limit distortions in intermediation margins and restore the attractiveness of rufiyaa deposits, it will also be important to introduce market-based rates of remuneration on required reserves. These measures, together with the issuance of MMA certificates, would tend to impose a new quasi-fiscal burden on the MMA, which would have to be passed through to the budget to ensure the transparency of fiscal policy. One way of achieving this would be by raising the interest rate on the M&IA’s ways and means advances to the Government from the current rate of 4 percent per annum to a market-based rate in line with the yield on MMA certificates. The authorities accepted these proposals in principle. However, because of concerns about possible adverse effects on the budget and on the stability of the financial system, they were more inclined toward a policy of incremental increases in the interest rate ceiling for rufiyaa loans. Over the medium term, a shift to a market-oriented system of indirect monetary manapement will be required to promote the efficient allocation of savings and investment. Following a progressive replacement of the stock of MMA credit to the Government with treasury bills, the h4MA should be able to control the growth of money and credit through open-market-type operations. This would make it possible to phase out credit ceilings, reduce the required reserve ratio toward the norms prevailing in internationally competitive markets, and conduct monetary policy through the management of reserve money. The authorities emphasized that they would be prepared to proceed with such deregulation only after an adequate system of bank supervision can ensure that the banking system remains sound. Technical assistance in this area is to be provided by the AsDB. 3Since 1987, all bank loans in excess of Rf250,OOO or $25,000 have been subject to the prior approval of the MMA.

Exchange rate developments and policies The exchange rate of the rufivaa has been kept unchanged vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar since October 1994, at a midpoint rate of Rf 11.77 per U.S. dollar and a spread of 10 laari (i.e., Rf 0.10) between the buying and selling rates. Commercial banks and foreign exchange dealers continue to be required to operate within that spread. As regards the policy of exchange market intervention, there has been no change since January 1994. The GEC has been kept open and, despite the improved external environment, demand for foreign exchange through the GEC has not abated. To protect the MMA’s reserve position, the daily limits on the purchases of foreign exchange by businesses or households ($2,000 per customer for checks and $300 for cash) have remained in effect, In addition, beginning in early 1995, MIFCO was required to surrender to the MMA, at the official buying rate, a portion of its foreign exchange earnings that it previously sold to the State Trading Organization (STO) at the midpoint rate. The staff team pointed out that the rate at which the rufiyaa had been recently fixed was not a market-clearing level. This was evident by the fact that authorized nonbank dealers were willing only to buy foreign exchange at the officially allowed rates and would not sell. Given a spread of less than 1 percentage point between the official buying and selling rates, commercial banks also had little incentive to become active traders of foreign exchange and did not meet all demands from their customers. Thus, the existing exchange rate arrangement, combined with the daily limits on sales through the GEC, continued to cause a nonavailability of foreign exchange on a timely basis for payments for current international transactions, thereby giving rise to an exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2 (a). Noting also that the recently imposed surrender requirement effectively resulted in a new distortionary tax on MIFCO, the staff emphasized the risks that would be posed by a continuation of the existing exchange rate policy. In the absence of rapid disinflation, a continuing appreciation of the real effective exchange rate would further undermine the profitability of the fish export industry and could, ultimately, make the external position untenable. The staff team made a case for a market-oriented exchange rate mechanism along the lines suggested by a recent MAE mission.4 While accepting the need to let the exchange rate better reflect market forces, the authorities expressed concerns about the possible inflationary ‘Under such a system, the MMA could (i) allow commercial banks and other authorized dealers to quote their own rates within a wider band; (ii) use the midpoint of the weighted average of buying and selling rates of commercial banks as the next day’s official rate; (iii) abolish su i-render requirements and suspend foreign exchange sales to trading firms and individuals through the GEC, at least for noncash transactions; and (iv) intervene to smooth exchange rate fluctuations only under exceptional circumstances, and always at market rates Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- lo- effects of a devaluation. The staff agreed that, initially, the introduction of a market-oriented exchange rate policy would likely result in a substantial depreciation of the rufiyaa. However, the inflationary impact would be significantly mitigated by the implementation of a package of measures to tighten fiscal and monetary policies as discussed above. With a large share of government revenues denominated in foreign exchange, and a relatively small external debt service burden, adherence to the nominal expenditure targets consistent with eliminating the domestic financing of the budget deficit should give rise to a repayment of government debt to the MMA, which would be greater the larger the depreciation. Likewise, ceilings on the flow of credit to the private sector would become more restrictive with a depreciated exchange rate, while interest rate liberalization would allow deposit and loan rates to rise in line with inflationary expectations. 2. Trade policies The staff team noted that, while the private sector has been allowed to participate in some fisheries operations in recent years, exports of fresh and frozen tuna can only be channeled through the government-owned MIFCO. The recent decline in international tuna prices, together with the new surrender requirement, is likely to hamper MIFCO’s ability to compete with private sector exporters. Over the medium term, as the Coastal Fisheries Project and the IDA-supported Third Fisheries Project are completed, MIFCO’s debt-service obligations to the Government (on subsidiary loans) are expected to rise sharply and large increases in h4IFCO’s capacity utilization will be required to enable it to remain profitable. The staff team argued that a liberalization of tuna exports, together with the partial privatization of MIFCO, would be essential to encourage the private sector to invest in new collector vessels and help make full use of the expanding industrial capacity. However, the authorities are concerned that such measures might further weaken MIFCO’s ability to compete for the needed raw material inputs and might undermine the company’s viability. 1mnor-t trade has been relatively free of restrictions since most quotas were removed in 1989 and an import licensing system, which remains in place, is administered liberally. However, the ST0 continues to be the principal channel for public sector imports as well as imports of the three staple foods (rice, wheat flour, and sugar), whose prices are also subject to regulation. The authorities explained that the public procurement rules were introduced to prevent overpricing by private sector suppliers, while the regulations on staple food imports were aimed at ensuring the maintenance of orderly market conditions. Quotas on private imports of the three staples had been nonbinding in recent years, and the ST0 generally broke even on these operations. However, following last year’s increases in international sugar prices, the STO’s price was not fully adjusted, giving rise to losses that are being covered through the budget. D. Public Enterprise and Regulatory Reforms Public enterprises dominate key sectors of the economy, and the weak profitability of many enterprises, together with waning donor support for new infrastructural projects, is Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - likely to constrain investment growth in the period ahead. Privatization is not on the authorities’ immediate agenda, owing, in part, to concerns that it might lead to the emergence of monopolies, which would be difficult to regulate and tax in the absence of adequate accounting and regulatory systems. However, the authorities recognize that the enterprises’ lagging performance is a burden on the budget and a hindrance to overall economic growth. In recent years, steps have been taken to improve the managerial autonomy and consolidate the operations of several enterprises, and the Public Enterprise Unit was recently founded in the MOFT to improve the monitoring of existing accounts. A more proper accounting system is to be established with technical assistance under the World Bank’s Institutional Development Fund, which is also to help prepare a more comprehensive program of enterprise reform. In the meantime, to strengthe,n the finances of key enterprises, the authorities are considering the introduction of major increases in tariffs that have, in recent years, been kept artificially low. These include electricity tariffs in the atolls, port dues and container charges in the Male harbor, and inter-island airfares. The authorities also plan to introduce market- based rents on government-owned properties that have been occupied rent-free by public enterprises. Improvements in the legal and regulators system are necessary to encourage private investment. In the tourism sector, recent steps to liberalize subleasing restrictions have improved the marketability of existing resorts, enhanced their use as collateral for bank loans, and encouraged inflows of direct foreign investment. To expand the availability of long-term financing, there is also a need to improve mortgage legislation, strengthen enforcement procedures for the settlement ,of debts, and allow the issuance of securities by private firms. The staff team was informed that some of these issues are to be addressed by a new company law, which is now under preparation. E. Medium-Term Outlook The staff prepared a medium-term scenario that illustrates how the key macroeconomic obiectives might be attained with the help of the above-proposed policies. Under this scenario, real GDP would rise at a rate of about 6 percent per annum, inflation would be brought near the levels prevailing in major trading partners, the overall balance of payments would remain in surplus, and the level of reserves would increase sufficiently to allow repayment of the balance of payments loan due in 1998 and maintain coverage at about two months’ imports (Tables 5 and 6). In the fiscal area, a new tax package would help raise domestic revenue by 2 % percentage points of GDP between 1995 and 1999, while a freeze on government employment, together with continued restraint in other outlays on goods and services, would help lower current expenditure by another 2 ‘/2 percentage points of GDP. Domestically financed capital expenditure would rise by 2 34 percentage points of GDP over the same period, helping to moderate the impact of a decline in foreign aid inflows. The domestic financing of the budget deficit would shift to an annual repayment of government debt to the MRMA equivalent to 1 X-2 ‘/z percent of GDP in 1996-99, and the public debt ratio would Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- decline rapidly, falling to 58 ‘/z percent of GDP by 1999 or about the same level as in 1989. The rate of growth of broad money would decline to 11 percent in 1995 and would not exceed 10 percent per annum in 1996-99. Given the fiscal position, this would allow for a steady accumulation of official reserves while leaving ample room for the growth of credit to the private sector. In the external sector, the scenario envisages the adoption of a market-oriented exchange rate policy, together with structural reforms to encourage private capital inflows and sustain an adequate rate of growth of current receipts. Domestic exports would decline in 1995, but would recover strongly in 1996-99, reflecting a liberalization of export policies and the partial privatization of MIFCO, which would encourage private investment in the fisheries sector. Tourism receipts would also increase rapidly, as regulatory reforms would support sustained investment in resort development. Annual aid inflows would progressively decline to about $35 million by 1998-99 or about the average inflow recorded over the 1991-95 period. However, this decline would be partly offset by a recovery of private nondebt capital inflows, reflecting the opening of new islands for resort development following the completion of resorts in the Ari atoll. Notwithstanding the broadly favorable outlook under this scenario, the staff emphasized the risks stemming from the continuing vulnerabilitv of the external position. With the level of reserves remaining equivalent to 2-2 l/z months of imports, there would be limited protection from external shocks or policy slippages. Thus, if foreign exchange receipts were to be significantly weaker than envisaged in the scenario, there would likely be downward pressure on the exchange rate, a reduced ability to meet the economy’s import requirements, and lower economic growth. To minimize the downside risks, and foster competitive export industries, the staff underscored the need to reinforce macroeconomic stabilization by instituting a liberal exchange and trade system. F. Other Issues The preservation of the environment is critical to the long-term sustainability of economic development in Maldives, owing to the particular fragility of the eco-system. Population pressures remain a fundamental problem, especially in Male. The authorities have recently intensified efforts to contain the rate of growth of the population and strengthen the enforcement of national environmental laws. To ensure that all tourist resorts are equipped as mandated by law, subsidized financing was secured from a donor government for the purchase of incinerators, which are to be installed in all resorts by the end of 1995. Similar plans are being developed for the installation of waste-water management systems and donor support is also being used for the construction of coastal defense systems. In the statistical area, the most serious challenges are in the real sector. With the help of Fund technical assistance, substantial improvements were made in recent years in balance of payments, customs, and money and banking statistics. However, national accounts data are lacking and the production of a consumer price index (CPI) was discontinued in 1994 because Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - of outdated weights, data inconsistencies, and compilation difficulties. As a result, staff estimates for nominal GDP, and for recent inflation, are based on unofficial data. Following a request by the authorities, an STA expert visited Male in May 1995, to help construct a new CPI series based on an income and expenditure survey conducted in 1993. The AsDB is expected to provide assistance on national accounts in early 1996. IV. Staff Appraisal The macroeconomic imbalances that emerged in the early 1990s began to be redressed in 1994. With the help of sharp cuts in domestically financed expenditure, the budget deficit was curbed, government borrowing from the MMA was contained, and the growth of money and credit decelerated. As the external environment also improved, the overall balance of payments shifted into a surplus, and the decline in official reserves, which had proceeded at an unsustainable rate in 1993, was arrested. These developments are clearly welcome, but they should not detract from the challenges that lie ahead. Inflation is still too high and there is a risk that fiscal policy slippages and a reacceleration of credit growth will aggravate demand pressures. The overall balance of payments is likely to remain in surplus in the short run, owing, in part, to the continuing buoyancy of tourism activity and an expected surge of foreign aid inflows. But the underlying external position remains vulnerable, economic efficiency continues to be hampered by pervasive government intervention, and the prospects for sustained economic growth are uncertain. To build on the recent achievements, there is a need for an outward-oriented program of stabilization and structural reform aimed at promoting private sector-led growth within a stable macroeconomic environment. Fiscal consolidation will have to remain a central element of the adjustment strategy. The staff welcomes the austerity policies envisaged in the 1995 budget and the ongoing efforts to substitute foreign assistance and private investment for domestically financed expenditure. However, the anti-inflationary thrust of these policies needs to be reinforced by bolder steps to freeze public employment, tighten budget implementation procedures, and lower spending appropriations, so as to eliminate the domestic financing of the deficit in 1995. Over the medium term, to promote external stability while protecting essential public investment, government savings will have to increase markedly. The staff endorses the Government’s plans to supplement expenditure restraint with measures to broaden the tax base and supports the request for technical assistance in this area. A tightening of monetary policy will also be necessary to ensure inflation control and external balance. The planned replacement of existing credit controls with bank-specific credit ceilings should help slow the growth of monetary and credit aggregates consistent with the need to reduce inflation to single digits in 1995. ‘To be fully effective, these actions must be supported by improved incentives for saving and financial intermediation. Plans to absorb banks’ excess reserves should be implemented without delay, interest rates should be liberalized, and required reserves remunerated at market-related rates. The development of an Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- adequate system of bank supervision, together with a shift to a system of indirect monetary management, should make it possible to remove direct credit controls, lower reserve requirements, and improve financial sector efficiency over the medium term. To foster the economy’s development along the lines of its comparative advantages, the exchange system will have to be rationalized. The recent exchange rate policy has penalized a large segment of the export industry and, together with the daily limits on the availability of foreign exchange through the GEC, gives rise to an exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2 (a). Until the authorities propose a precise time table for the removal of that restriction, the staff does not recommend its approval. The authorities are encouraged to liberalize the exchange system as soon as possible by adopting a market- oriented exchange rate policy. A liberal trade system will also be essential to promote competition and efficiency. To ensure that fisheries remains a competitive and expanding industry, the private sector will need to play an active role in investing in new collector vessels and helping to enhance the industry’s capacity utilization. To this end, tuna fish exports should be liberalized and a portion of MIFCO’s growing capacity privatized. Import quotas and price controls for the three staple foods should also be removed and public sector procurement rules eliminated. The ST0 should be relieved of obligations to maintain stocks of the staple foods, although it could remain prepared to increase its imports, and domestic sales, in the event of undue disruption in private sector supplies. To underscore the authorities’ commitment to a free trade policy, the import licensing requirement should be abolished. With foreign aid inflows expected to cover a progressively smaller share of the economy’s investment requirements, growth prospects will need to be enhanced by measures to streamline public enterprise operations, reduce government involvement in productive activities, and encourage private investment. Recent steps to improve the monitoring of enterprise accounts are welcome, and the authorities are encouraged to expedite efforts to institute improved accounting systems and prepare a program of enterprise reform and privatization. The recent proposals to adjust tariffs in key enterprises and eliminate implicit subsidies from the budget should be promptly implemented. Equally important for the development of a dynamic private sector will be the early passage of the new company law, together with a rationalization of other laws and regulations. Maldives has substantially improved the coverage and quality of its statistical base over the last few years, notwithstanding a continuing shortage of adequately trained staff. The authorities are encouraged to continue to make good use of the technical assistance being provided by the Fund and put in place a system for the collection and compilation of timely and reliable data on price developments. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Maldives be conducted on the standard 12-month cycle.

Beginning in July 1985, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was linked to a trade-weighted basket of currencies, but the exchange rate vis-Lvis the U.S. dollar remained relatively stable until February 1987. On March 1, 1987, the rufiyaa was devalued by 29 percent vis-Lvis the U.S. dollar. Since then, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa has been allowed to move broadly in line with market forces, albeit with varying degrees of periodic official intervention. At present, the exchange arrangement is classified as a managed floating system. As of end-April 1995, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was Rf 11.77 per U.S. dollar, VIII.

The first two of these projects have been fully disbursed and were completed in March 1983 and June 199 1, respectively. A Third Fisheries Project (Cr. 2327~MAL) was approved in January 1992. This project is designed to increase foreign earnings and the incomes of fishermen from tuna exports and builds on the existing system of artisanal fisheries and small-scale fish collection in the southern atolls. Port and fish storage facilities are to be improved and collection vessels provided to strengthen the atoll-wide fish collection system. Technical assistance is also to be provided for institution development and for improving data collection and environmental monitoring during project implementation. An airport upgrading project for Male (Cr. 2143- MAL), approved in July 1990, has provided for the rehabilitation and upgrading of airport facilities as well as technical assistance and training for institution building; the project was closed in December 1994. An education and training project (Cr. 1981 -MAL), approved in March 1989, is aimed at supporting the Government’s efforts to meet the economy’s demand for indigenous skilled workers and technical and managerial personnel. Building on this experience and the Government’s interest in further assistance from IDA for the education sector, a second education and training project (Cr. 2701-MAL) was approved in April 1995. This project will focus on improving the quality and access to education through the strengthening of primary teacher training programs, introducing an in-country junior secondary teacher training program, and increasing secondary school access in the atolls. *Prepared by World Bank staff.

Recent Developments Maldives has substantially improved its financial and economic statistics in recent years, with the help of several technical assistance missions from STA. During 1994, a mission on balance of payments statistics helped design a system for the estimation of private capital flows based on information available from commercial banks. However, the compilation of more reliable statistics collected directly from tourist resorts and hotels will probably have to await enactment of statistical legislation. In May 1995, an STA expert visited Male to help construct a new consumer price index (CPI) following the discontinuation of the old index. B. Outstanding Statistical Issues 1. Real sector CPI data that were reported through September 1994 were retracted in November 1994 because of inaccuracies and inconsistencies deriving from data collection and compilation. An STA expert visited Maldives in May 1995 to assist in constructing a new CPI series, based on an income and expenditure survey conducted in 1993, and developing a methodology for collecting and scrutinizing data. In the national accounts, official data on the expenditure components of GDP, implicit deflators, and GDP at current market prices are not available for recent years. The ministry of Planning, Human Resources, and Environment has requested technical assistance from the AsDB to establish a system of national accounts based on the revised 1993 SNA. 2. Government finance The latest government finance statistics (GFS) data published in the GFS Yearbook (GFSY) pertain to 1991, although GFS data for 1992 were reported in late 1994 and published in IIFS. The authorities plan to update GFS data through 1994 for IFS and resume reporting data for the GFSY before year-end, after reviewing the derivation tables in line with the recommendations of a 1991 STA multitopic mission. The monitoring of the financial accounts of public enterprises is expected to be strengthened following the recent establishment of the Public Enterprise Unit in the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Technical assistance to set up improved accounting and monitoring systems is to be provided through the World Bank’s Institutional Development Fund.

Monetary accounts Consistent and accurate monetary data are reported and compiled on a regular basis. As recommended by the STA mission of June 1993, commercial banks now report assets and liabilities on a gross basis consistent with the new reporting instructions and several accounts in the MMA balance sheet and analytical accounts have been appropriately reclassified. 4. Balance of payments Following the STA mission of February 1994, a number of measures were taken to improve data coverage and quality. Private sector capital flows are now shown separately from errors and omissions, with estimates derived from data collected from commercial banks on the basis of a form designed by the STA mission. Estimates of freight and transportation are now satisfactory and data on imports stratified by mode of transportation are being collected. Data on workers’ remittances obtained from commercial banks are believed to be accurate, although a stratified sample survey on expatriate workers has not yet been undertaken. Problems remain with respect to the coverage and timing adjustments required for imports of ships, aircrafts, and helicopters. As the recommended resorts/hotels joint survey received an unsatisfactory response, travel receipts are still estimated on the basis of a small-sample inquiry made in February 1994 to determine daily average expenditure by tourists. Estimates of profit remittances and reinvested earnings in the tourism sector are still unsatisfactory. Data on official transfers continue to be based on the budget. However, the estimates of official transfers compiled by the Department of External Resources (DER) within the Ministry of Finance and Treasury differ significantly from the budgetary data. In collaboration with the UNDP, DER is seeking to identity the possible sources of discrepancy.
