Introduction’ The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Wellington on August 19-30, 1995.’ Meetings were held with the Minister ofFinance, Mr. Bill Birch; the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Dr. Don Brash; the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. Murray Horn; and other senior officials from the Treasury, the Reserve Bank, and other government agencies, In addition, the staff team held discussions with representatives of trade unions, business organizations, and research and financial institutions. At the last Article IV consultation with New Zealand on July 25, 1994, Executive Directors expressed strong support for the authorities’ basic policy strategy, including their plan to run budget surpluses in order to reduce public debt. While inflation had remained low, Directors noted that the effectiveness of New Zealand’s new monetary policy framework would still need to be demonstrated over the course of a full cycle. Directors considered that the extensive structural reforms of the past decade had increased the productive potential of the economy. They urged the authorities to complete the process of trade liberalization, and questioned the role of the agricultural marketing boards. The New Zealand authorities compile and publish a wide array of economic and financial statistics. The core data that form the basis of the Fund’s surveillance are available on a timely basis. However, policymaking could benefit from an improvement in the quality of the national accounts statistics (see Annex III). The next parliamentary elections, which are due in the fall of 1996, will be New Zealand’s first held under the so-called “mixed member proportional” (MMP) electoral system, which replaces a “first-past-the-post” system.j Consequently, future governments are likely to be coalition, rather than single-party, governments. In the transition, existing political parties are jockeying for position and many new parties are being created, adding uncertainty to the economic and political outlook. ‘The term “country,” as used in this report, does not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice; the term also covers some territorial entities that are not states, but for which statistical data are maintained and provided internationally on a separate and independent basis. *The staff team consisted of Mr. Kronenberg (Head), Messrs. Ostry and Op de Beke, Ms. Tan (all SEA), and Mrs. Ruth (Administrative Assistant, SEA). Ms. Kelly (SEA) participated in the concluding meetings. Mr. Petrie, Advisor to the Executive Director for New Zealand, also attended the discussions. ‘Under the MMP, roughly half the seats will still be decided in district elections, with the allocation of the remaining seats determined to ensure that a party’s total representation is proportional to its share of the vote in the nationwide party list election.

Economic Setting Followingfnr-renching shuclural reforms in Lhe second halfofthe 198Os, the economic expansion that began in 1991 has proven to be durable Growth averaged nearly 6percent in 1993/94-1994/95’ and has been broadly based, both across production sectors and expenditure components. The unemployment rate has declined sharply, and inJlation has remained low by historical and international standards, although the Reserve Bank’s target range of O-2 percent for underlying inflation was breached by a small margin in June 1995. Thefiscalposition has strengthened markedly thanks to the buoyani economy and the structural measures taken to improve expenditure control. Despite good export performance, the external cuwent account deficit has widened, reflecting rapid import growth, particularly of capital goods, and large profit and dividend remittances. Private capital inflows, mainly in the form of direct foreign investments, but also signiJicantportfolio inflows, have fully financed the cuwent account deficit. New Zealand’s current economic expansion should be viewed against the background of a series of far-reaching structural reforms carried out since 1985 (Box I). The reforms addressed three major areas. Institutional reforms imparted a strong medium-term orientation to monetary and fiscal policies so as to create a stable macroeconomic environment; other reforms, notably trade liberalization, privatization, and labor market deregulation, aimed at enhancing competition and efficiency; and, finally, much effort was put into raising the productivity of the core government sector. The reforms originated from the recognition in the mid-1980s that the excessively interventionist policies of the past had been an inadequate response to the long-term decline in the terms of trade and that, as a result, New Zealand had found itself in an economic crisis. The positive supply effects of the reforms took time--a number of years--to materialize, but they are clearly discernible in the buoyancy of the current economic upswing. Against the background of a large amount of slack, economic growth began to respond to the improved policy environment in 1991, turning positive in annual average terms in 1992/93 and rising sharply to nearly 6 percent in 1993/94- 1994/95 (Table 1 and Charts 1 and 2). Unlike previous periods of rapid growth, which typically had been led by a fiscal expansion or a positive terms-of-trade shock, the initial impetus for the recovery came from a surge in export volumes and growth quickly became broadly based, as producers moved to augment capacity to meet rising demand. Growth in investment in plant and equipment increased sharply to 32 percent in 1993/94-1994195. Nevertheless, capacity utilization in manufacturing continued to rise, reaching an historically high rate of over 90 percent at the ‘National accounts, balance of payments, and financial statistics are compiled for the financial year ending March 3 1. Budgetary data are compiled for the fiscal year ending June 30. The discrepancy between the expenditure and production measures of GDP tends to be large and variable. Because the production measure is more stable, it is generally found to be the better indicator for tracking overall growth and is used as such in this report Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-S- Box 1. New Zealand: A Decade al Struchlrl Reforms Following mounting frustration over a long-term deterioration in NW Zealand’s rclativc growth performance, the Labor Party, after its clcctoral landslide in 1984,launchcd a program of radical structural reforms that was subsequently continued under National Party govcmmcots from 1990 onward. Triggcrcd by an exchange crisis, the program started with a ssrics of tinmvzinl reforms AtIer a 20 pcrccnt devaluation in 1984, the exchange rate was floated in 1985, accompanied by the libxaliition of the capital account and the deregulation of the foreign exchange market. Monetary control became msrket&sed after the abolition of rcservc requircmcnts, interest rate controls, and credit guidclincs. Most recently, a new system for bank supervision was introduced that cmphasizcs market discipline. Following more than a decade of double-digit inflation, the Reserve Bank Act of 1989 made price stability the sole objective of monetary policy. It gave the Rcservc Bank full instrument independence in achieving price stability, which is defined in an agrccmcnt with the Govcmmcnt BS year-tc-year underlying inflation bctwccn 0 and 2 pxccnt. Public sector reforms came in two waves. At first, priority was placed on eliminating the govcmmcnt provision of markctablc goods and services. This was achieved by corporatizing and eventually privatizing a great many govcmmcnt operations. The second wave started in 1988, with B financial managcmcnt reform to raise the cfftcicncy of the core government. Department heads wcrc subjected to pcrformancc contracts for the provision ofwelldctincd outputs. In return, to be able to deliver, they received much greater discretion in the mansgcmcnt of their budgets and labor inputs. This was followed by a gradual change in disclosure and accounting practices, which wcrc cvcntually ccditicd in the Fiinl Responsibility Act of 1994. That act prescribes maximum transparency about fiscal strategies, outcomes and forecasts (which includes accrual accounting for the whole of the government) in support of responsible fiscal management. Since 1985 also, the tax system was compktcly overhauled in order to broaden the base, lower marginal rates, gcncratc more re~cnucs, and shitl the incidence from income to consumption. The number of brackets of the personal income tax was reduced from tivc to twc-with the top rate of 33 pcrccnt equal to the company tax rate-and most exemptions were abolished A flat-rate value-added tax on all goods and scrviccs of 12% pcrccnt replaced a range of indirect taxes. The wclfarc system was strcamlincd in 1991 when for many programs, including supcrannuatian, benefits were reduced, and better targeting introduced Arguably, the most influential of all reforms has been trade libernllzation. Started in the 197Os, the pace of libcralization was stcppcd up significantly aflcr 1984. A&r a long history ofextreme protectionism, New Zealand now has protection lcvcls comparable to the svcragc among industrial countries, and is well on its way to becoming one of the most open economies. Finally, the last ofthe major reforms changed indushisl mlstions with the passage ofthc Employment Contracts Act of 1991. Replacing a rigid and complex system of industry-wide occupational awards, it introduced the legal framework for a highly deccntrrdizcd wage-bargaining system. Under the new system, multi-enterprise bargaining collapsed in favor of enterprise bargaining and in many sectors, individual contracts became the norm. It has greatly enhanced the tlcxibility in working hours and patterns and nmuncration practices. and stemmed the spillover of wage pressures across enterprises and sectors. beginning of 1995. Residential construction experienced a pronounced cycle, particularly in the Auckland area, which peaked in the second half of 1994, reflecting the unwinding of pent- up demand, the decline, and then rise, in mortgage interest rates, and increased immigration. Private consumption accelerated in 1993194 and again in 1994/9S, underpinned by the strong (actual and expected) growth in real household disposable income associated with the improvement in employment opportunities. .,-.. .- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- Tata. 1. wow z..hncl: a..1 s.ctor I”dio.tor*. 1990,91-1994195 1Annu.l .“.r.g. prcmt chul*.. m1.aa otimnri.. in*ic.t.d) _____________ y.ar. .“di”g Marsh------------ 199w91 1991,92 1992,93 1993,94 1994195 -2.4 -0.1 2.3 -8.1 IO.9 -1.9 1.7 7.6 1.9 -0.9 -0.6 5.5 5.5 4.5 9.9 5.1 -5.9 -1.1 0.3 -12.2 -24.5 -1.4 3.7 6.6 -3.4 -2.5 -1.3 1.7 2.5 1.9 -1.5 11.1 2.9 4.4 0.2 0.5 II.9 -4.0 2.4 -3.1 1.1 8.6 1.6 2.9 1.1 2.0 1.6 1.0 10.2 1.9 0.7 -0.4 6.8 3.0 -2.6 25.3 -6.0 1.1 -1.8 8.9 12.0 5.4 5.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 3.9 9.5 0.8 2.6 -1.5 8.7 6.0 -0.6 23.1 20.4 -0.5 -5.6 7.1 18.1 3.7 6.0 2.4 2.1 1.4 5.0 6.9 2.8 1.7 -0.9 2.9 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public16- Il. 6 1 4 I - 7 - CHART I NEW ZEALAND INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS, 1986~94 " GROWTH OF REAL GOP (Annual percentage change) \ Asia 2,' CONSUMER PRICE INFLATION (Annual percentage change) A Ncur Zcdond \ \ Asin 2,' __ ~..,--. 1 GROSS FIXED CAPITAL FORMATION 34 4 1 FISCAL BALANCE 4 32.

The rate of long-term unemployment has declined even more rapidly. Some skills shortages have now emerged, and, according to Treasury estimates, growth in unit labor costs (based on hours worked) changed from negative I .6 percent during 1993194 to 2.9 percent during 1994195. Since 1989, the Reserve Bank has conducted monetary policy with considerable autonomy to achieve an explicit inflation target. The present Policy Targets Agreement (PTA) between the Minister of Finance and the Reserve Bank Governor calls for the CPI, or “headline” inflation, to be maintained within a range of O-2 percent. However, the PTA also specifies a number of circumstances under which deviations from the target range are permissible. The “caveats” include significant terms-of-trade shocks, the direct impact of interest charges on the CPI (mainly through mortgage interest rates), and significant changes in indirect taxes or subsidies. In 1994, the Reserve Bank announced that it was switching the presentation of its target from headline inflation to a measure of “underlying” inflation, which effectively removes from the CPI the impact of the caveats. With inflation projected to pick up in the period I2 to I8 months ahead, the Reserve Bank encouraged an increase in short-term interest rates from 4% percent at the beginning of 1994 to 9% percent at year’s end (Charts 3 and 4). Long-term rates rose less steeply, so that the yield curve became slightly inverted. Despite this tightening of monetary conditions, underlying inflation accelerated to 2.2 percent in the year to June 1995, the first breach of the target range since it was established in 1992. New Zealand’s fiscal position improved remarkably during the first half of the 1990s reflecting both the cyclical strength of the economy and measures taken to improve the structural balance (Table 2 and Chart 5). The budget shifted from deficits in the range of l-4 percent of GDP in the early 1990s to a small surplus in 1993/94. The surplus widened to 3 percent of GDP in 1994/95, bringing net public sector debt down from a peak of 5 1 percent of GDP at end-1991/92 to an estimated 38 percent ofGDP at end-1994/95. Standard and Poor’s reacted by upgrading its sovereign debt rating for New Zealand in December 1994 from AA- to AA; however, this still left it among the lowest in the OECD, and two grades below the AAA rating New Zealand held prior to 1983. Measures to strengthen the structural budget position focused on containing government spending. The productivity of the public sector was substantially enhanced by reforms that gave department managers greater autonomy in managing their financial and human resource inputs, while holding them accountable for the delivery of well-defined outputs. The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994 built on these reforms, emphasizing transparency and accountability for the Government as a whole (Box 2). Social welfare programs were also reformed. In 1991 and 1992, ehgrbdny requirements were tightened, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- Tsbh 2.

New Zealand: Fiscal Responsibility Act In an encmp~ to improve the conduct of fiscal policy by Legislating principles for rcsponsiblc fiscal managernerd, New Zealand adoplcd in 1994 the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA). The Act is the culmination ofthc comprchcnsivc public sector reforms begun in 19118. Inspired by the success of the Reserve Bank Act I989 in instilling moncfa~ policy discipline. it rcprcscnts an innovative approach to entrenching prudent fiscal policy. Given the disappointing international cxpericncc in this regard, the PTU docs not prescribe quantified fiscal targets but sets out a number of principles for responsible fiscal managcmcnt. These arc: . to reduce the total Crown’ debt to “prudent levels” by running tiscal surpluses; . once achicvcd, to maintain prudent debt lcvcls “by ensuring that, on avcragc, over a rcasonablc period oftimc. the total operating expenses of the Crown do not exceed its total operating rcvcnues”; . to achieve and maintain sut%cicnt levels of Crown net worth to provide a buffer against future adverse devclopmcnts;’ . to manage prudently the fiscal risks facing the Crown (e.g., its pension liabilities), and . to pursue politics that lead to predictable tax rates. The Act allows Ihe Government to temporarily depart from these ptinciples provided it explains its reasons, plus how and within what time frame it plans to rctum to them. The FRA stresses govcmmcntal accountability to Parliament and the electorate for observing these principles by improving the quality and frequency of tiscal information. The quality ofthe Crown‘s financial reporting improved because the FRA requires that it be prepared on a basis consisfenl wth generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP), including ,wcruaI accounting. This is expected to bcncr measure the economic xnpact of the tiscal position than the previous cash-based accounting framework. Furthermore, the bests for financial reporting is now set indcpcndcntly ofthc Government, which, it is hoped, will enhance the credibility of fiscal reporting. The frequency of financial reporting has increased under lhc FRA The total set now includes an annual rcpori from the Minister of Finance to Parliament on the Govemmcnt‘s tiscal strategy (discussing the likely dcvclopmcnt of crucial variables 10 years into the iuture). twice-yearly economic and tiscal updates and regular monthly financial statements for the financial year to dale. An economic and fiscal update must also be published prior to each general election. In addition to providing d&led revenue and expenditure projections thra years out, thcsc updates assess the main risks to the outlook and contain a full set of lhc Crown’s balance sheet plus accompanying notes. The result is that any changes in the Govcmment’s financial position arc rapidly sign&d to financial markets and the public, ‘The Crown covers core govemmcnt, the Reserve Bank, and the Gavcmmmt’s equity share in state-owned enrcrprises and Crown entities. ‘The Crown‘s net worth end-lunc 1995 stood at negative SNZ 3 billion the level of benefits lowered for a broad range of programs, including unemployment benefits, family assistance, student loans, and public housing. The national pension was made partly income dependent, and its ehgrbrhty age was set to increase gradually from 60 to 65 years over a IO-year period ending in 2001. Throughout the first half of the 1990s New Zealand’s external position has been characterized by moderate current account deficits comprising surpluses on the merchandise trade account offset by deficits on the invisibles account (Table 3 and Chart 6).

Despite an appreciating exchange rate, exports continued to perform well, with the volume of noncommodity manufactured exports rising by 18 percent. Net private capital inflows have exceeded the current account deficit in most recent years, enabling the offtcial sector (Government plus Reserve Bank) to reduce its net external debt. Positive interest differentials, low inflation, and an appreciating exchange rate appear to motivate the portfolio investments, whereas the direct investment is associated with the boosted confidence in the New Zealand economy following the structural reforms. The New Zealand dollar floats freely without any exchange market intervention from the Reserve Bank.’ Following a decline in 1992/93, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by nearly 20 percent during 1993/94-1994/95, reflecting the enhanced attractiveness of New Zealand to capital inflows (Chart 7). The reduction in government debt, together with valuation gains and economic growth, resulted in a reduction in New Zealand’s gross external debt from 90 percent of GDP at end-March 1994 to 78 percent of GDP at end-March 1995 (with government external debt declining from 41 percent of GDP to 29 percent of GDP). Nonetheless, this gross external debt ratio remains among the highest in the OECD and the newly industrialized economies. New Zealand’s total net external liabilities (both debt and equity) are estimated to be equivalent to 81 percent of GDP. III. Report on the Discussions The discussions focused on the appropriate policy settings to support continued noninjlationary growth. Although the extensive structural andfinancial reforms of the past decade were clearly paying dividends in terms of an improved growth potential, it was also evident that the rates of growth experienced over thepast two years were not sustainable. Financialpolicies would, therefore, need to remain tight in the near term to bring inflation back within the target range and to prevent a further deterioration in the external position. Growth prospects have been enhanced by the continued momentum of trade liberalization, bat progress in reforming the agricultural producer boards has been slow. A. Growth Potential and Economic Outlook Much of the discussions concerned the long-run sustainable growth rate and its implications for the near-term stance of financial policies. The authorities were also interested in whether growth rates on the order of those attained by the fast-growing Asian economies were within New Zealand’s reach. The mission considered that the sustained implementation ‘As the Reserve Bank does not intervene in the foreign exchange market, reserve changes tend to be small and principally reflect changes in the Treasury’s holdings of international reserves, associated with its debt management.

These developments, in turn, were promoted by the far- reaching deregulation of the economy and the maintenance of transparent, predictable and stable macroeconomic policies. Given the large range for the potential growth estimates, it was difficult to say whether the output gap was currently positive or negative, but the gap was clearly small. Consequently, the very rapid rate of growth recorded over the past two years could not be sustained for much longer. The authorities broadly concurred with the mission’s assessment of potential growth. Based on its own projections for labor force and productivity growth, the Treasury estimated potential growth at 3%4 percent, whereas the Reserve Bank’s estimate was toward the bottom of this range. The Treasury thought output was still slightly below potential, but the Reserve Bank thought it was above, in part, this reflected their views on the NAIRU, with the Treasury estimating it at around 5 percent and the Reserve Bank in the range of 6-7 percent. The authorities pointed to several indicators that suggested that the desired slowdown of the economy was already under way, including retail sales, business confidence, and residential construction permits.’ It appeared that the early monetary tightening had steered the economy to a soft landing. Projections prepared by the Treasury in August anticipated that growth would slow to 3.4 percent in 1995/96 and tInther to 3 percent in 1996/97.’ The mission’s medium-term forecasts, not assuming any tax cuts, broadly agreed with those of the authorities (see Annex IV). GDP growth is expected to recover over the course of 1996, following the expected easing of monetary policy, to a rate close to potential by 1997; growth would benefit from robust consumption, boosted by employment gains and wage increases, and a continued strong investment performance; the current account would improve in line with the softening of domestic demand; government operating surpluses would continue to build; wage pressures would keep inflation above the midpoint of the target range. 6For details, see the annex on potential growth in the forthcoming paper on recent economic developments in New Zealand. ’ The June GDP figures, released after the consultation discussions, confirmed that a slowdown was in progress. ‘The Reserve Bank subsequently released economic projections in September that showed much the same growth picture even though they were predicated on tax cuts, assumed by the Bank to be around 1.5 percent of GDP in both years.

Financial Policies Although demand is decelerating andpotentialgrowth appears to have increased, the mission took theposition that there may still be some inflationary pressures in the pipeline Capacity utilization in manufacturing remains at an historically high rate, and the unemployment rate is rapidly approaching the broad range of NAIRU estimates, In these circumstances, financial policies will need to remain tight to ensure that inflationary and evternalpressures do not intensify. Markets are confident of the Reserve Bank’s commitment to bringing inflation back within the target range However, exclusive reliance on monetary policy would require higher interest rates and a higher exchange rate than a more balanced approach, with potentially adverse consequences for investment, competitiveness, and sustainable growth Therefore, restraint should be shared by both fiscal and monetary policies, 1. Fiscal policy The fiscal policy discussions focused on the factors underlying the projected further widening of the budget surplus and the implications of this for tax and expenditure policies. Fiscal policy is being conducted in a medium-term framework designed to reduce the public sector’s vulnerability to shocks. Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act (Box 2) the Government’s main fiscal policy objectives are to reduce net public debt to prudent levels (which the Government has defined as 20-30 percent of GDP), and establish a significantly positive net worth for the public sector (inclusive of physical assets), in the context of a broad-based, low-tax environment. To give this medium-term objective immediate force, the Government has committed itself to continue running budget surpluses in the near term in order to reduce the net public debt to below 30 percent of GDP as rapidly as possible. Toward this end, the 1995/96 budget envisages the surplus will widen to 3.6 percent of GDP, reducing the net public debt to 34 percent of GDP. This assumes that total expenditures will be held constant in nominal terms, with reduced debt servicing creating room for some selective spending increases, notably on welfare, but also on overseas development assistance which is expected to rise modestly, from 0.23 percent of GDP in 1995/96 to 0.25 percent of GDP in 1997/98. Under current policy settings, the Treasury estimates that the surplus would widen to over 7 percent of GDP in 1997/98 and to 10 percent by 2000/01, at which time net public debt would be eliminated. However, the authorities fear that surpluses of this size could give rise to political pressures for increased spending and, thus, might not be sustainable. Given their firm view that the private sector is the main engine for growth, the authorities strongly believe that spending increases should be resisted. Indeed, they are aiming at reducing the ratio of government spending to GDP to below 30 percent over the medium term. Equally, the authorities are concerned about the potential impact of high tax rates on private sector Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-22 - incentives (the tax to GDP ratio for New Zealand is higher than those of Australia, Japan, and the United States, but lower than those of most European countries). Against this background, the authorities are considering a package of tax measures and changes in the structure of some welfare benefits aimed at reducing the effective marginal tax rates for low- and middle-income families. The authorities hope that such measures would enhance the efficiency of the labor market over the longer term, while strengthening social cohesion, but they do not expect the measures to have a major impact on the economy’s supply potential in the near term. To ensure that tax cuts would not endanger the achievement of its main fiscal and macroeconomic objectives, the Government has specified three conditions that must be fulfilled before measures would be implemented: (i) that net public debt would fall below 30 percent of GDP in the year of the tax cuts; (ii) that, on reasonable assumptions, there would be no risk of a return to budget deficits; and (iii) that there would be no significant risk of strong inflationary or balance ofpayments pressures emerging as a result. If fiscal developments remain on course, the authorities anticipate that details of the fiscal package could be announced in late 1995, for implementation in the second half of 1996. The mission considered that the Government’s short- and medium-term fiscal policy objectives were prudent and appropriate. In view of the sizable structural fiscal surplus, which would widen on a current policy basis in the coming years, it agreed that there was likely to be scope for tax cuts while achieving these objectives in the period ahead. In the absence of a major supply side response, the case for tax cuts rested largely on the question of the political sustainability of large and growing fiscal surpluses. With margins of spare capacity nearly eliminated, the mission emphasized that tax cuts could put upward pressure on inflation and the current account deficit. This would require monetary policy to be tighter than otherwise necessary. Given the already high external debt ratio, this would also increase the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks. The mission also pointed to the risks implicit in the assumption that government expenditures could be held constant in nominal terms through 1997/98. Extensive reforms of public sector operations since the early 1990s had generated large productivity improvements, but continued improvements might prove difficult to achieve. At the same time, the demand for certain public goods was likely to rise over the medium term, particularly in the areas of health, education, and transportation infrastructure, reflecting immigration and demographic factors, as well as the recognition that higher sustainable growth requires higher levels of investment in human capital. In view of these considerations, the mission suggested that the budget surplus should not be declining in current circumstances. Moreover, to bring about lasting improvements in the labor supply, it was important that tax cuts be perceived as permanent. Together, these factors suggested a fairly gradual approach to cutting taxes. Implementing the package in phases would seem to be the best way of gauging the economy’s response to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - the cuts and avoiding the possible need for any reversal. Given that the fiscal position was expected to improve on a current policy basis by roughly 2 percent of GDP per annum for the next two years, the mission considered that a prudent fiscal package would aim at reducing the surplus, relative to that baseline, by the order of about l-l% percent, i.e., reducing the net improvement in the surplus to X-1 percent of GDP per year. The authorities stressed that, even after the envisaged tax cuts, the budget would continue to record surpluses on the order of 3 percent of GDP, and the reduction of public sector debt would continue. They were confident that strict expenditure control would be maintained, helped by the FRA framework and by continued productivity gains in the public sector. As regards the interaction between the external and fiscal positions, the authorities pointed out that the level of private external debt was the result of commercially motivated private borrowing and investment decisions. They also noted that a relatively high proportion of New Zealand’s foreign liabilities was in the form of direct foreign investment, which was likely to be less susceptible to sudden reversal than portfolio flows. Therefore, they argued, fiscal policy should be concerned principally with the sustainability of public finances and the prudent management of risks to the public sector’s balance sheet. 2. Monetary policy The discussions on monetary policy covered the recent breach of the inflation target, the prospects for the return of inflation to its target range, and the adequacy of the monetary policy framework.g The mission was also updated on the implementation of the new regime for bank supervision. The Reserve Bank first warned that a breach of its inflation target was imminent in its June 1995 Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), a prediction that was subsequently confirmed by the June quarter CPI. In explaining the reasons for the breach, the Reserve Bank noted that its earlier forecasts had failed to recognize the extent of inflationary pressures building in the construction and housing sectors but acknowledged that more firming of monetary conditions should have taken place in the tirst half of 1994. In a recent report on the episode to the Minister of Finance, the outside members of the Reserve Bank’s Board of Directors concluded that the Governor’s overall performance with respect to the inflation target had been outstanding, and considered that the Bank had acted in a resolute and determined manner that was appropriate, given the information available. As to the implications of the breach for the future conduct of monetary policy, the Reserve Bank staff remained confident that ambitious inflation targeting had enhanced the credibility of policy, and they pointed to the muted reaction of financial markets to the breach as evidence of this confidence. In order to reduce the likelihood of future breaches, the ‘See the forthcoming paper on recent economic developments in New Zealand for an annex describing the monetary policy framework in some detail. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - Reserve Bank would, henceforth, aim at maintaining inflation in the middle of its target range. One concern policymakers had was how to respond to an autonomous increase in capital inflows and appreciation of the exchange rate. The different lags with which exchange and interest rates affected inflation complicated the response. To prevent inflation from undershooting the target range, the Reserve Bank would feel compelled to allow, or promote, a decline in interest rates. If the surge in capital inflows proved temporary and the appreciation was quickly reversed, the temporary decline in interest rates might still impart an inflationary bias in the medium term. With inflation above the top of the target range, this concern was no longer as acute. Given the relatively high current level of interest rates and the slowdown in demand that was under way, the Reserve Bank was confident that inflation was on course to return within the target range in the December 1995 quarter. Any easing before that time, they believed, would be premature. I0 To maintain these firm monetary conditions against the background of a slightly weaker New Zealand dollar, the Reserve Bank lowered its operational target for bank reserves (“settlement cash”) on two occasions in August 1995, thereby increasing the costs to the banks of maintaining appropriate liquidity. Subsequently, short-term interest rates have risen by about 50 basis points to 9% percent. The mission agreed that the monetary policy framework had been effective in maintaining low inflation in the face of a strong recovery, and it generally supported the Reserve Bank’s intention to aim at achieving an inflation rate in the middle of the target range. Notwithstanding the possible existence of an asymmetric relationship between output and inflation,” it noted that the costs ofundershooting the inflation target should not be ignored. In particular, as long as some downward nominal wage rigidities remain, a declining price level would tend to result in higher real wages and unemployment. Even though domestic demand was slowing, the mission believed that the balance of risks remained on the high side of the target range, particularly in light of tightening labor market conditions. Therefore, the mission considered that the present tight stance of monetary policy remained appropriate and should enable inflation to return within the target range in the next few quarters. A topic of the discussion on the conduct of monetary operation was the Reserve Bank’s ability to influence monetary conditions through pronouncements, without changing instrument settings. The mission noted that recent experience suggested that this approach might have lost some of its effectiveness, prompting the August reductions in the “In its September 1995 Economic Forecasts, the Bank announced that, in light of the likely tax cuts, monetary conditions would probably have to remain firm throughout 1996. “The possibility that inflation rises more at activity levels in excess of potential than it falls at activity levels commensurately below potential is discussed in Laxton, Meredith, and Rose, “Asymmetric Effects of Economic Activity on Inflation: Evidence and Policy Implications,” International Monetary Fund, SfuffPapers, June 1995. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - target for settlement cash, which had been unchanged since February 1993. The Reserve Bank should remain prepared to adjust the settlement cash target again, if necessary, to maintain adequately tight monetary conditions. The mission also warned that the switch to a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system for interbank transactions, probably in mid- 1996, could change the relationship between settlement cash and monetary conditions. At the same time, the mission recognized that the RTGS should reduce payment system risks relative to the existing deferred (next day) settlement system. Following a lengthy internal review and extensive consultations with banks, auditors, foreign regulators, and other interested parties, the Reserve Bank is preparing to implement a new regime for bank supervision in January 1996. The new system is based on very comprehensive quarterly public disclosure by banks of their financial statements, all significant risks to which they are exposed (including market risks), and any credit rating they may have. The public disclosure statements will replace the information the banks so far have reported privately to the Reserve Bank. With markets able to appraise risk exposure--the expectation is that new financial service institutions will emerge to play this role-- the Reserve Bank will do away with its detailed rules and monitoring. For instance, while the existing minimum capital adequacy requirement will remain in effect, the large exposure restrictions (for both foreign exchange and credit risks) will be withdrawn. Also, the present guidelines on banks’ internal control systems will be withdrawn; instead, bank directors will be subject to civil and criminal liability for disclosure statements containing false or misleading information. The new system aims to minimize moral hazard, strengthen market discipline, and reduce banking risks. As before, the Reserve Bank continues to have responsibility for maintaining the soundness of the banking system. This will involve monitoring compliance with the public disclosure rules and requirements. Also, the Reserve Bank will maintain a capacity to respond effectively to an event that threatens the stability of the financial system. C. Structural Policies The authorities agreed with the mission’s assessment that structural reforms had played a central role in improving New Zealand’s recent growth performance and its growth potential. In this regard, labor market reforms and trade liberalization appear to have been particularly important. The Employment Contracts Act (ECA) 1991 formed the culmination of labor market reforms that had started in the mid-1980s. By ending compulsory unionism and union registration, and by converting all industry-wide occupational awards into individual contracts, the ECA had radically liberalized wage bargaining.‘* Since the ECA, estimated collective bargaining coverage had declined by about half to about 40 percent of the workforce (in 1994); union membership also appeared to have declined by about half. The decline in collective coverage was mostly due to the collapse of multi-employer bargaining so that enterprise agreements became the norm. Despite the absence of robust evidence, the ‘*The ECA and broader labor market reforms were described in some detail in an annex to New Zealand--Recent Economic Developments (SM/93/117; June 2, 1993). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - authorities believed the ECA had contained wage growth, delayed the emergence of generalized wage pressures, and facilitated strong employment growth. By raising the private returns to skills acquisition, it had also begun to remedy insufficient past investment in human capital, which the Government still regarded as one of the weaknesses of the New Zealand economy. Trade liberalization was being pursued simultaneously along unilateral, multilateral, regional, and bilateral tracks to enhance the competitiveness and improve the efficiency of resource allocation in the domestic economy. Throughout the 1980s and early l99Os, major strides were made in reducing import protection by lowering average tariff rates and eliminating import licensing requirements. The mission commended the authorities for maintaining the momentum of trade liberalization over the past year by adopting all of the necessary legislation to implement New Zealand’s Uruguay Round commitments, and by announcing a !%rther trade liberalization program for the post-1996 period that will reduce tariffs on mast products to 5 percent or zero by 2000. The only exceptions were a few products that had historically enjoyed heavy protection, namely cars, car components, tires, apparel, carpets, and footwear, but here, too, tariffs were being reduced significantly (from 15-20 percent to lo-15 percent). The Government has already announced that a fiuther review will be conducted in 1998, at which time the authorities will determine how to move to a zero-tariff end point. At the regional level, New Zealand had been at the forefront of efforts to eliminate restrictions on trade and investment in a comprehensive and nondiscriminatory manner through the AF’EC forum. Together, Australia and New Zealand were also conducting discussions with ASEAN aimed at facilitating trade expansion. In the agricultural sector, the mission noted that rules governing the operation of the producer hoards continued to distort price signals and inhibit the expansion of trade and investment. The mission, therefore, encouraged the authorities to eliminate the remaining statutory export monopolies in order to facilitate product innovation and market development and enhance the attractiveness of agriculture and related industries to foreign investors. IV. StaRAppraisal New Zealand’s strong economic performance since 1991 is testimony to the success of the sustained implementation of structural reforms and prudent financial policies. Output expanded at an annual average rate of nearly 6 percent in 1993/94-1994/95 and has been accompanied by a sharp drop in unemployment, including a reduction in the number of long- term unemployed. Inflation has remained low by historical and international standards, despite the fact that the Reserve Bank recently breached its inflation target by a small margin. Fiscal performance has improved dramatically, with a sizable budget surplus recorded last year. The external current account deficit has widened, but only moderately, as export growth partly offset strong import growth and higher investment income payments. Although the external debt ratio has declined, it remains high by international standards. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21- The strong economic performance of recent. years has been partly a cyclical phenomenon, reflecting the large output gap that had opened in the early 1990s. However, there is also evidence of an improvement in the potential growth rate, perhaps on the order of one percentage point, driven by an increase in the rate of private investment and more efficient resource utilization. Deregulation of the economy and the maintenance of transparent, predictable, and stable macroeconomic policies appear to have been the key factors. Notwithstanding the improvement in the growth potential, it is clear that the economy cannot continue growing at the rates recorded over the past two years. It is, therefore, in the interest of policymakers to help ensure that the convergence to a more sustainable growth rate is a smooth one. Specifically, they should be concerned with preventing an intensification of inflationary pressures and the consequent need for a sharp tightening of policies that would be potentially disruptive to growth over the medium term. The available evidence suggests that such a slowdown is already under way. Nevertheless, the staff believes that there may still be some intlationaiy pressures in the pipeline. Capacity utilization in manufacturing remains at an historically high rate, and the unemployment rate is approaching levels that could give rise to labor cost pressures. With the economy operating near capacity, financial policies will need to remain tight to ensure that inflationary and external pressures do not intensify. The Reserve Bank is determined to bring inflation back within its target range. However, to avoid unnecessarily high interest rates and exchange rates, which could have adverse consequences for investment, competitiveness, and the growth potential, restraint should be shared by both fiscal and monetary policies. Enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Act in 1994 was an important institutional innovation intended to ensure the continuation of prudent fiscal policies, The staff fully endorses the Government’s long-term fiscal objectives, including the substantial further reduction in net public debt, the achievement of a significantly positive net worth for the public sector, and the establishment of a broad-based, low-tax environment. The staff also believes that the Government’s intentions to continue running budget surpluses in the near term, and to reduce net public debt to below 30 percent of GDP as quickly as possible, are prudent and appropriate. Given the prospect of growing fiscal surpluses under present policy settings, the staff agrees with the authorities that there is likely to be room for a fiscal package aimed at reducing marginal effective tax rates of low- and middle-income families, while still meeting the long-term fiscal objectives. However, as the authorities are aware, tax cuts are not likely to have a major impact on the supply potential, at least in the short term. On the other hand, there are risks to cutting taxes aggressively. Given the high rates of capacity utilization, inflationary pressures could result that would complicate maintaining inflation within its target range. Moreover, the current account could come under upward pressure, adding to the already high level of external debt and compounding this potential source of vulnerability, A further consideration is the need to bolster confidence that the tax cuts will not be reversed Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - over the medium term, for instance, if expenditures cannot be held to their zero nominal growth path. In view of these considerations, the staff believes that the budget surplus should not be declining in the near term. Phased implementation of the tax cuts would permit gauging the economy’s response and would avoid the need for any reversal. As for the particular measures being considered, the emphasis on lowering effective marginal tax rates for low- and middle-income families, combining equity with efficiency considerations, should serve to strengthen popular support for the broad direction of the policy reforms. The staff considers that the monetary policy framework established by the Reserve Bank Act has proven to be highly effective in containing inflationary pressures throughout the economic upswing. The slight target breach in June 1995 does not distract from this success. Notwithstanding the slowing of domestic demand, the tightening of the labor market suggests that the balance of near-term risks remains on the high side of the O-2 percent inflation target range. Accordingly, the staff believes that the present tight stance of monetary policy remains appropnate, and should not be relaxed until there is clear evidence that labor costs are receding, and that inflation is heading back to the middle of the target range. The staff supports the switch in the presentation of the inflation target from headline to underlying inflation as a more useful guide for monetary policy. As regards the conduct of monetary operations, the staff encourages the Reserve Bank to be prepared to adjust the settlement cash target more frequently than in the past to back up its pronouncements on the appropriateness of monetary conditions. The staff welcomes the increased public disclosure requirements for banks as a potentially powerful instrument to bring greater market discipline to bear on their operations and therewith strengthen bank supervision. The sustained implementation of structural economic reforms is now clearly paying dividends in the form of a higher potential growth rate. Deregulation and stable macroeconomic policies have substantially raised the level and efficiency of private investment. Furthermore, labor market reforms have delayed the emergence of generalized wage pressures and facilitated strong employment growth. They have also increased the returns to skills, stimulating private investment in human capital. Trade liberalization maintained its momentum, motivated by domestic efliciency considerations. The staff welcomes the post-1996 tariff reduction program which will reduce tariffs on most products to 5 percent or zero, as part of a longer-term strategy aimed at eliminating all import tariffs. The staff further strongly supports New Zealand’s efforts to promote nondiscriminatory and comprehensive trade liberalization through regional and bilateral fora. In the agricultural sector, rules governing the operation of the producer boards continue to distort price signals and inhibit product innovation and market development. The staff, therefore, encourages the authorities to eliminate the remaining statutory export monopolies of these boards. The staff is encouraged by the Government’s intention to gradually lift the level of official development assistance toward the OECD average. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with New Zealand be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The core statistical indicators for Fund surveillance purposes are all published and on a timely basis (see attached table). Surveillance would benefit especially from the efforts under way to improve the quality of national accounts statistics. The existing CPI is not adequate for assessing monetary policy. 1. National Accounts The large and variable statistical discrepancy between the independently estimated income and production measures of GDP (showing as much as two percentage points difference in growth rates at times) complicates macroeconomic policy making in New Zealand. This is widely recognized by domestic users in the public and private sectors alike. It is also a major concern to Statistics New Zealand (SNZ). Heavily reliant on third- party income for its funding, SNZ has been slow in making improvements in national accounts statistics. Moreover, New Zealand has been moving away from monthly indicators, widely used in other OECD countries for tracking the economy. To remedy the lack of monthly indicators and facilitate the long-run improvement of income-based GDP, the development of a value-added tax database is being considered. The interpretation and reliability of the constant price national accounts are hampered by the fact that they are expressed in 1982/83 prices, with weights dating to well before the reforms that drastically reshaped the New Zealand economy. SNZ has announced that, by end-1995, all constant price series (production- and income-based) will be rebased and expressed in 1991/92 prices. 2. The Consumer Price Index The consumer price index (CPI) accounts for the costs of owner-occupied housing, according to the “acquisitions approach.” The appropriateness of this practice, which dates back to 1974, was confirmed by the 1993 CPI Review Committee. It includes the mortgage interest rate in the CPI basket as part of the financing costs of home ownership, alongside purchase and maintenance costs, with a weight of around 4 percent. Consequently, monetary tightening has the immediate effect of significantly accelerating CPI inflation. In recognition of this issue, SNZ also publishes an alternative CPI measure that excludes the effects of home ownership costs. The Reserve Bank uses an index of “underlying inflation” to guide monetary policy, whereas the staff has decided to present the CPI, minus interest rate effects, in the World Economic Outlook. Another problem with the CPI is that it is available only quarterly, except for the subindex for food, which is available monthly. In principle, the absence of a monthly CPI is a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - ANNEX III handicap to monetary policy, especially given its emphasis on the direct targeting of inflation. The Reserve Bank would prefer, however, that scarce resources available for the CPI be spent on improving the quarterly index, rather than creating a monthly index that would likely be subject to significant revisions and add noise. 3. Government Finance Statistics A recent decision by the New Zealand Treasury and SNZ envisages responsibility for the compilation of Government Finance Statistics (GFS) data being transferred from the Treasury to SNZ beginning in 1996. This should result in more comprehensive GFS data, covering consolidated central government and local government, rather than just budgetary central government as at present. The data will also be more detailed than those which the Treasury has been able to compile since the restructuring of the government financial management system, and more frequent (quarterly, rather than annual).
