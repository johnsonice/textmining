Introduction Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation and the midterm review of the economic program being supported by the third annual arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) were held in Colombo during March l-17, 1995. lJ, '2/, J/ The staff team met with Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and Deputy Minister of Finance G.L. Peiris, Finance Secretary A.S. Jayawardena, Governor H.B. Disanayaka of the Central Bank, and other senior officials. Mr. Hettiarachchi, Alternate Executive Director for Sri Lanka, attended the meetings as an observer. In the absence of sufficiently strong stabilization and reform measures, it was decided not to complete the review and the authorities are working to establish a credible track record prior to possible new program discussions later in 1995. The Executive Board concluded the 1994 Article IV consultation on March 30, 1994. Directors stressed that the Sri Lanka authorities should reduce the rate of inflation, while maintaining growth and a viable external position. To this end, they called for strong fiscal consolidation. Directors also stressed the need to accelerate public enterprise and financial sector reforms, while welcoming the renewed emphasis on trade and tariff reform. Sri Lanka is on the standard 12.month consultation cycle and accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in March 1994. Sri Lanka maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current inrernarionnl transactions. 1/ The staff team comprised Messrs. Otani (head), Carter and Heytens (all CTA), Mr. Leidy (PDR), and Ms. Elliott (Administrative Assistant, CTA). Mr. Neiss joined the mission for the final policy discussions. Mr. Sassanpour, Resident Representative in Colombo, assisted the mission. r/ Midterm review discussions, planned for the summer of 1994, were deferred because of the elections and the postponement of the budget. 2/ The Executive Board approved a three-year ESAF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 336 million (111 percent of quota) in September 1991. Sri Lanka received loans in an amount equivalent to SDR 112 million (37 percent of quota) under each of the first and second annual arrangements. A third annual arrangement in an amount rquivnlent to SDR 112 million was approved in March 1994. Sri Lanka received a further loan of SDR 56 million in April 1994. The remaining balance of SDK 56 million will not be drawn. The prospective Fund position is set out in Table 3.

Political events The success of the opposition People's Alliance in regional elections last March led to the defeat of the United National Party in the August parliamentary elections after 17 years in power and culminated in a decisive victory by Mrs. Kumaratunga in the November presidential election. The People's Alliance has put more emphasis on social issues in their platform. The Government has only a slim majority in Parliament and is focusing on the peace talks with Tamil separatists. A cease-fire was announced in January 1995 but there has been a recent renewal of violence by the separatists. 2. Macroeconomic develo!xnents Since the late 198Os, Sri Lanka has been laying the foundation for sustained economic growth within a more open and market-based environment. The prospects for improved financial stability and better security conditions in most of the country created a favorable investment climate that contributed to reasonable growth and a strong external position. Nevertheless, the country failed to achieve the sustained high-growth/low- inflation path necessary to bring about the fundamental break with the past and reduce its dependence on foreign aid. A weak tax base and an inelastic tax system, together with an inefficient and oversized public sector, limited fiscal consolidation. Moreover, despite some progress, private sector growth and investment continued to be adversely affected by high borrowing costs and a segmented labor market. Economic performance in 1994 was adversely affected by policy slippages associated with the political events. Despite a good harvest, real GDP growth slowed late in the year and averaged about 5 l/2 percent, slightly below the program target (Table 1 and Chart 1). Investment was below expectations. The private saving/investment gap narrowed in 1994 reflecting delays in capital projects, because of the political uncertainties. and a modest increase in saving. While the inflation rate, as measured by the official Colombo consumer price index (CCPI), declined by some 3 percentage points to about 8 l/2 percent, the drop resulted from duty waivers and the impact of cuts in government administered prices of wheat flour, bread, and kerosene. Excluding the effects of these cuts, consumer prices increased by an estimated 11 l/2 percent in 1994. u Civil service wages rose 12 l/2 percent and private sector wages outstripped the increase in the CCPI. Against this background, average underlying inflation in 1994 is estimated to be 12-14 percent, well above the program target. I/ Issues relating to the official price index and estimates of under- lying inflation are discussed in the forthcoming supplement to SM/95/94.

Structural rigidities in the labor market, in particular those related to the Termination of Employment of Workmen Act, continued to constrain employment growth. I/ In addition, the young preferred to remain unemployed for long periods, hoping to obtain coveted public sector jobs. Fiscal performance in 1994 fell well short of program expectations. The overall budget deficit (before grants) rose to 9.7 percent of GDP (Chart Z), and the current deficit increased to 3.1 percent of GDP (Table 4). Although the public debt-to-GDP ratio is relatively stable, its absolute size, 95 percent, and the rising interest bill indicate the increasing need to divert resources to debt servicing. 2/ The poor performance reflected the impact of "populist" relief measures by the previous Government, the fulfillment of election promises by the new Government, and nonimplementation of several measures agreed under the program. On the revenue side, performance was adversely affected by the granting of additional large-scale waivers and exemptions on customs duties and turnover tax and inadequate tax enforcement. Increases in tax thresholds and rate reductions lowered personal and corporate tax yields. Together, these resulted in a revenue shortfall of almost 1 l/2 percent of GDP. Current expenditure overruns were experienced in many areas: overspending on civil service wages and pensions reflected increases in staff levels, pay rises, and cost of living adjustments; despite previou; commitments to a freeze on new hiring, the Government continued to take on additional teachers, and there has been no progress on civil service reform: large supplementaries were needed for the military, but no offsetting revenue measures were taken; and increased welfare payments and lower prices of several key consumption-items led to large subsidies. Increased domestic financing contributed to higher interest rates, increasing debt service. Overall, current expenditure increased to 22 percent of GDP, 3 percent above the program target. Cauital exwnditure and net lending declined to 6 l/2 percent of GDP, reflecting reduced disbursements of foreign assistance and slow project implementation. At the same time, little progress was made to safeguard the core investment program or to eliminate unnecessary capital projects. The overall deficit (after grants) of 8 l/4 percent of GDP was financed principally by selling rupee srcurities to the National Savings Bank and the Employees' Provident Fund. Foreign financing amounted to 1 l/2 percent of GDP on concessional terms for capital projects. '/ Structural rigidities in the. labor market arr discussed in the forthcoming supplement co SM/95/Y4.

Net credit to government increased and private sector credit rose over 20 percent during the year. As a result, broad money growth, at 20 percent, exceeded the program target despite less-than-envisaged foreign inflows (Table 6). The passive stance of monetary policy in 1994 led to wide swings in short-term interest rates on treasury bills during the year (Chart 3). Because of institutional rigidities, the large movements in short-term rates were not fully reflected in lending and deposit rates, which remained broadly positive in real terms. The spread between deposit and lending rates remained large (8-10 percent), continuing to keep up the cost of finance for the private sector. The large spread is attributed to a lack of competition and problems of government-directed credit and inefficiencies in the two state-owned banks. The external position remained favorable in 1994 (Table 7). The overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of SDR 173 million in 1994, smaller than targeted, with the import coverage of gross official reserves remaining at five months. However, lax financial policies and a deteriora- tion in the terms of trade contributed significantly to an external current account deficit of almost 8 percent of GDP, compared with a 6 3/4 percent target. While export volume growth was stronger than anticipated, export prices were lower than envisaged for key goods, most notably garments and tea. Import value growth was broadly in line with program expectations, although volume growth significantly exceeded program expectations. In aggregate, developments on the capital account were broadly consistent with earlier staff projections although the composition differed markedly. A shortfall of almost SDR 50 million in net portfolio inflows reflected net selling activity by foreign investors during the last few months of 1994. This was attributed to political uncertainty and to rising interest rates abroad. Disbursements to the Government fell short of projections, largely owing to slower-than-envisaged project implementation. Sri Lanka maintains a very closely managed exchanse rate, monitoring REER developments and adjusting for inflation differentials. The Central Bank sets intervention points at which it stands ready to buy or sell dollars, guided by a number of factors including a desire to maintain competitiveness, while also attempting to maintain relative stability in the rupee/dollar rate. During 1994, based on staff estimates of underlying inflation, the rupee REER appreciated by about 4 percent (Chart 4). The rupee's close links with the sharply declining dollar, however, reversed the REER appreciation movement in the first quarter of 1995. Despite the continued dollar depreciation through mid-April, the authorities maintained an essentially stable bilateral rate against the dollar. As a result, since the end of 1994, the r,lpee is estimated to have depreciated by 6 l/2 percent in real effective terms.

Structural reforms Only a few of the structural reforms planned for 1994 were implemented as scheduled (Table 8). In the area of tax and tariff reform, the authorities removed the withholding tax on treasury bills in June, but the tax remains on central bank securities. The authorities also incorporated in the 1995 budget a significant improvement to the tariff structure with the consolidation to a three-band system. However, the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)--a value-added tax--to replace the turnover tax and specific duties "as postponed until October 1995. Moreover, a series of financial sector laws still remain in draft form. Public enterprise divestiture "as also halted as the new Government r-e-evaluated its approach to selling off state-owned companies. As a result, only 7 of the 47 enter- prises earmarked under the program for sale were processed, and no action "as taken on divestiture of large enterprises. III. Report on the Discussions 1. Current situation and short-term uolicv issues The discussions focused on the need to restore macroeconomic stability and resume structural reforms in 1995 within the context of a mediwn-term strategy that aims at accelerating the macroeconomic adjustment and reform process. While the authorities accepted the need to pursue bold adjustment policies in the coming months, they also faced political constraints in doing so, particularly in light of ongoing peace talks with Tamil separatists. Thus, izhey wished to be cautious in tightening their financial policies, preferring to effect changes in the latter part of 1995, while expressing a strong desire to continue working with the Fund in articulating their future financial program. To aid in monitoring developments in 1995, the staff team discussed quarterly targets, based on the agreed annual objectives, for the key financial aggregates during the year. 2. Macroeconomic obiectives The macroeconomic objectives for 1995 as set out in the Budget Speech are broadly in line with the original ESAF-supported program. Real GDP & is targeted to be sustained at 6 percent, based on the continued strong expansion of the nontraditional sectors--both manufacturing and services--and agricultural production. Output growth is to be supported by private domestic and foreign investment, accelerated by the increased availability of imported inputs under the ongoing trade reform. HOWeVer, this increase in investment offsets a reduction in capital spending by public corporations. 1/ Public investment is targeted to increase, in line with the Government's development efforts.

National saving is also targeted to rise to 21 percent of GDP. The rate of inflation is targeted at 7 l/2 percent in 1995, excluding the impact of administered price adjustments. With a view to sustaining external viabilitv, the overall balance of payments is targeted to be in small surplus. 3. Financial and exchange rate policies a. Fiscal policies The authorities plan to contain the overall budget deficit (before grants) to 7 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995 and to achieve a surplus on current operations of about l/2 percent of GDP. Budgetary control is to be improved by bringing into the budget several funds and accounts previously excluded. To meet fiscal targets, the Government introduced in the 1995 budget a package of both revenue and expenditure measures to reduce the overall deficit by the equivalent of 2 l/4 percent of GDP. On the revenue side, the measures--worth nearly 2 percent of GDP-- included: increases in excise duties on cigarettes, liquor, gasoline, and diesel; the removal of many remaining import duty exemptions; an increase in the lowest rate of turnover tax; annual fees on luxury and diesel vehicles: and taxes on domestic sales of export industries. Levies on public corpora- tions and fees and charges were also raised. The GST will not produce revenue until 1996. The staff team expressed concern that there could be some revenue shortfall, especially for import taxes, because the Government continues to grant waivers and exemptions, as evidenced by the new duty waiver that was granted for yarn imports in late March 1995. Import taxes were projected to increase by over l/2 percent of GDP to 7 l/4 percent in 1995. despite a lower base rate. The authorities explained that from this year all waivers had to be authorized by the President in her capacity as Minister of Finance, expressing their clear intention to limit the granting of such waivers, and that the forthcoming introduction of preshipment inspection of both imports and exports should reduce tax evasion, once firmly established. The staff team also noted that other revenue might not meet the budget estimates because of subsequent reductions to the new vehicle license fees. The authorities hoped that this shortfall would be covered by higher receipts from other taxes and some expenditure savings. On the expenditure side, the Government intended to limit current outlays to 20 percent of GDP, compared with 22 l/4 percent of GDP in 1994. The budget incorporated 10.20 percent cuts in nonwage expenditure on goods and services, affecting both defeuse and civilian spending. The budget also envisaged savings on wages, welfare payments, and transfers. These savings will be offset, to some extent. by increased subsidies arising from the relief measures taken ill 1994 to reduce the cost of certain staple items. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public8 The major expenditure saving is expected to be in the area of defense exuenditure, which in relation to GDP is 1 percentage point lower than the outturn in 1994. Such saving is based on the assumption of a cessation of major military operations in the North and greater expenditure control. In the past, there had been little means of monitoring or restraining nonwage defense costs so that considerable waste or overruns resulted. In 1995 the military is putting in place standard accounting practices, and all major expenditure plans will be reviewed by a high-level committee. The staff team strongly supported the Government's intention to reduce defense costs but cautioned that this item was frequently underestimated in the past and suggested the need for contingency measures to be available in :he event that the ambitious limit could not be held. The budget assumed that the civilian w bill would increase to reflect grade drift for nonteachers, while teachers receive 40-50 percent increases to their pay scales, as announced in late 1994. No allowance was made for increased average staff levels compared with 1994. The staff team noted that the wage bill in Sri Lanka was already relatively high in terms of GDP, suggesting a need for retrenchment. Although there was a general hiring freeze in place, there would be considerable pressure to exceed the budgeted amount because of the full year impact of the 8,000 teachers hired in May 1994 and further possible teacher hirings. The authorities agreed that every effort would be needed to curb the total wage bill. The cost of subsidizing wheat flour, bread, electricity, and fertilizer will be at least at 1 l/4 percent of GDP in 1995. Furthermore, diesel and kerosene are cross-subsidized by profits from gasoline. The staff team argued strongly that the subsidy on flour and bread introduced in 1994, amounting to at least 50 percent of costs at current world wheat prices, was highly distortionary and inefficient at targeting the needy. In the medium term, the Government intends to substitute the present system of providing subsidies on wheat flour with a more cost effective system to help the poor. It intends to work with the World Bank to formulate such a system. Neverthe- less, no action would be taken at this time. The 1995 budget converted the fertilizer subsidy introduced in late 1994 into targeted income support for small farmers (with holdings of less than three acres). The authorities expressed their intention to phase out this support at the time when the presently high international price of fertilizer declines. Following the mission discussions, however, the authorities announced a return to a general direct subsidy for all users, at an estimated further cost of 0.1 percent of GDP. The cost of servicing the national debt is an ever increasing burden on the Government's resources. While foreign financing continues at conces- sional rates (averaging about 2 percent), interest costs on domestic debt are high, averaging 15 percent in 1994. The authorities agreed that the budgeted provision for interest payments would be inadequate. Furthermore, if monetary tightening raises interest rates, as expected, and if the Government has to fund Central Bank open market operations, the costs could exceed the budget by over SL Rs 2 billion, 0.4 percent of GDP.

Such later measures could include: (i) further raising the defense levy; (ii) increasing the turnover tax rate; (iii) increasing the excise duty of diesel, alcohol, and tobacco; (iv) freezing the level of civil service staff and salaries; and (v) cutting nonwage civilian expenditure on goods and services by limiting budget allocations for the remainder of the year. At the same time, it was stressed that the core investment program should not be subject to ad hoc cuts. The authorities would monitor developments and take necessary steps later. However, they were unwilling to take any immediate action. Furthermore, they felt that, other than possibly increasing the defense levy, they were not able to identify future measures. The authorities are taking measures to increase the pace and effectiveness of implementation of the public investment program and to utilize available project aid more effectively. Capital expenditure and net lending are expected to increase from 6 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 to 8 percent of GDP. Spending is being concentrated on key projects, while nonessential projects are being abandoned. The authorities are taking steps to ensure full funding and proper monitoring of the cabinet-approved core program, which will focus on strengthening the physical infrastructure. These actions are to be carried out with the assistance of the World Bank. The reduction in the fiscal deficit (after grants)--if achieved--will permit a sharp decline in domestic financing, while foreign financing of the key elements in the investment program will continue at 3 percent of GDP. Financing through rupee securities purchases by the nonbank savings institutions will enable a reduction in the level of bank holdings of government debt of 1 percent of GDP. On this basis, both foreign and domestic debt will fall slightly as a percent of GDP, to a total of 94 percent at the end of 1995. Any slippage on the deficit target will require further domestic financing. b. Monetary and credit policies The authorities' monetary and credit policies will be primarily directed at securing a significant reduction in the underlying inflation rate. In line with the targeted output growth and inflation rates, and on the assumption of continued positive real interest rates, broad money expansion is targeted to decline to about 15 percent during 1995. This target is consistent with the staff's assessment of developments in the demand for money. As in recent years, the gradual monetization of the I/ Assuming no major defense or wage bill overrun. 2/ A broad-based tax applied to domestic and international payments, which can be raised by the Government without prior parliamentary approval.

The targeted growth of broad money calls for limiting the growth in reserve money to about 15 l/2 percent. This, together with the projected surplus in the overall balance of payments, would limit the expansion of "et domestic assets to 4 l/2 percent. Net claims against the.Government and public corporations are to decline, allowing a sufficient amount of credit to support private sector activity. If the fiscal performance is worse than projected by the authorities, there would be some crowding out of the private sector and further upward pressure on interest rates. The discussions on the monetary program catered on the means and timing for limiting the growth in reserve money to the targeted level. Developments in money aggregates during the first three months of 1995 confirmed that the pace of broad money expansion continued unabated, with strong demand for private sector credit which the commercial banks intended to accommodate, resources permitting. In the staff team's view, this, together with a likely seasonal credit surge late in the year, argued for immediate monetary tightening, with the Central Bank being given more instruments to conduct such operations. The authorities acknowledged the need to restrain credit growth through issuance of central bank securities, to be followed by the sales of treasury bills to the Central Bank for that purpose. As a first step, the Central Bank agreed to issue a" additional SL Rs 3 billion of its securities in late March and early April. The Central Bank was reluctant to take any further immediate action because af the impact on interest rates that had already begun to rise. 1/ The staff team noted that the authorities could not tighten monetary policy while maintaining low short-term interest rates. It, therefore, urged that the Central Bank closely monitor monetary developments and stand ready to undertake further open market operations later in the year. If necessary, the reserve requirement on bank deposits could be raised. The Central Bank has ceased extending any new medium- and long-term refinance facilities and the existing facility is being phased out. Further, no new directed lending schemes will be imposed on the commercial banks. Interest rates fell at the beginning of 1995, reflecting excess liquidity in the banking system and efforts by the Government to press the banks to lower lending rates. HOWeVer) rates are expected to be higher for the remainder of the year because yields on treasury securities will respond to the tightening of monetary policy by the Central Bank. In the absence of rapid financial sector reform and given the continued dominance of the state-owned commercial banks, spreads between interest rates on deposits and those on loans are unlikely to fall. i/ The Central Bank successfully rolled over SL Rs 3/4 billion plus a" additional SL Rs l/4 billion on March 22, 1995 but limited subsequent issues because low demand resulted in high expected yields. As a result, only SL Rs 850 million of extra central bank securities have been sold. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public11 Because of the premium required to sell central bank securities, the staff team suggested that the Government sell immediately SL Rs 5-10 billion treasury bills to the Central Bank to supply the necessary instruments to carry out open market operations in the short term. The proceeds of the sale would be held in a frozen account. The authorities agreed to review the need for such action. In the longer term, the staff team recommended that the capital base of the Central Bank be increased. c. Exchange rate policy During the 1994 Consultation, the staff had seen room for the real exchange rate to appreciate, in line with market forces that reflected Sri Lanka's continued external strength and the restructuring of its economy. The staff had cautioned that this process should be largely accomplished through nominal appreciation, rather than through inflation. Such an appreciation would probably have occurred if the authorities had not intervened. In the event, the real appreciation that had been experienced in 1994 had reflected higher inflation. The authorities explained their current policy as continuing to retain a competitive exchange rate. In practice, however, they have focused on maintaining broad stability against the dollar. The authorities explained that such stability was important in light of the high proportion of current account transactions denominated in dollars. The staff team pointed out that this linkage had several important implications that needed to be more fully considered, Most important, in view of the dollar's recent sizeable depreciation, the linkage implied a depreciation also of the rupee that could be contrary to market forces. It harbored the significant risk that the market could still bring about a real appreciation of the rupee, but through even higher inflation, that would obviously be detrimental to the reform process. Thus, the.staff team recommended that the practice of focusing closely on the rupee/dollar rate be reconsidered. Greater flexibility in the management of the rate would permit some realignment and limit the impact of sharp shifts in the dollar. Since March 1992, a 1 percent difference separated the intervention points in the exchange rate set daily by the Central Bank and an interbank market has operated within this narrow range. Because of the narrowness of the spread. the interbank rate frequently moves to the top or bottom of the band thereby limiting interbank transactions. The staff team recommended that the spread between intervention points be increased to broaden the scope for interbank transactions. The authorities felt that this option was worth pursuing but that it should be approached gradually, in view of the limited experience with market-determined rates. As a first step, the spread between the intervention points was increased to 2 percent in March 1995. The authorities indicated their intention to increase the spread further if experience with the current spread proves favorable.

External urospects If the fiscal consolidation currently planned for 1995 is realized, the current account deficit target of about 6 l/4 percent of GDP is likely to be met (Table 7). Export volume growth is projected to continue at about the level achieved in 1994 while import volume growth, responding to sharp financial tightening, is expected to move to a lower but sustainable level. Net private transfers should remain robust, surpassing the already high 1994 level owing to a projected rise in interest rates and the demonstrated interest sensitivity of these flows. The capital account is expected to record a surplus similar to the 1994 level, as higher disbursements and small increases in net direct and portfolio investment are offset by sharply rising debt repayments. The overall balance of payments is projected to achieve a surplus of SDR 243 million in 1995, which would result in gross official reserves increasing to the equivalent of about five and a half months of imports. The authorities regarded such a level as sufficient to meet the precautionary objectives of the Central Bank under current and future exchange rate management practices. 5. Structural reforms and social Dragrams a. External sector reform Progress toward liberalizing and simplifying the tariff system in the early 1990s was substantial. L/ The authorities made further progress by reducing the maximum standard tariff rate from 45 percent to 35 percent with the 1995 budget, which consolidated the tariff system further with standard rates of 10, 20, and 35 percent. Although several anomalies remain--some items outside the three-band system and a few specific tariffs--another significant step toward liheralization and simplification was taken when tariffs on all textiles and clothing items were reduced from 50 percent to 35 percent. The authorities are targeting a unified tariff of 15 percent by end-1998. The staff team proposed that a two-band system be put in place for 1996, by lowering the 35 percent band to 20 percent. The authorities were, however, concerned that such consolidation would need prior warning, suggesting 1997 as more suitable timing, Furthermore, protection and revenue considerations might require an upper band of 25 percent, rather than 20 percent. Several miscrllnnrous measures were to be taken in 1994 that would have further consolidated and rntionalized the trade regime. These included the elimination of n special tax on certain imports, the inclusion of automobiles in the thrre-band tariff system. and the elimination of some import automobile licensing restrictions. In the event, the authorities did not proceed with these ~mrxures in 1994 and now exprct to complete these reforms by end-1995.

The authorities indicated that the various import surcharges imposed in late 1993 were allowed to expire at end-1994 Sri Lanka is a founding member of the World Trade Organization. The authorities were pleased with the results of the Uruuav Round. While Sri Lanka had, in most cases, relatively open access to industrial country markets for its manufactured products (owing to its preferential treatment under the generalized system of preferences), the most-favored-nation tariff cuts under the Round were expected to help expand exports of tropical agricultural products. In the area of textiles and clothing, the ten-year transition period for phasing-out of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement would provide adequate time to adjust to a ilew competitive environment. b. Financial sector reform Sri Lanka's financial system is extremely segmented with banking dominated by two large state-owned commercial banks, controlling 60 percent of total bank assets, while the National Savings Bank is paramount in garnering the savings of the public. The latter institution is unable to supply long-term financing to the productive sector because of its role as a captive source of government financing. Discussions focused on the need to implement measures previously agreed under the ESAF-supported program as well as the recent MAE mission's recommendations to improve the efficiency of the financial sector through increased competition and to strengthen banking supervision. The staff team also noted that privatization of the two large commercial banks would be a key to the substantial improvement in the functioning of the financial sector and encouraged the authorities to act in this area. The authorities agreed to enact a comprehensive package of banking-related legislation. Thus, during April-May 1995, the Government will be submitting for parliamentary approval the amendments to the Banks' Acts, the Debt Recovery Act, and the Accounting Standards Act. By the end of the year, the Control of Insurance Act and the amendment to the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance will also be submitted. The Government is also considering strengthening the capabilities of the Central Bank in 1995 by amending the Monetary Law Act to give the Central Bank a clear mandate with price stability as its main objective, and is drawing up a timetable for the implementation of the recommendations of the MAE report. The authorities acknowledged that privatization of the two state-owned banks was a long standing commitment. However, the political feasibility of such a move was in doubt. c. Tax reform The 1995 budget announced the introduction of the GST in October 1995 to replace much of the present complex system of indirect taxation. To this end, draft legislation is expected to be submitted for parliamentary approval by May. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public14 - Regarding the structure of the GST and the need t" ensure revenue neutrality, the authorities have made several improvements in the proposed GST to bring it more in line with FAD recommendations, aimed at reducing the distortions in the current system. HOWWelT, certain elements of the proposed structure are still of concern. First, the nonstandard (lower) rate contains a large number of items--posing a risk of revenue losses-- compared with the staff's previous recommendation that these be limited to, at most, five mass consumption items. Second, the number of exemptions leaves some scope for continued distortions. The staff team suggested that, to ensure revenue neutrality, the authorities set the standard rate at 18 percent, consistent with the analysis on yields carried out by outside consultants. In the longer term, the new tax should be modified to compensate for the eventual elimination of the defense levy and the reduction in the scope of excise taxes. On other taxes, the staff team suggested, in keeping with the recent technical assistance report by MAE, that the authorities review the taxation of the financial sector. Currently, tax treatment of various financial instruments differs from one instrument to another, acting as a deterrent to financial market development. The authorities are currently considering ways to improve the equity and transparency of the system. d. Public enterprise reform With a view to rationalizing and accelerating the divestiture process, the Government established in March 1995 the Public Enterprise Reforms Commission. The Commission is entrusted with the task of reformulating the strategy for privatization. Under the new approach, union opposition to divestiture would be lessened by their involvement in discussions and the full implementation of provisions for redundancy compensation. The Cabinet approved a plan for full or partial divestiture of government holdings in most of the 47 enterprises earmarked under the third-year ESAF arrangement, primarily through the Colombo Stock Exchange. In addition, the Commission will focus on divesting part of the government holdings in Air Lanka, the National Development Bank, duty free airport shops, and the plantations. Later, other large state-controlled enterprises will be dealt with, although there are no plans to divest ownership of the two large commercial banks. Apart from SL Rs 4.5 billion allocated to the 1995 budget, the proceeds from the sales will be set aside for debt reduction. However, the staff team noted that, under the new approach, the Government intended to retain control through majority or "golden" shares of many major companies, reducing the potential for private ownership to improve efficiency and ease labor market rigidities. e. Poverty reduction and social welfare "rograrns Sri Lanka has made considerable progress "ver the past two decades in improving human welfare through increased investment in health care and education and through various social welfare schemes. Nevertheless, while Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public15 some social indicators (literacy and access to medical services) are high by international standards, others remain low, 1/ and the hostilities in the North and East region have resulted in additional problems. Moreover, the budgetary cost has been high because of the insufficient targeting of the relief measures. Thus, the 1995 budget streamlined the welfare system, replacing a number of schemes providing food and kerosene stamps, school meals, and interest payments to over 1.6 million families with a unified scheme. The Samurdhi (Prosperity) program targets 100,000 very poor families and a further 1.1 million poor households to receive grants in cash and savings accounts. Beneficiaries will be chosen by local officials according to standard criteria. The new scheme, projected to start in June, is intended to be less expensive than the earlier arrangements because the scheme targets a smaller group of beneficiaries and provides an "exit mechanism" by which people whose circumstances improve will not continue to receive payments. The staff team encouraged the authorities to focus on improving screening of beneficiaries and to consider reducing further the coverage of the Samurdhi payments in order to provide greater relief to the truly needy. The authorities should continue to provide refugee aid outside the Samurdhi scheme. In the medium term, incorporation of the North into the welfare system would provide a further challenge. 6. Adiustment in the medium term The 1995 budget was cast within a three-year framework and stressed the importance of accelerating growth to reduce poverty and unemployment within a liberal, market-oriented economic environment. The staff discussed a policy agenda for the medium term (1995-98), designed to assist the Govern- ment in achieving sustainable economic growth and a viable external position in the context of improved price stability. Resolution of the ongoing civil conflict would, of course, be of fundamental importance for the success of any economic policy measures. The Government's medium-term strategy set out in the Budget Speech aimed to achieve by 1997 a reduction in inflation to 5-6 percent, an increase in output growth to 8 percent, and a reduction in the external current account deficit to 5 percent of GDP. These targets are generally consistent with the staff's medium-term framework (Table 2). However, the staff team argued that, without rapid structural reform, the Government's growth target would be difficult to achieve in the near future. The staff team also proposed inflation and external current account deficit targets by 1998 of no more than 4 percent, and 4 percerlt of GDP, respectively.

Both of these are predicated on a sharp swing in public savings, from an estimated negative 3 percent of GDP in 1994 to about 4 percent by 1998. Private savings would increase only marginally over 1993 levels. Thus, the staff team suggested that gross investment be increased from 27 percent of GDP in 1994 to 29 percent by 1998. Public investment, providing an important supportive role, would be stable at 8 percent of GDP, exclusive of any major reconstruction in the North and East, but would be of a higher quality owing to the elimination of nonessential projects. The authorities argued for higher levels of gross investment, closer to the 32-35 percent of GDP achieved in other Asian countries, pari passu with a slower reduction in the external current account deficit. The staff team was concerned about the country's ability to absorb such levels of high- quality investment. a. Fiscal adiustment The staff team proposed a fiscal path that would aim to eliminate the primary deficit by 1996 and reduce the debt/GDP ratio to about 80 percent and the interest/tax revenue ratio to about 15 percent by end-1998. These targets would require the overall deficit (including official grants) to be progressively lowered to 2 l/2 percent of GDP by 1998 through improved revenue performance and tight current expenditure control. Revenue would be increased by eliminating waivers and exemptions and broadening the tax base, while the staff proposed significant reductions in defense costs, the civilian wage bill, and subsidies. In line with the overall target, the balance on current operations could become decisively positive at an early stage, reaching a surplus of 4 percent of GDP by 1998. Another issue over the medium term, if the peace process is successful, would be to fit the reconstruction program into the envisaged fiscal framework. 1/ In support of fiscal retrenchment, monetary policy would aim at a significant reduction in the rate of inflation. To this end, domestic liquidity growth is targeted to decline in a phased manner to about 12 percent by 1998. Sustained fiscal consolidation would also lower interest rate premiums on public borrowing. Lending interest rates are projected to reflect this. b. Medium-term balance of payments DrosDects The staff's baseline scenario assumes substantial fiscal consolidation supported by a tightening of monetary policy over the medium term as well as a resumption of structural reform in the near future. Under these assump- tions, the external current account deficit is expected to narrow to about 1/ Table 9 presents a scenario which accommodates a five-year SL Rs 65 billion reconstruction program. One-third of the reconstruction expenditure is assumed to be offset by cuts in other expenditures and the remainder to be covered by concessional foreign financing. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public18 4 percent of GDP by 1998 (Table 7). This assumes that yearly import volume growth stabilizes after 1995 at about 8 l/2 percent while export volume growth remains at about 11 l/2 percent through 1998. Total concessional lending is assumed to remain roughly stable through 1997, and then to taper off. The ratio of total foreign aid (official transfers plus loan disburse- ments) to GDP is assumed to decline from about 6 l/2 percent in 1995 to about 5 l/2 percent by 1998. Although portfolio investment is expected to remain modest, direct investment is projected to increase significantly as private investment expands and public enterprises are divested. Under this scenario, the import coverage of gross official reserves should be stable at about five and a half months through 1998. To illustrate the impact of less favorable policy actions than assumed above, the staff has prepared an alternative scenario in which the fiscal consolidation and accompanying monetary tightening are delayed (Table 10). Such a scenario would leave Sri Lanka with more macroeconomic imbalances, adversely affecting growth potential. The higher costs of debt service would put further strain on the expenditure side of the budget. 7. Other issues a. Environmental issues With a relatively low population density, Sri Lanka's environmental problems are not as severe as in other countries in the region. Nonethe- less, significant deforestation has occurred since independence, and air and water pollution are emerging problems. The Government is slowly develcping the legal framework and institutional capability to enforce necessary protection. Major initiatives in 1995 include laws on industrial emission standards and a reforestation effort, assisted by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. b. Statistics The timeliness and quality of economic statistics have been generally adequate for effective surveillance. However, the staff remains concerned about the deficiencies in the Colombo consumer price index (CCPI) relating to an outdated weighting system and consumption basket. These deficiencies were accentuated in 1994 as downward adjustments in key administered prices led to the CCPI substantially understating the underlying rate of inflation. Also, the use of the CCPI in the computation of several components of the GDP deflator may be overstating real GDP growth. These deficiencies hamper the authorities' and staff's ability to analyzr macroeconomic and financial developments and to formulate appropriate policies. The authorities were encouraged to compile more accurate indices and seek technical assistance. c. Risks of external crisis and cnuacitv fo rci~av the Fund Sustained resumption of hostilities with the Tnmil separatists could weaken the external payments position. So also could uncertainties over the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 commitment to sound economic policies. The authorities believe that any crisis would, however, likely develop only slowly owing to the low level of foreign portfolio investment, the relative insensitivity of the main scwrces of inflows (direct investment, loans from donors and workers' remittances) to short-term political factors, and the controls on capital outflows currently in place. Although the level of reserves is comfortable and the staff team concurred with the broad assessment of risk, the mission stressed the need to tighten financial policies to maintain that position, Debt service to the Fund peaks in 1999, amounting to about 1.5 percent of exports of goods and services or the equivalent of 3.2 percent of gross official reserves. lJ The prospects for sustained medium-term viability, capacity-to-repay indicators, and the authorities' excellent payments record support the conclusion that Sri Lanka should be in a position to continue to discharge its obligations to the Fund in a timely manner. IV. Staff Appraisal Sri Lanka made considerable efforts to improve financial stability, sustain external viability, and correct structural weaknesses in 1991-92, under the first and second annual ESAF arrangements. However, financial and structural policy slippages in 1994, during the third-year arrangement, clearly undermined the past achievements, although economic growth has thus far continued and the external position remained viable. In this context, the staff views as critical the new Government's intentions to reassert financial control and resume progress in structural reform. The staff supports the authorities' monetary and credit objectives directed at significantly reducing the underlying inflation. To this end, broad money growth needs to be targeted at about 15 percent during 1995. HOWWer, in view of continued rapid expansion in monetary aggregates in the early months of 1995 and a likely seasonal credit surge later in the year, a significant tightening of policy needs to be achieved as soon as possible to ensure that the liquidity growth will be contained as targeted. This tightening should be effected through the decisive use of open market operations and, if necessary, an increase in reserve requirements. It is inevitable that these policy measures will, at first, result in higher short-term interest rates. Because the reserve requirements are already high, imposing a high cost on financial transactions, monetary policy in the longer term should seek to reduce dependence on such ratios. The staff welcomes the ambitious targets set for the 1995 budget which, if realized, would represent a sharp improvement over the 1994 outturn. I/ Debt service and capacity to repay are assessed in the context of long-term balance of payments projections through 2004, which assume that broad policy objectives and strategy remain as drfined over the medium term (Tables 11, 12, and 13). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - Nevertheless, the overall deficit target is still high in the context of the Government's medium-term fiscal objectives and falls well short of the objective set in the ESAF arrangement. Furthermore, the structure of expenditure has not improved--spending on wages and subsidies remains high, and there isroom for better targeting of social and other core expendi- tures, There is also significant risk that actual revenue may not meet expectations and the expenditure outturn will exceed the budgeted amount. Under these circumstances, it is crucial for the authorities to control expenditure tightly, and closely monitor budgetary developments. The authorities are reluctant to take further fiscal measures in the current sensitive political climate. Nevertheless, the staff recommends that measures be taken immediately to offset the potential overrun on expenditures. Raising the defense levy could provide significant additional resources for 1995 if implemented soon. The authorities should be ready to use other measures, affecting both revenue and current expenditure. The staff welcomes the authorities' commitment to implement an adequately financed core investment program, designed to meet key infra- structure needs and to complement expanding private sector investment. Should the authorities embark on a massive reconstruction program for the North and East region, a careful review needs to be made with regard to the macroeconomic implications in the coming years. The authorities' actions in 199& to reduce wheat flour prices and introduce fertilizer subsidies are costly to the budget and adversely affect producer incentives. By providing benefits for those outside the targeted welfare group, these subsidies also compromise support for the truly needy. Given the authorities' objective of increasing the efficiency of the welfare program and more generally that of the economy as a whole, the subsidies should be phased out and replaced by a well-targeted, cost effective system of social transfers. The present level of the rupee's exchange rate is broadly consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals, real export growth, and a viable external payments position. Nevertheless, because the dollar has acted as a strong focal point in exchange rate management decisions, the rupee has closely followed dollar developments. The authorities should guard against letting exogenous dollar developments determine the alignment of the rupee against other major currencies and allow a greater role for market forces in exchange rate determination. In light of the above, the recent increase in the spread between the Central Bank's foreign exchange intervention points is welcome and a further increase would broaden the scope for interbank market transactions without relinquishing substantive control over exchange rate developments. This policy action would allow greater responsiveness to market signals and would also render monetary management more effective in Sri Lanka. Maintaining momentum in structural reform is essential to Sri Lanka's medium-term developmental goals. In this regard, in addition to a further Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public21 - rationalization of the tariff system, it will be crucial to focus on: (a) the implementation of financial sector reforms: (b) the introduction of civil service reform; and (c) restructuring and divestiture of public enterprises. The adoption of a three-band tariff system with a maximum rate of 35 percent was a significant step toward further trade liberalization, and the staff welcomes the authorities' intention to proceed unilaterally over the medium term toward a unified tari.ff of 15 percent. Accordingly, the next step in tariff reform would be t.c axuxnce immediately that a &o-band system would be introduced in the 1996 budget, with a view to introdusing a uniform tariff of 15 percent by January 1998. ThE staff welcomes efforts being made to implement long overdue financial sector reform and urges the authorities to' submit the outstanding legislation without delay. Focus can then be given to increasing the independence of the Central Bank and the efficiency of other financial institutions. The privatization of the state-owned commercial banks would provide a large stimulus to these efforts. The recent public sector wage increases have highlighted the critica need for civil service reform including significant retrenchment, Accordingly, with the help of the World Bank, the authorities should formulate and implement a comprehensive program to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of the civil service, while resisting demands for further wage increases and a liberal public sector employment policy. Strong efforts must also be made to contain the cost of the pension bill. The recent establishment of the Public Enterprise Reforms Commission and the determination to begin the divestiture of some large public entities is commendable. There is concern, however, that the Government wishes to retain control over most of the enterprises scheduled for reform. Focus should also be given to reducing labor market rigidities in both the private and public sector. Success for the authorities' medium-term economic objectives will require immediate monetary restraint, decisive fiscal consolidation, and rapid structural reform. Lowering the burden of public debt servicing is essential to permitting adequate government expenditure while facilitating the expansion of the private sector. The deficient price index has complicated the assessment of macro- economic developments and policies. The staff urges the authorities to devise more accurate price indices. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12.month cycle.

Role of the World Bank in Sri Lanka Since Sri Lanka became a member of the IBRD and I3A in 1'154, ttze World Bank has approved 12 loans totaling $131.1 million <r&t of cancellations) and 68 credits totaling $1.677.2 million (net of cancellations). Sri Lanka became a member of IFC in 1970 and 17 investments totaling aboklt $40.9 mil- lion (gross) have been made to date. During FY 1989-94, the World Bank Group approved 19 credits (totaling $745.3 million). A central element of the World Bank's current strategy in Sri Lanka is the achievement of a more sustainable growth pattern in the medium term through export-oriented development based largely on the private sector. In line with this strategy, the Bank's lending program has supported development of productive activities in agriculture and private industry. In addition, the Bank has supported energy and transportation infrastructure development. IDA has also extended two credits in support of the Government's structural adjustment efforts to establish a climate conducive to private investment. The Bank and IDA's past involvement in aariculture (about 32 percent of total lending) focused on the expansion of paddy production and rehabilitation of the vital tree crop subsector. IDA will continue its support in identifying and removing bottlenecks to agricultural growth, strengthening extension services, and in restructuring state institutions in the sector. Bank and IDA lending for industry (about 25 percent of the total) has supported a broad range of large-. medium-, and small-scale industrial enterprises, primarily in the private sector, through support of industrial development finance institutions. In the future, the Bank Group will support privatization through the policy dialogue, and, when appropriate through technical assistance. IDA lending will support industry mainly by supporting development of the capital markets. In transwrtation, Bank and IDA lending (14 percent of the total) is directed at easing transportation bottlenecks. It supports rehabilitating and upgrading of the road network, institutionalizing proper maintenance methods, and improving sectoral planning of policies and programs. Bank and IDA lending for energy (16 percent of the total) has provided financing for power transmission and for distribution projects. The future program will accord relative priority to energy conservation and the establishment of a fund that would finance private investment in power as well as other infrastructure. In the future, IDA expects to extend credits to improve the environment. The first would probably support improvement of liquid industrial waste and solid waste disposal in the Colombo area. 1/ Prepared by World Bank staff. The figures are as of December 31, 1994.

Chief among these are the Economic Restructuring Credit (ERC) and the Public Manufacturing Enterprise Adjustment Credit (PMFAC). The ERC (approved in May 1990) amed at supporting the program of refornis outlined in the policy framework paper for 1989-92. The PMEAC (approved in November 1990) aims at supporting the Government's plans for public enterprise reform and envisages privatization of a number of enterprises. The PMEAC also aims at improving the efficiency of those enterprises that are to remain in the public sector and closing public enterprises that cannot be transformed into viable concerns. In addition, 8 percent of Bank and IDA lending supported social sector developments. The most recent credit in the social sector was a Poverty Alleviation Credit (PAC). The PAC aims at' sustainably reducing poverty through: (1) a credit line to the poor for self-employment and microenterprise development, including technical assistance and entrepreneurial development: (2) a nutrition component; and (3) a rural works program aimed at providing wage employment to low-income families in areas of acute unemployment. The Bank has chaired the annual Sri Lanka Aid Group meetings that have provided a forum for aid donor consultation since the 1960s. The last Aid Group meeting was held in April 1995.

The loan amount totaled $1,638.3 million, including $14.1 million from OCR and $1,624.2 million from ADF resources (including $1.0 million to the private sector without government guarantee). The AsDB provided two loans for $130'.0 million in 1994. The AsDB has also provided $35.4 million as grant financing for technical assistance for project preparation and institution strengthening. In addition, since 1988 the AsDB has approved five private sector investment facilities amounting to $6.3 million. The AsDB's medium-term lending program is generally directed toward: (i) accelerating the rate of economic growth; (ii) improving the access of the poor to productive assets and making more productive use of their most abundant asset--1abor; and (iii) protecting and improving the environment. These objectives are consistent with the Government's development priorities and its public investment program (1994.98). The AsDB's lending to agriculture (about 40.6 percent of the total) has been supporting the Government's efforts to identify, assess, and modify policies to improve productivity in agriculture, utilize established market price mechanisms to ensure efficient allocation of resources, and promote the development of a more diversified and commercialized agricultural sector. The AsDB will continue to support the Government's policy of creating a climate conducive to private sector participation in growth and investment in the agricultural sector. The recent introduction of private sector management for the state plantations and policy reforms in the fisheries and livestock subsectors will be further encouraged. In the financial and industrial sectors (accounting for about 20.X percent of total lending), the AsDB's lending has focused on the provision of credit lines through participating financial institutions as a means of providing assistance to private enterprises. More recently, the AsDB has provided assistance for the development of the financial sector and has supported initiatives to improve the policy and institutional framework of the sector. This included promoting the establishment of private financial institutions in the fields of merchant banking, unit trusts/mutual funds, leasing, and venture capital, and reducing the role and influence of the state-owned banks in the sector. Industrial sector operations have supported divestiture of government-owned enterprises and increased private sector involvement. Future assistance will be in the form of policy-based lending to open the economy to domestic and foreign competition and investment.

Future AsDB operations and assistance in the power subsector will not only be directed toward investment but also toward policy aspects in the sector, particularly the full autonomy of the electricity agencies through appropriate pricing, improved operation and maintenance, and institutional strengthening. In the social sector (16.1 percent of total lending), the AsDB's activities have been focused on improving the quality of health, education, and water supply services, together with institutional strengthening in the social sector. Future assistance will support human resource development, particularly in the secondary level of education and technical and vocational training. The AsDB has provided assistance for roads and telecommunications development (11.7 percent of total lending) and will continue to support road improvement with an emphasis on developing the capacity of domestic private sector contractors.

Staff assessment The Sri Lanka authorities have typically provided economic data-- including key information on international reserves and exchange market intervention--to the Fund on a regular and prompt basis. Thus, the timeliness and quality of economic statistics have generally been adequate for effective surveillance. 2. Outstanding statistical issues a. Real sector The deficiencies of the Colombo consumer price index (CCPI) related to its outdated consumption basket and weighting system (the CCPI covers 219 items from a 1949-50 family expenditure survey of 455 families in Colombo and has a base year of 1952) continue to be an area of concern. These deficiencies became accentuated in 1994 in the face of widespread downward adjustments in administered prices that led to the CCPI substantially understating the underlying inflation. In addition to this shortcoming, the use of the CCPI in the computation of several components of the GDP deflator appears to result in an overestimation of real growth. These deficiencies in the CCPI have hampered the authorities' and staff's ability to analyze macroeconomic and financial developments, and thus to formulate proper policies. The authorities have been reluctant to adopt a better index owing to the tradition of using the CCPI to determine cost of living adjustments for civil servants and workers covered by the wage boards. However, the recent complications in analyzing macroeconomic and financial developments arising from the deficient price index heighten the need for devising an alternative price index. Consequently, during the recent mission, the authorities agreed to explore the options available to develop an alternative index. The outdated consumption basket and weighting system aside, the methodology employed in compiling the CCPI appears to follow international standards and recommendations. The timeliness of the national accounts and the lack of quarterly data are also of concern. The data transfer process between the line ministries and the Central Bank was streamlined somewhat in late 1993 and the preparation period for provisional national accounts estimates has been shortened by about two weeks. The authorities began compiling half-yearly national accounts statistics on an experimental basis in 1994. If this experiment proves to be successful, the compilation of quarterly national accounts could commence in 1996.

Government finance Government finance statistics continue to cover the operations of the budgetary central government and three special funds. The feasibility of expanding the coverage to include the operations of the agencies with individual budgets is being reviewed. c. Monetary accounts Several revisions were undertaken to the monetary data in January 1994. First, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury account was reclassified in the Central Bank accounts from other items (net) in domestic liabilities to foreign liabilities. Second, the counterpart assets of the reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits held by the commercial banks was reclassified from foreign assets in the commercial bank accounts to foreign assets in the Central Bank accounts. Finally, the SAF/ESAF rupee account included in foreign liabilities of the Central Bank was revalued to reflect changes in the rupee/SDR rate. The authorities agreed in January 1994 to distinguish between resident and nonresident foreign currency deposits in the monetary data. The Central Bank began to compile the relevant data on the various types of foreign currency accounts from commercial banks in late 1994 and the monetary data will be revised in the coming months. There is a long-standing issue concerning the consolidation of the Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) into the monetary survey. The authorities agreed in principle in January 1994 to treat FCBUs as resident institutions in the monetary data. The methodology for doing so is being reviewed by the authorities and the staff with a view to consolidating the FCBUs into the monetary survey later in 1995. d. Balance of navments I" January 1995, STA requested clarification from the Central Bank regarding discrepancies in the reported data between freight and insurance figures for imports and shipment debits for current and historical periods. An inquiry was also made on the rationale for not treating certain payment agreement balances as exceptional financing. The authorities are formulat- ing a reply to these inquiries. 3.
