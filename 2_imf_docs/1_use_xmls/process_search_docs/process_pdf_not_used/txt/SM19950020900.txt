Executive Summary The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Seoul during June 19-30, 1995. 1/ The last Article IV consultation took place in September 1994. . Backeround: The Korean economy entered a strong expansion in 1994, which gained further momentum in the first quarter of 1995. It is estimated that the economy is now operating at or slightly above potential. Consumer- price inflation has so far remained subdued but with growth expected to remain strong there is a risk that it may start co pick up. . Policv issues: The immediate issue for macroeconomic policies is to avoid a buildup of inflationary pressures. Over the medium term, the main policy challenge is to deregulate Korea's highly interventionist system, in particular, to implement the Government's plan for financial liberalization and external capital account opening. The main challenge for macroeconomic policies is to achieve the Government's goal to bring inflation down to partner-country levels (i.e., from around 5 percent to 2-3 percent) while avoiding sharp swings in economic activity, and to deal with the implica- tions of greater capital mobility for the balance of payments and the exchange rate. . Policy recommendations: With the balance of risks shifting toward a pickup in inflation, the staff recommends restrained financial policies supported by greater flexibility in the exchange rate. __ As regards monetarv policy, the growth of the M2 aggregate should quickly be brought back into its target range consistent with the medium-term objective of lowering inflation to partner-country levels. -- The scope for support from fiscal uolicv is circumscribed by the need for significant increases in expenditure on social overhead capital. A moderate degree of restraint is nonetheless feasible, and can be achieved mainly through the operation of the automatic fiscal stabilizers. -- The small real effective depreciation of the exchange rate since the beginning of this year is contrary to cyclical requirements; some appreciation is called for. In the context of gradual external capital account opening, there should be greater upward exchange rate flexi- bility than allowed in the past. lJ The staff team comprised Messrs. Adams (head) and Borensztein, Ms. Schulze-Ghattas, Messrs. Tzanninis and Hirschhofer (EP), and Ms. Rooz (Staff Assistant) (all CTA). Mr. Kang, Alternate Executive Director, also participated in the discussions.

Korea's economic statistics are of high quality and are Fund is-: reported to the Fund on a timely basis. J./ Korea has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains a system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. II. &onomic Setting 1. J%e current exuansion The present expansion began in 1993 after an abrupt downturn in 1992 that was in large part the result of a sharp tightening of policies to bring inflation under control (Chart 1). The recovery was initially hesitant, supported mainly by a temporary revival of construction investment, but gained momentum in 1994, with GDP growth increasing to 0 l/2 percent as a result of buoyant exports and equipment investment. The performance of exports, which sparked off the investment boom. reflected rapid market growth in partner countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, and substantial gains in competitiveness vis-A-vis Japan due to the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar since 1993. Given the composition of demand, activity was particularly buoyant in the manufacturing sector, with output growth accelerating from 5 percent in 1993 to over 12 percent in 1994 (Chart.2). While consumer price inflation in 1994 was affected by a bad harvest, underlying inflation (consumer prices excluding fresh foods and energy) remained broadly unchanged at just under 5 percent (Chart 3). Producer prices picked up in the latter part of 1994, reflecting mainly an acceleration of import prices for raw materials. Largely due to a marked increase in special bonus payments, average hourly eernings in manufacturing picked up in 1994. outpacing productivity gains by a small margin.

In marked contrast to the delayed response of policies in the previous expansion, macroeconomic policies began to move toward restraint early in the current expansion. u The surplus of the consolidated central government rose slightly to 0.5 percent of GDP in 1994, reflecting underruns in expenditure as well as buoyant revenues. Monetary policy was tightened in the second half of the year. H2 growth moved temporarily toward the lower end of its 14-17 percent target range. accompanied by a rise in short- term interest rates of some 2 percentage points.

Following a moderate depreciation during 1990-93, the won appreciated by 2 l/2 percent against the U.S. dollar during 1994, and by l/2 percent in real effective terms (Chart 5). 2. Recent developments and short-term outlook With the momentum of growth expected to remain strong, the authorities' policies for 1995 envisaged somewhat greater fiscal and monetary restraint than in 1994, accompanied by a wage guideline limiting average increases to 7.1 percent. The 1995 budget of the consolidated central government implied a small withdrawal of stimulus compared with the 1994 budget, against which it was formulated. The target range for M2 growth was lowered to 12-16 per- cent. With monetary expansion in the first half of 1995 exceeding the upper limit of the target range (year-on-year basis), the yield on three-year corporate bonds was relatively stable (Charts 6 and 7). 1/ Against the background of a broadly balanced external payments position, the won continued to appreciate gradually against the U.S. dollar but depreciated by 2 l/4 percent in real effective terms during January-Hay 1995, reflecting the sharp decline of the dollar against the yen. Economic activity in the first quarter of 1995 strengthened considerably, underpinned by continued rapid expansion of exports and equipment investment and a pickup in consumption and construction investment. u GDP growth accelerated to almost 10 percent (year on yea=), reflecting in part the special effect of a turnaround in agricultural output. Industrial production expanded at an average rate of nearly 14 percent (year on year) in April-May pointing to continued rapid growth in the second quarter. Largely due to sustained pressures from prices of imported raw materials, producer-price inflation picked up further in early 1995, reaching 5.9 percent in June. Consumer-price inflation, however, has remained subdued and declined somewhat. The recent divergence between consumer prices and producer prices marks a departure from historical behavior and appears to reflect, at least in part, the temporary effects of recent measures to increase competition in the retail sector. Wage developments in the first quarter of 1995 have been relatively favorable, u The yield on three-year corporate bonds has traditionally been an important indicator of monetary conditions on account of its largely market- determined character. u The strong performance of exports in 1994 and early 1995 against the background of a relatively modest real effective depreciation of the won in the last few years reflects a greater apparent sensitivity of Korean exports to exchange rate changes than in the past associated, in part, with the moves into higher technology products with mire elastic demand.

However, the moderation of wage increases reflects partly a shift from special bonus payments to improvements in nonwage benefits. As a result of the continued surge of imports, the current account deficit in the first five months of 1995 turned out more than twice as large as in the same period last year, but remains moderate in relation to the size of the economy. The deficit was financed largely by short-term capital inflows as the long-term capital balance was weak, reflecting a small increase in Korean direct investment abroad and moderate net outflows of equity capital notwithstanding the increase in the limit for foreign stock market investment in late 1994. 1/ The balance of payments recorded a small surplus over this period while international reserves increased further, largely as a result of valuation effects associated with movements in key currency exchange rates. Official and private forecasts for 1995 have been revised upward several times since the beginning of the year and now point to growth exceeding 9 percent for the year as a whole, with some moderation expected in the course of the year from the exceptionally rapid pace in the first quarter. Machinery orders suggest continued strong growth of equipment investment albeit at a slower pace than in the first quarter. Exports are expected to benefit from the real effective depreciation of the won earlier this year which is likely to offset the projected moderation of demand in partner countries. There are also indications of a likely strengthening of construction investment and consumer demand. On the basis of current policies and the level of the real effective exchange rate in Hay, staff projections indicate that growth could reach almost 10 percent in 1995 before moderating to a little over 8 percent in 1996, above the estimated growth of potential (7 l/2 percent). The staff estimates that the rapid expansion in the first quarter has largely closed the remaining output gap and that there is the prospect of a small positive gap for the year as a whole, which could widen in 1996. The current account deficit is projected to increase to 2 percent of GDP in 1995 but to decline slightly in relation to GDP in 1996 as the growth of imports moderates in line with the slowing of equipment investment. In light of the assessment of the present level of resource utilization and the relationship between output gaps and inflation observed in the past, the staff does not expect much of an increase in consumer price inflation in the remainder of 1995 (Box I). However, while estimates of potential are subject to significant error margins, a with the prospect of growth &/ In December 1994, the limit on foreign ownership of a company's shares was raised from 10 percent to 12 percent. The ceiling was increased further to 15 percent on July 1, 1995. u In retrospect, it seems that both the staff and the authorities may have underestimated the remaining slack in the economy last year.

The divergent behavior of consumer and txcducer mites: While both, consumer and producer prices have been affected by significant swings in agricultural prices in 1994 and the first half of 1995, underlying price developments (excludiig agricultural prices) have been characterized by a continued subdued behavior of consumer prices and a pickup of producer prices. These divergent price developments differ from the relationship between the hvo price indices observed in the past. They have been attributed to structural measures ta enhance competition in the retail sector, including masues to facilitate the shortening of distribution chains and increase competition in the distribution system for imported consumer goods. However, the dampening effect on consumer-price inflation of such one-off measures is only temporary and likely ta wane once the implementation of the measures is completed.

Price develomnents and the structure of the extxmsion: Price developments in Korea have been closely related ta resource pressures as measured by estimated output gaps, but the link appears to depend on the structure of the expansion. Reflecting differences in pricing behavior in the traded and nontraded goods sectors, as well as differences in the impact on the labor market, expansions which have been concentrated in the exportaiented manufacturing sector have tended to be associated with more moderate price pressures than expansions in which the more l&or-intensive construction and services sectors played a dominant role. The present expansion, like that of 1986- 88, has been characterAd by strong growth of expats and equipment investment. The composition of demand has been reflected in strong growth in the manufacturing sector with growth and resource utilisation in other sectors lagging behind. By contrast. consumption and construction investment played a dominant role in the expansion of 1990-91. accompanied by strong resource pressures in the construction and services sectors and relatively moderate pressures in manufachxing. These resource pressures were reflected in a rapid acceleration of inflation in 1990.91, while in 1986-88 inflation remained initially relatively subdued but began ta pick up as the stluctllre of the expansion shifted toward the nontraded goods sectors. I/ This box is based on a background study ‘The Inflation Process in Korea” (forthcoming).

Moreover, as the expansion broadens beyond the manufacturing Sector as a consequence of consumption and construction investment becoming more important contributors to growth, pressures on prices could emerge even in the event that the positive output gap does not increase significantly. In addition, it is likely that consumer prices will start responding to the cost pressures evident in recent producer price developments, as the temporary effects of recent structural measures in the retail sector wane. III. Policv Discussiong 1. Macroeconomic policies With inflation remaining subdued and growth strong, macroeconomic developments in 1994 and thus far in 1995 have been favorable. However, with output estimated to be at or somewhat above potential, and rapid growth expected to continue, the balance of risks is shifting toward a pickup in inflation. Against this background, the discussions focused on the degree of restraint required to ensure a "soft landing" consistent with the authorities' objective of avoiding an acceleration of inflation in the short run and to set the stage for further progress toward their medium-term goal of bringing inflation down to partner-country levels. The authorities and the staff agreed that a gradual convergence to partner-country inflation was desirable. The staff suggested that a modest tightening of financial policies should be supported by more flexibility in the exchange rate that would permit some appreciation as the balance of payments strengthens. The authorities broadly agreed with the staff's assessment and policy recommendations but noted that it might be politically difficult to take all the required steps toward restraint before there are clear signs of a pickup of inflation. a. Monetarv policy Monetary policy in Korea is conducted within the framework of a target range for the growth of broad money (M2). u While the target formally applies to the 12-month growth rate for December, u the authorities have generally tried to keep M2 growth within or close to the target range during the course of the year. Nevertheless, monetary targeting has been handled flexibly and temporary overshooting within the year has frequently been permitted to accommodate shifts in money demand and avoid sharp increases in interest rates. Consistent with the objective of bringing inflation down to u The framework of monetary policy in Korea is discussed in the background paper "Monetary Policy: Framework, Targets, and Instruments" (forthcoming). 2/ Monthly average basis. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - partner-country levels over the medium term, the target range for M2 has been progressively lowered in recent years. At the same time, the range has been widened to further enhance the scope for flexibility in targeting M2 in light of the impact on money demand of the ongoing structural changes in the financial sector. The authorities and the staff agreed that the move toward a more restrained stance in the second half of 1994 was timely and appropriate (Table 1). Even though H2 growth had accelerated to 17.6 percent in December 1994 (H-month rate), exceeding the 14-17 percent target for the year, on an annual average basis H2 increased only by 15.6 percent, with short-term interest rates at year-end some 2 percentage points higher than in late 1993. In the first half of 1995, monetary policy had partly accommodated faster-than-expected growth, with rates of monetary expansion (12-month basis) exceeding the 12-16 percent target range and short-term interest rates fluctuating around the level attained in late 1994. J./ The authorities indicated that notwithstanding the rapid growth of M2 in the first half of the year, they intended to meet the December target. In view of the acceleration of M2 in late 1994, the staff observed that bringing H2 growth to the top of the target range relatively late in the year could still imply a significant degree of monetary accommodation during the year, with the possibility of M2 expanding at an annual average rate of close to 17 percent. Given the objective to slow demand growth to a more sustainable pace, the staff suggested that monetary policy should lean toward greater restraint by bringing H2 back into the target range well before the end of the year to about 15 percent (12-month basis). This would imply an annual average rate of monetary expansion of close to 16 percent, and would be expected to be accompanied by e possible rise in short-term interest rates of, perhaps, 50-100 basis points. While in principle not opposed to an earlier and more pronounced slowing of M2 growth, the authorities expressed concern about the potential implications for interest rates. They noted that further increases in domestic interest rates would further widen the already large Interest differential between Korea and international financial markets, u and raise the incentive for capital inflows, which could undermine monetary control. The staff argued that, in an environment of increasing capital mobility associated with the liberalization of the external capital account, the scope for monetary tightening depended critically on exchange rate policy. While the extent of capital controls still in place suggested that sterilized foreign exchange market intervention could continue to play a u The target range was formulated on the basis of projected real GDP growth of 7 l/2 percent, 5 percent inflation, and an assumed further decline in trend velocity of 2 percent. u The short-term nominal interest rate differential between Korea and the United States is estimated to be around 7-g percentage points.

The staff also pointed out that the large underlying differential in real interest rates was the result of controls on capital transactions and would be expected to narrow over time as capital account liberalization proceeds. Regarding the stance of monetary policy in 1996, the staff noted that the medium-term objective of bringing inflation down to partner-country levels would imply the need for some slowing of monetary growth and a possible further lowering of the target range for ML?. At the same time, flexibility in monetary targeting remained essential to accommodate unforseen shifts in money demand resulting from the ongoing structural changes in the financial sector. The staff pointed out that with informa- tion on M2 growth becoming increasingly difficult to interpret, other monetary indicators, including interest rates, would need to play a more important role. b. Fiscal Dolicv The staff discussed with the authorities the scope for fiscal policy to make a contribution to macroeconomic stabilization in 1995 and 1996 against the background of the general condition of the public finances and the Government's medium-term fiscal objectives. Owing to a strong tradition of fiscal conservatism and tight budgetary control, the public sector finances in Korea are sound (Table 2). While the range of tasks assigned to the budget has increased over the years, the size of the Government has remained relatively small in relation to GDP, U fiscal deficits have been kept under control, and, as a result, government debt has remained low. Focusing mainly on medium-term expenditure priorities, fiscal policy has tradi- tionally paid only limited attention to the cyclical impact of the budget. At present, a key medium-term objective of fiscal policy is to raise spending on social overhead capital by a significant margin in order to ease bottlenecks that are increasingly becoming an impediment to growth. The planned expenditure increases are to be financed by higher revenue that would largely come from a broadening of the tax base in the context of a tax reform to be implemented in the coming years. and some scaling back of other expenditure categories. 2/ In addition, the private sector is to be directly involved in some infrastructure projects. The authorities feel lJ In 1994, total consolidated central government expenditure and net lending amounted to 19.8 percent of GDP, below the average for industrial countries, and also lower than in most developing countries. See background paper on "Fiscal Policy: An Overview" (forthcoming) for additional information. ZJ The planned tax reform was discussed in the staff report for the 1993 Article IV consultation (SM/94/19), and in the report for the 1994 Article IV consultation (SM/94/220).

Given the high priority assigned to social overhead capital spending, which appears justified. the staff agreed with this view but suggested that there was still scope to adjust the phasing of the planned measures to ensure that the fiscal position is consistent with cyclical requirements. In addition, the expenditure program did not preclude allowing the automatic fiscal stabilizers to operate during a period of strong growth. The authorities concurred with this assessment and indicated that strong revenue performance in periods of rapid growth could play an important stabilizing role. Regarding fiscal policy in 1995, the staff argued that cyclical conditions called for a moderate degree of restraint which would require a surplus of close to 1 percent of GDP on a consolidated central-government basis. u The staff's revenue estimates, based on budgetary performance thus far, already point to a very favorable outcome on account of stronger- than-expected economic growth, which, together with normal small expenditure underruns, could yield a surplus of about 0.8 percent of GDP. This suggests that the desired outcome could be achieved with relatively minor additional measures &' and without significant cuts in priority expenditure categories. While noting that present revenue estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty, the authorities broadly agreed with this assessment. The possibility that growth will continue above potential in 1996 suggests that fiscal policy should aim to avoid adding to resource pressures next year, and, if feasible, imply a moderate withdrawal of stimulus. The staff pointed out that this would require framing a budget consistent with a fiscal outturn for 1996 which, in relation to GDP, should be at least as strong as the expected outturn in 1995. This could be achieved by bringing forward some of the planned tax measures intended to raise the revenue ratio over the medium term, the automatic stabilizers and, perhaps, through some adjustment in the phasing of planned expenditure measures. The authorities agreed with the basic thrust of the staff's argument but noted that preparations for the 1996 budget had just begun and a decision on the overall position had not yet been taken. They indicated, however, that the budget was likely to be a conservative one and that it was not expected to add to resource pressures. c.

The staff's assessment of the Korean exchange rate is based on developments in competitiveness and the reserve position. In recent years, Korea's underlying current account position has been relatively stable with an average deficit of 1 l/2 percent of GDP. While reserves have increased at a faster rate than imports since 1992, the present import cover (2.6 months) is close to the level in the late 1980s and not high by international comparison. In the staff's view, these developments suggest that the exchange rate is within a range consistent with underlying fundamentals. The modest depreciation this year, however, has been contrary to the cyclical requirements of preventing a pickup in inflation. Against this background, the staff discussed with the authorities the contribution exchange rate policy can make to macroeconomic stabilization in 1995-96. The staff argued that the tightening in financial policies would need to be supported by an adequate degree of exchange rate flexibility. In particular, the exchange rate should be allowed to move up in response to the strengthening of the capital account expected in the period ahead. As regards the medium term, the staff suggested the need for greater exchange rate flexibility to deal with the pressures associated with the gradual opening of the capital account. The discussions also covered the operation of the market average (MAR) system, which limits daily fluctuations in the won/dollar rate to a band around the weighted average exchange rate in the interbank market on the previous day. Since the introduction of the system in March 1990, the margins have been widened several times and are currently +/- 1.5 percent. Notwithstanding the gradual widening of the margins, however, daily movements in the won/dollar rate have tended to be very small, averaging less than +/- 0.25 percent. The staff supported the Government's plan to further widen the band with a view to moving eventually to a freely floating system but wondered about the present significance of a further widening given that not much use was made of the flexibility already provided by the existing band. The authorities were, in principle, sympathetic to the desirability of greater upward flexibility in the exchange rate. They pointed out, however, that it was also necessary to maintain an adequate level of reserves in relation to imports and. perhaps, to raise the import-cover ratio further from its current level of around 2.6 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services. In addition, they felt that exchange market inter- vention had an important role in preventing disorderly market conditions. Regarding exchange rate developments in the near term, they noted that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - I Box II: Exchange Rate DeveloPmenu 11 I l L.aneer-run r-4 exchanec rate behavior: Korea’s real effective exchange rate has exhibited wide swings over the last IS years superimposed an a modest downward trend.

They nevertheless accepted that, in the event of a strength- ening in the balance of payments, there could be scope for the exchange rate to appreciate somewhat. 2. Financial sector liberalization and external caDita1 account wenine l/ In Korea's highly interventionist system, the financial sector has traditionally played a key role as an instrument of industrial policy based on preferential credit, and, as a result, has been subject to extensive government regulation and control. Policy-based lending peaked in the late 1970s and has since been scaled back significantly. This process was accompanied by a number of piecemeal reforms during the 198Os, which permitted the emergence of a less regulated nonbank financial sector. Nevertheless, many traditional features of the financial system, such as interest rate controls, mandatory lending requirements, and extensive regulations concerning financial instruments, remained essentially intact. External capital transactions remained tightly controlled and monetary policy continued to rely heavily on direct instruments. With the realization that the development of the financial sector has lagged behind, financial sector reform and external capital account liberalization have now become a top priority for structural policies. A multiyear plan for financial sector reform and external capital account opening was presented in 1993. While the schedule is gradual, implemen- tation has been on, and in some cases ahead of, schedule (Box III). Two key elements of the program for domestic financial sector reform are interest rate liberalization and the move to a fully market-based system of monetary control. Regarding interest liberalization, the staff observed that although most lending rates and almost 70 percent of deposit rates had been liberalized, 2/ these interest rates appeared to have remained quite stable even as other traditionally market-determined interest rates had moved up. The authorities attributed this to lack of competition and slow adjustment to the new regime but agreed that interest rates would be expected to show greater variability in the future. u For further details, see "Financial Sector Reform and External Capital Account Opening" (forthcoming). 2/ The figure refers to the shares of deposits with liberalized rates in total deposits as of June 1995. It does not take into account the liberalization of a number of short-term time deposit rates and some lending raters in July, subsequent to the consultation discussions.

In addition, P foreign exchange reform plan, covering tbe period 1995-99, was presented in 1994, which broadens tbe scope of tbe external side of tbe reform program. Tbe program focusses on tbe following w-as: l bterest rate liberalisation: In line with tbe plan’s schedule, interest rates on most loans (except policy loans backed by funds that are eligible for interest subsidy) have been liber-alized, as have interest rates on deposits with maturities longer than two years, and a range of deposits with shorter maturities. All remaining loan and deposit rates, except those on demand deposits, are ta be liberalised by 1996. Tbe libemlilation of demand deposit rates will be considered in 1997. l Restrictions on short-term financial instruments: Restrictions concerning mahnities, minimum denominations and issue limits for short-term financial instruments such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit have been successively essed. In 1996-97, the phasing out of all remaining restrictions on existing instruments will be considered and new short-term instruments such as money market certificates and money market funds will be introduced. l Monetarv uolicv instruments: ?be plan envisages P move to P fully market-based system of monetary control by 1997. An auction system for monetary stabilisation bonds and repurchase agreements has been introduced but a significant share continues to be allocated on B mandatory basis. Tbe8e mandatory allocations are to be phased out by 1997. Global ceilings for Bank of Korea (BOK) rediscounts, previously open-ended for tbe retinaacing of policy loans, have been introduced in 1994. However, the BOK discount rate remains well below market level, and there has been, so far, no move ta adjust it, although tbis step is scheduled for 1994-95. A gradual reduction of reserve requirements is planned for 1996-97. l Credit controls and lendine aidelines: Regulations forcing financial institutions ta set aside a certain share of their loan portfolio for small- and medium-size enterprises have gradually been eased and are to be phased out by 1997. At the same time, credit ca~trols pertaining ta large conglomerates have been eased and will eventually be limited to prudential regulations. 0 ~oreinn excbanee svstem: Reform of tbe foreign exchange system focuses on tbe easing of documentation requirements, most of which have been waived @ut not abolished); tbe easing of restrictions on banks’ foreign exchange positions, which are to be reduced to a level necessary for prudential reasons; and tbe gradual widening and eventual phasing out of tbe margin8 for daily exchange rate fluchrations. 0 Canital controls: Tbe libendization of tbe capital account includes measurea to facili-tate foreign direct investment, and ease restrictions on portfolio investment and other capital transactions. Measures taken so far bawincreased the access for fore& investors to tbe domestic stock market, facilitated outward portfolio investment, and eased some foreign borrowing restric- tions. In addition, some steps have been taken to reduce the remaining restrictions on import timming. ‘The plan envisages only limited access for foreign investors to tbe Korean bond market and only a gradual easing of restrictions on direct foreign borrowing by Korean firms.

In order to further the development of a well functioning money market, such mandatory allocations should be discontinued. Greater flexibility in the Bank of Korea's discount rate, which according to the reform plan is to be introduced in 1995, was also en important step toward a more market-based system of monetary control. External capital account liberalization has so far mainly focused on enhancing the access for foreign investors to the Korean stock market by gradually raising investment limits, most recently in July this year from 12 percent to 15 percent. L/ In addition, some steps have been taken to facilitate access to foreign capital markets by Korean firms, outward portfolio investment, and foreign direct investment. Many restrictions remain, however, particularly regarding foreign access to the Korean bond market and direct foreign borrowing by Korean firms. u In en effort to broaden the program for external capitol account opening, a new multiyear plan, the Foreign Exchange Reform Plan, was presented in late 1994. While the plan covers most relevant areas of capital account liberalization. it lacks specificity and leaves open the possibility of significant controls remaining in place after its completion (1999). The authorities feel that a more specific plan would limit their flexibility to implement measures in line with overall macroeconomic conditions. The staff noted that a well- defined schedule containing specific measures would underscore their commitment to capital account opening and would provide clear signals to market participants. IV. Staff Aouraisal The Korean economy has continued to perform very well. Led by strong exports and equipment investment, the growth of real GDP accelerated to almost 10 percent in the first quarter of this year, and it is estimated that the economy is now operating at or somewhat above potential. consumer price inflation has been subdued, with the underlying rate hovering at a little below 5 percent during the last two years. The external current account deficit has widened during the course of the expansion but nevertheless remains moderate in relation to the size of the economy. u These investment limits refer to the shares held by foreign investors in relation to a company's total shares. In addition, investment by a single foreign investor is limited to 3 percent of a company's shares. There has been no change in the 3 percent limit since the partial opening of the stock market in 1992. u In 1994, foreign investors were permitted to purchase certain types of bonds that carry below market interest rates.

Based on the most recent data, inflation remains subdued end there are es yet no indications of significant resource pressures. There is the risk, however, that growth, even though projected to slow somewhat, will continue to be very strong end that the ongoing shift in the composition of demand towards consumption and construction will contribute to price pressures. In addition, given the present level of resource utilization, the faster rate of increase of producer prices in the first half of this year may start to feed into consumer prices es the temporary effects of structural measures to increase competition in the retail sector wane. Against this background, the staff believes that timely moves toward restraint in macroeconomic policies would be prudent to avoid a buildup of inflationary pressures. Monetary end fiscal policies, supported by greeter upward flexibility in the exchange rate, can play a role in this endeavor. This would obviate the need for a much sharper tightening at a later stage should inflation start to pick up, end would increase the prospects for e "soft lending." The authorities broadly concur with the staff's assessment but feel that it may be politically difficult to take all the required measures before there are clear signs that inflation is starting to pick up. Within the framework of the relatively wide target range for the M2 aggregate in 1995, monetary policy can make a contribution to forestalling an increase in inflationary pressures. Following a sharp acceleration et the end of 1994, M2 has been somewhat above the upper end of its target range during the first half of this year with the result that short-term interest rates have been relatively stable even es growth has accelerated. To help slow demand to a more sustainable pace, the authorities are encouraged to bring the growth of M2 beck within the target range relatively quickly, to around 15 percent (12-month basis). This would be expected to be accompanied by smell increase in short-term interest rates. Looking beyond 1995, the staff supports the authorities' objective of gradually reducing inflation to partner country levels es the best contribution monetary policy can make to macroeconomic stability. Ongoing liberalizatton of the financial sector is likely, however, to make the relationship between M2 end prices more unstable end M2 growth rates increasingly difficult to interpret. In these circumstances, a number of indicators, most notably market-determined interest rates, should also be monitored end the staff welcomes the authorities' intentions in this regard. Fiscal policy should also play a role in preventing an increase in price pressures. In light, however, of the need to raise investment in much needed social overhead capital the contribution will likely have to be relatively modest. An appropriate objective would be to aim for a moderate withdrawal of stimulus in 1995 which would require a fiscal surplus this year of around 1 percent of GDP, somewhat larger then in 1994. This would be feasible without cutbacks in needed investments in social overhead capital as much of the improvement is already coming from higher revenues associated with faster-than-expected economic growth. As regards 1996, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - fiscal policy should avoid adding to resource pressures end, if possible, lean toward restraint. The smell reel depreciation of the won since the beginning of the year is not helpful in the effort to prevent the emergence of resource pressures. The authorities should allow the exchange rate to move up in response to the expected strengthening of the external capital account to help avoid a buildup of inflationary pressures. More generally, the authorities are encouraged to allow greeter flexibility in the exchange rate by making full use of the scope offered by the current margins of the MAR system end, in line with stated policy intentions, to continue to widen the margins with a view to moving to a freely floating exchange regime over the medium term. The staff welcomes Korea's comprehensive program of financial sector liberalization. Most lending end a large pert of deposit rates have been liberalized, end progress has been made in scaling back policy loans. Notwithstanding the progress, however, there appears to have been limited flexibility in the structure of deregulated interest rates. It is hoped that interest rates will show more flexibility es the financial deregulation progrem proceeds. A key element of financial sector reform is the move toward a fully market-based system of monetary control. Important steps have been taken in this area but progress appears to have been a little slow. The authorities should make faster progress in these area which would not only strengthen monetary control but could also help to foster the development of e more efficient financial sector. The broadening of the program for external capital account liberaliza- tion in the Foreign Exchange Reform Plan presented last year is welcome. However, es the plan lacks specificity in the later stages, it is difficult to gauge the scope end pace of the envisaged liberalization. There is the possibility of a number of significant constraints on the external capital eccount remaining et the end of the plan. A well-defined schedule containing specific measures for the various stages would underscore Korea's commitment to capital account opening end would provide clear signals to market participants end the international community. Korea's economic sCatistics are of high quality end ere reported to the Fund on a timely basis. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Korea take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Sentember 12. 1994 Executive Directors endorsed the thrust of the staff appraisal for the 1994 Article IV consultation with Korea. They commended the authorities for the remarkable record of growth and development that has been achieved over the last three decades. They attributed this sustained *ucces* to a high investment rate supported by a high private sector saving rate, a conservative fiscal policy, a strong emphasis on education and the accumulation of human capital, and a long-term and increasingly outward orientation of the economy. Directors supported the authorities' central objective of completing Korea's transformation into an advanced industrial economy through the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and a sustained movement away from interventionist microeconomic policies to a fully market-based approach. Directors agreed that, with the economy approaching full employment, the main challenge for macroeconomic policy is to sustain the economic expansion, inter alia, by *voiding a renewed bout of inflation. Economic growth had shown continued strength while the unemployment rate had dropped further to just over 2 percent. But the rate of inflation had picked up, primarily because of adverse movements of food prices. Therefore, Director* cautioned that, with tight labor market conditions, the ca*e for early action to tighten financial policies was clear. and that such a tightening would allay the need for more difficult measures at a later stage. Directors observed that the task of containing demand pressures was complicated by the prospect of continuing large capital inflows. They took note of the authorities' concern that such inflows could contribute to inflationary growth of the money supply or an appreciation of the won, with implications for export competitiveness. Directors agreed that a *et of policies emphasizing fiscal restraint and such structural mea*ure* .a* liberalization of imports and capital outflows could help to address the authorities' concern. Given the need for fiscal policy to play a greater role in restraining aggregate demand in view of the current cyclical situation. Directors noted with satisfaction that the recently passed supplementary budget related to reform of agricultural imports wzs fully funded by additional revenue from a newly introduced tax. As regards fiscal policy for 1995, Directors underscored the need for a significant withdrawal of stimulus and welcomed the authorities' recent decision to aim for a surplus in the 1995 budget. While Directors were fully aware of the difficulty of achieving such a fiscal stance--particularly given the authorities' commitment to strengthen - over - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - ANNEX III . infrastructure and improve the provision of public goods more generally- they stressed that insufficient fiscal tightening at this juncture would further complicate the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies. on monetary policy, Directors noted the record of success achieved by the Bank of Korea with its flexible approach to monetary targeting over recent years. Nevertheless, with financial reform moving ahead and patterns of financial intermediation changing, Directors agreed that assessment of the monetary stance would increasingly need to rely on a broader range of indicators in addition to monetary growth rates. They endorsed the Bank of Korea's latest efforts to push up short-term interest rates in order to achieve monetary growth at the lower end of the target band. SC?Veral Directors observed that gradual appreciation of the currency could be expected in the period ahead as part of the process of tightening monetary conditions. A number of Directors emphasized that such an exchange rate adjustment would have a beneficial effect on inflation and that it should be viewed with equanimity in light of the economy's strong competitive position. Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to steady implementation of the structural policy agenda, including financial sector reform, steps to liberalize the external capital account, a reduction of remaining import protection, and a phased reform of the tax system. Directors saw the coordinated reform programs for the financial sector and external capital account as a top priority. In the area of trade policy, Directors endorsed the efforts under way to phase out barriers to agricultural imports, while urging the authorities to go further in that direction. It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Korea will be held on the standard 12-month cycle.
