The staff team’ met with the Secretary of Finance and other senior officials of the national government, as well as the governors and key officials of the four states. The Federated States of Micronesia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on both current and capital international transactions. In concluding the first Article IV consultation with the Federated States of Micronesia on May 20, 1994, Directors underscored the need for fiscal and structural reforms to address the scheduled phaseout of U.S. grants and noted the authorities’ intention to seek international assistance in support of the adjustment program. They stressed the importance of strengthening the fiscal position in a comprehensive manner-including policies to increase tax revenue, restructure the civil service, and reduce overall expenditures--and cautioned against further borrowing on commercial terms. Directors emphasized the necessity of structural reforms to promote private sector activities, noting in particular, the need to rational& iitmcial system regulations, improve the oversight of the banking sector, reform the land tenure system and expand physical i&tstructure. They also highlighted the importance of improving the statistical base. IL Recent Economic Developments A. Background The Federated States of Micronesia consists of four states, Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap. Each of the national and state governments has considerable constitutional autonomy, including its own executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and its own budgetary process. The responsibility for policy coordination among the states is delegated to the national government, but the states’ autonomy and the lack of collective policy objectives have so far constrained efforts to formulate consistent fiscal and development strategies. The national government provides relatively few economic services and has no control over the level and composition of state expenditures, but it is responsible for administering major taxes and fishing rights fees, which together account for nearly three fourths of total domestic revenue and are shared with the states.* In contrast, the state governments collect relatively ‘The mission comprised Ms. Meesook (head), Mr. Parasuk, Ms. Duprat, Mrs. Dayal-Gulati, and Mrs. Eulate (Administrative Assistant), all SEA Mr. Petrie, Advisor to the Executive Director for the Federated States of Micronesia, attended some of the meetings as an observer. The mission also visited the four state capitals. *Of the tax collected in each state, the national and state governments equally share wages and salaries taxes, gross revenue taxes, and import duties; the ratio for sharing fuel taxes is 80:20.

Surpluses of the national government are usually appropriated by the National Congress for state capital projects. The country has developed little of its own productive base beyond subsistence farming and fishing, although agricultural production has diversified over the past decade from wpra to pepper, bananas, citrus products, and root crops. The heavy dependence on external assistance from the United States under the 1986 Compact of Free Association has led to a large government sector, which accounts folr close to half of formal employment, and for which salaries account for roughly 30 percent of GDP. There has recently been a rapid expansion of the deep-sea fishing industry, primarily foreign-owned or in joint ventures with the states. Locally owned enterprises are limited to small-scale businesses for processing garments, pepper, and coconut products; tinily-run retail trade; and hotels and tour operations. The Compact of Free Association provides for a series of block grants over 15 years. These have been gradually reduced and will be entirely phased out by 2000/01;“’ it also provides for some small annual grants earmarked for specified purposes. Financial assistance from non-U. S. sources remains relatively small, largely for the development of social infmstructure and technical assistance fbndedl by the Asian Development Bank (A&B). Since the Compact came into effect, budgetary grants in relation to GDP declined from 83 percent (1986187) to 53 percent (1992/93). Notwithstanding this decline, grant revenue amounted to almost two thirds of total government receipts in 1992/93 and continued to support high levels of domestic wnsumption and imports. Indeed, merchandise imports alone amounted to two thirds of GDP in that year and were over four times as large as exports. Inadequate infrastructure, in particular, of transportation, power, water supply, and sewerage systems; shortages of entrepreneurial and technical skills together with overall high wage rates; and the land tenure system are major impediments to ‘economic growth and diversification. Financial pressures tInat have emerged since the fust stepdown of the Compact grants in 1991/92 prompted the governments to begin to lower expenditures. The burden of this adjustment has fallen largely on capital spending, with implications for the rate at which infrastructure can be expanded. Additionally, external debt and debt-service payments have risen since 1990191, as the national and state governments have borrowed against prospective Compact funds--to invest in the fishing industry and international securities. Returns on these ‘The fiscal year ends on September 30. ‘The annual block grants amounted to $60 million during 1986/87-1990/g 1 and will amount to $51 million during 1991/92-1995/96 and $40 million during 1996/97-2000/01 based on the 1986 dollar and subject to an inflation adjustment.

B. Recent Developments’ Following a contraction of output in 1992 induced by a drought and a severe typhoon, real economic activity expanded by 5 3/4 percent in 1993 (Table 1 and Chart 1). This was attributable to recovered agricultural production, large-scale investments in the fishing and telecommunication sectors, and construction activities financed by external grants. Aggregate demand was further sustained by higher consumer lending. In 1994, output growth weakened to about 1 l/2 percent, as the large investment projects were completed; however, housing construction wntinued to be buoyant. Tourism and related industries remained sluggish notwithstanding an increase in hotel capacity, partly reflecting an economic slowdown in Japan. Agriculture and manufacturing activities also grew slowly. In general, the production and tax base remained narrow and the economy wntinued to be dominated by the government sector. Reflecting declining grants, the consolidated fiscal deficit (1314 percent of GDP) widened in 1992/93 despite a fiuther cutback in both current and capital expenditures. Prehminary data show that the overall fiscal position continued to deteriorate in 1993/94, with the deficit estimated at 4 l/2 percent of GDP. While the national government budget remained in surplus, most states recorded sizable deficits. Domestic revenue declined from the level attained in 1992/93, reflecting a smaller income from the above-mentioned investment in international securities and weaker tax collection (Table 2 and Chart 2). Although overall revenue amounted to 27 percent of GDP, tax receipts remained low by international standards, at less than 10 percent of GDP. On the expenditure side, current outlays were contained slightly below the previous year’s absolute level. Subsidies to government-owned fishing ventures and transfer payments to utilities companies, which had risen in recent years, were reduced, although they remained high at 6 percent of GDP. The impact of limiting new hiring and freezing promotion was minimal; with the total number of civil servants remaining broadly unchanged, wages and salaries continued to rise in line with either automatic step increases or discretionary adjustments to the pay scale. Capital expenditures increased slightly Born 1992/93 but were low by historical standards. Lending by commercial banks increased sharply in 1993, as the one local bank expanded operations substantially, although the Micronesian branches of two U.S. banks ‘owing to the lack of official data on national income, balance of payments, prices, and wages, it has been necessary for the staff to estimate several economic aggregates.

Commemial loans are as a rule of very short maturities, extended to retailers as working capital. In 1994, both deposit taking and lending by commercial banks declined in absolute terms as deposit rates in Mkonesia lagged behind corresponding rates in the United States, while commercial loan rates moved up with the rising U.S. prime rate combined with a modiication in the usury law allowing barks to charge the maximum of 4 percentage points above the U.S. prime rate, instead of the previous 2 percentage points.’ As a consequence, the interest rate spread widened to about 10 percentage points. Long-term loans to production sectors were extended mostly by the Development Bank of the Federated States of Micronesia. Reflecting additional capital contributions to the bank by the U.S. Government, these loans increased rapidly in 1992-94; the growth went mainly to hotel and apartment businesses, fisheries, and construction-related quarrying. The completion of investment projects and sluggish consumer demand led to a deceleration of imports in 1993/94, but the trade deficit widened as export earnings slowed after a few years of rapid growth in the domestic fishing fleet (Table 4 and Chart 3). Heavy interest payments on bond issues caused the external current account deficit (after grants) to rise marginally to 1 l/4 percent of GDP. Partly as a result of scheduled repayments on the above-mentioned borrowing, government f&&al holdings declined to $121 million at end-1993/94 (59 percent of GDP), while the outstanding external debt was reduced to $129 million (63 percent of GDP);’ positive Enancial holdings of the national government net of debt liabilities were more than offset by net debts of the states and public enterprises. The debt service rose to 29 percent of exports of goods and services. Based on staE e&mates that domestic prices rose somewhat more rapidly than in the United States, the real effective exchange rate appreciated slightly during 1992/93 - 1993/94. ‘A monetary survey cannot be presented because of the absence of information on currency in circulation. The analysis of the financial sector is based on banking data. ‘The ceiling on commercial loans is now the 1J.S. prime rate plus 4 percentage points or the savings account rate plus 8 percentage points, whichever is lower, the ceiling on consumer loans remains at 15 percent. External debt comprises government and public enterprise debt and consists mainly of borrowing in connection with investments in fkheries and telecommunication projects and of bond issues in 1990-91 against future Compact funds with the proceeds invested in international securities.

The mission outlined a medium-term adjustment fiamework that aims for a s,hifI in resources Erom the Government to the private sector, in order to enhance the econolmy’s productive capacity and promote external viability. Such a shift will simultaneously require a substantial consolidation of government Gnances and actions to broaden the productive base and employment opportunities, includiig in particular a reduction in government wages to encourage employment in the private sector. The adjustment is also likely to require correctiqg the imbalance between the roles of the national and state governments in revenue collection and provision of services; the actual solution obviously will have to be formulated collectively by the governments. The authorities expressed the hope that confidence in their albility to carry out appropriate policies would catalyze tirther financial and technical support from the international community. Toward this objective, the authorities are formuMng a medium-term structural adjustment strategy; its detailed elaboration in various aspects is expected to benefit from the assistance of the AsDB, which has also agreed to convene the first Consultative Group meeting for the Federated States of Micronesia in late 1995. The ASDB technical assistance is programmed to extend over three years and will also cover training in economic management. The mission took the position that, with only six years of the Compact period remaining, implementation of key policy initiatives needs to commence right away. A. Expansion of the Productive Base Expansion of the productive base through development of private sector activity will require better physical infrastructure, skilled labor at reasonable wage rates, an improved ticial system, and a strengthened regulatolry fiamework. Toward these objectivw the mission advised closer collaboration among the national and st@e governments in the preparation of public investment programs, the design of the institutional hework, and the formulation of sectoral policies. The efficiency of public investment programs should be improved through better coordination of programs among all the governments and more stringent project appraisal procedures in the context of the countrywide policy, which will also help clari$ overall development strategies and maximize the efficacy of aid finance. In this co~ection, it is important that the limited public resources be devoted to inf&tructural development, instead of investment in production activities. Furthermore, a harmonized policy on foreign investment should be established, and the process for its approval-currently required from the national as well as concerned state governments-streamlined. The authorities noted that, owing to the constitutional autonomy of the states, policy coordination has been diicult. Tourism, fisheries, and agri-business have been identified as promising sectors, but there exist no clear sectoral strategies, especially in respect to the development of supporting ix&structure. The mission supported a recent initiative to design a national tourism plan and advised the development of a coordinated strategy for fisheries as well. The expansion of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- tourism is likely to remain slow in view of the authorities’ desire to preserve the country’s social and cultural heritage, compounded by the problems faced by investors in securing land. In view of this situation, large-scale foreign investment has so far focused on deep-sea fisheries, which do not generate significant direct domestic employment. At the same time, coastal fisheries-largely engaged by domestic enterprises-face a potential danger for overfishing and reef destruction. Consequently, the authorities have encouraged more domestic involvement in deep-sea fisheries and pursued options to promote higher value- added fish products. A national strategy for fisheries would help avoid undue competition among the states in granting incentives and facilitate the collective establishment of i&astructure and processing facilities; the formulation of such a strategy can benefit from the technical assistance currently under preparation by the World Bank to help strengthen the institutional capacity for coordinated policies and improve the performance of fisheries parastatals. In this regard, the mission advised that the role of the National Fisheries Corporation should shift from that of an investor to the coordinator of policies and provider of services and technical know-how. The potential for the development of commercial agriculture and agro-industries is favorable, both for local consumption and for exports, but physical and marketing n&structural support would need to be strengthened. Discussions on the financial system centered on the need to enhance the role of banks in economic development through encouraging long-term productive lending and promoting private savings. The recently reactivated Banking Board has focused on the oversight of the banking system.g Regarding banking supervision, an amendment to the Banking Law is under deliberation, aimed at consistency with the current international practice, better prudential standards, and the improvement of enforcement capabilities-including the granting of supervisory authority to the Banking Commissioner. With a view to encouraging lending for productive investment, the mission supported the pending proposals to remove the ceilings on commercial bank loan rates and to mod@ the requirement that the Development Bank lend at highly concessional terms. Although their liberahzation might raise lending rates further, it could also allow deposit rates to move more flexibly, which would in turn help promote domestic savings. However, the mission cautioned against requiring commercial banks to direct credits to specific sectors, for fear of the potential distortionary impact on the allocation of resources and a weakening effect on bank portfolios. In this connection, the mission encouraged the removal of the regulation requiring commercial banks to lend at least 50 percent of their deposits to domestic borrowers; while not strictly binding in practice, it has resulted in boosting consumer loans instead of lending to productive sectors. As in other Pacific island countries, the land tenure system in the Federated States of Micronesia is a major barrier to private investment, both from domestic and foreign sources. In particular, the prohibition of foreign land ownership prevents banks with a foreign interest (including the Development Bank) from taking land as collateral, but there are few alternative assets available for the purpose. Some state governments have initiated a scheme to bypass ‘An MAE expert has been posted as an advisor to the Banking Commissioner. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- this restriction by accepting the land as security in return for underwriting bank loans; in this respect, these arrangements would need to be monitored closely to safeguard the governments’ finances against substandard contingent liabilities. Other difIiculties related to the land tenure system remain to be addressed, such as complications in land leasing arising from multiple ownership; the prohibition of land sales in the State of Pohnpei; and fragmented plots, which render commercial farming diflicult. In this regard, improvements in leasing arrangements-including a lengthening of the maximum lease period and clearer leasing procedures--would permit more flexible land use. The mission acknowledged, however, that the issue is a delicate one, touching upon many facets of the social system, and will need to be dealt with in a social as well as economic context. B. Fiscal Policy, 1994/X-1995/96 Fiscal policy for 1994/95-1995/96 was discussed in the context of &n&mental reforms required in preparation for the reduction in U.S. Compact assistance. Both the national and state authorities indicated that fiscal adjustment is a high priority. Indeed, the 1994/95 Presidential National Budget speech called for substantial fiscal consolidation, with a view to halving the ratio of current expenditure to GDP by the end of the Compact period.” The authorities recognized that the public sector is excessively large and pays substantially higher wages than the private sector, that some duplication in functions exists, and that tax administration is ine&ient. Although the aggregate financial holdings of the governments appear adequate, state governments that have pursued expansionary policy in recent years currently hold little liquid assets and some are overdue in their financial obligations. The mission observed that, however, the approved 1994195 budgets include neither revenue efforts nor significant attempts to reduce the wage bill or subsidies. The national and state governments have each set up a task force on restructuring, but no conchtsions have been reached. On an adhoc basis, some stream&ring of government operations through redeployment of staff resources has commencxxi in some states, but no net reduction in the overall government work force is envisaged. Based on developments so far this year and taking into account expenditure items that were not incorporated into the budgets, a consolidated deficit of 13/4 percent of GDP is projected. Taking into consideration scheduled debt repayments and disbursements of AsDB lending in the pipeline, gross f%rancial holdings of the Government are expected to diecline further, to about 53 percent of GDP by end-1994/95. As a first stride toward government downsizing, the mission recommended that the current hiring freezes be strictly enforced, with positions abolished as employees leave and no new posts created without offsetting elimination of existing positions. On the revenue side, it was recommended that the pending proposal to close loopholes on customs duties-by making all imports by businesses subject to the tax irrespective of whether the goods are for “‘The mission’s medium-term scenario, incorporating a significant but somewhat leas ambitious adjustment, is presented in Section C. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- resale-be resubmitted immediately to the new national legislature as an initial step toward a more comprehensive tax reform.” The mission urged the authorities to incorporate specific actions into the 1995/96 budgets under preparation, aiming at further cuts in the current spending (by about 5 percent of GDP) and improved tax collection (by 1 percent of GDP). Much of the reduction in current expenditure would come from lower transfers to enterprises, as measures to cut the wage bill and outlays on goods and services would take time to implement. These actions would permit capital outlays on Mastructure development to be raised to 20 percent of GDP, a level considered more appropriate in light of the very low level of private investment, while holding the consolidated deficit to about 2 percent of GDP and maintaining government financial holdings at an adequate level of about 50 percent of GDP by end-1995196. Several options to reduce the wage bill were discussed, including early retirements for employees without the appropriate skills; across-the-board reductions in the nominal levels of wages and salaries; a reduction in the number of government work days as an interim solution, together with a commensurate pay cut; and the imposition of mandatory retirement age at, say, 55 years old, concurrently with a lowering of the entitlement age for social security benefits from the present level of 60 years. The last option has received the most serious consideration by all governments but, given the age distribution of government employees, the mission considered the impact of this measure marginal; the mission also noted that in order for the Social Security Administration to maintain a viable position, there would need to be corresponding adjustments in contributions and benefits. Furthermore, the need is critical for a comprehensive restructuring of departments and agencies, for which priority should be set on eliminating overlapping and unnecessary functions. The mission shared the authorities’ position that layoffs of government employees would need to be accompanied by measures to facilitate their absorption into the private sector. The mission was of the view that high public sector wages at present are not conducive to the development of the private sector. To alleviate this problem, the system of automatic step adjustments in the wages prevailing in some states should be discontinued effective with the 1995196 budgets, and any wage increases should be through selective job regrading--directed at particular skills and functions. The mission expressed concern that, in the past, the reduction in current expenditure has severely affected purchases of goods and services, with possible adverse consequences on the ability of government employees to carry out their functions effectively. Notwithstandmg such concern, the mission discussed with the authorities ways in which certain categories of spending can be reduced. In particular, it would be usefbl for each state to re-examine the structure of education and health care so as to enable the provision of efficient services at lower costs, and to disallow abuses of the system. In this connection, the mission noted that there is scope for raising medical fees (presently minimal) and for charging school fees “The national and some state elections took place in March 1995, and the newly formed governments took office in the following May. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- (presently nil through high school). The education system would need to be reoriented toward technical and vocational skills consistent with the new development strategies that will need to be articulated. The authorities recognized the need to adhere to established mechanisms for controlling expenditure within the budgeted amount, which has been a serious problem in the State of Chuuk. For the past few years, the functions of the national telecommum ‘cation service and most state utilities have gradually been separated from the governments; however, many of these still receive large budgetary transfers. The mission suggested that their charges be permitted to increase sufiiciently to cover costs, thereby simultaneously ehminatmg the subsidies and providing incentives to reduce consumption that will, in turn, limit the need for new capital and imports. It was recommend.ed that subsidies to copra producers through the Coconut Authority also be reduced gradually, with procurement prices adjusted to reflect world market prices. Transfers to government-owned enterprises to cover their capital investment and operating losses, specifically in fishing and transshipment activities, should be phased out and the enterprises managed on al commercial basis. In view of several unsuccessful commercial investments, the mission advised that government resources no longer be allocated to such ventures. In this regard, the mission recommended that the authorities refrain from additional commercial borrowing. An immediate concern is the plan by the State of Chuuk to issue shortly additional medium-term bonds against the Compact funds in order to finance its equity stake in a new tuna cannery. In line with the recommendations of the recent FAD report,‘* additional revenue measures that should be implemented in the 1995/96 budgets are the elimination of duty exemptions for public enterprise imports; the extension of wages and salaries taxes to unearned incomes; and increases in surcharges on fuels and state excise taxes. The authorities acknowledged that there is considerable scope for strengthening tax collection through enhanced management of manpower and existing equipment, as well as a better auditing system. The mission advised that priority be given to curtailing widespread tax evasion and delinquency, including through the provision of incentives to individual tax collecting units for improved performance. During 1995/96, preparations should be made for implementing further measures in the context of a medium-term tax reform. C. Medium-Term Adjustment Scenwio The strategy recommended by the mission centered on a restructuring of the public sector and improved i&astru&ure and institutions necessary for private sector development. The fiscal and balance of payments medium-term scenario (Table 5) quantifies the implications of such a strategy, which is expected to be continued beyond the Compact years.

The scenario was prepared at the wnsolidated level. Adjustment efforts required from each of the national and state governments will depend on the degree of existing financial imbalances of each government; wrrespondingly, their needs for technical assistance, in particular in the area of budgetary management, vary across governments. The scenario aims for a reduction in the current expenditure of the Government in proportion to GDP by about one fourth-reaching 45 percent--by 2ooO/Ol. The slower pace of adjustment than that envisaged in the 1994195 Presidential Budget Speech is recommended in order to moderate the negative impact of budgetary cuts on income and living standark, the reduction is still very substantial and will not be easy to effect. To achieve the stafPs target, the wage bill and expenditures on goods and setvices will have to be significantly lowered, while subsidies will be vhtually eliminated--through higher utility charges and wmmercialization of public corporations. The scenario implies a gradual cut in government employment and some decline in the real wages of the public sector in the first few years of adjustment. Greater budgetary allocations will be required for investment programs that will strengthen the physical infrastructure and human resources necessary for private sector development, including retraining programs for retrenched government employees. Capital expenditure is targeted to be maintained at about 21-23 percent of GDP during the period when infrastructure needs are built up, then to level off as private investment and activities begin to take off. The scenario inwrporates the implementation of a tax reform in 1996/97. The mission recommended that import duty rates (presently 3 percent on food and 4 percent on other nonluxury items) be increased and import tariffs on luxury goods and fuels be transformed into excise taxes, with higher rates; the rates on personal income taxes (presently progressive at 6 or 10 percent) should be adjusted upward; and profits taxes should be introduced in place of gross receipts taxes, which tend to deter new investment and give unfair advantage to larger enterprises with vertically integrated operations. These new initiatives are estimated to raise tax receipts to about 20 percent of GDP by 1997/98. In addition, multilateral negotiations for higher fishing license fees together with better surveillance can wntribute to revenue increases. The projections sugge,st that the net financial position of the consolidated government will improve throughout the r emaining Compact period. Although fiscal deficits are projected in the initial years of expanded public investment programs, increasing budgetary surpluses are expected to be attained in 1997/98-2000/01. This fiscal profile would permit gross financial holdings to remain at an adequate level-close to 50 percent of GDP-throughout 1995/96-2000/01, taking into acwunt scheduled debt repayments. However, real output is projected to decline signXcantly during the first two years of fiscal wnsolidation. The deflationary impact of the civil Service and tax reforms will be partly mitigated by higher investment expenditures. Output growth is projected to pick up in subsequent years, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- reflecting the impact of development expenditures that will gradually lay the foundation for private sector development. Given the currently narrow productive base, the output gain will be relatively slow. It is envisaged that by the end of 2001/02, per capita output will be restored close to the pre-adjustment level. Under this scenario, the maintenance of adjustment momentum beyond 2OOO/Ol would depend critically on substantial financial assistance to compensate for the withdrawal of the Compact funds. Consistent with fiscal developments, the external current acwunt is projected to improve steadily. The deficit (before grants) would narrow from 48 percent of GDP in 1994/95 to 26 percent by 2000/01, reflecting improvements in both trade and services accounts. The smaller trade deficit reflects a growing export base and a decline in wnsumer goods imports as domestic production expands. The strengthened services account reflects higher tourist receipts and fishing rights fees, as well as lower interest payments in line with declining external debt as existing wmmercial loans are paid off. Consistent with the assumption of no further commercial borrowing, outstanding public debt is projected to fall from 55 percent of GDP at end-1994/95 to 13 percent of GDP by end-2000/01, with the debt-service ratio declining from 25 percent to 18 percent over the period. D. Statistical Issues Macroeconomic statistics of the Federated States ofMicronesia have improved but remain limited and unreliable in several areas (Annex IV). The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) has provided assistance to improve the statistical base and, at the authorities’ request, coordinated such assistance ftom all external agencies. Banking data are now regularly compiled by the recently appointed Banking Commissioner, and work is under way to compile the consumer price index. However, there continue to be no official accounts of the national income, balance of payments, and consolidated government finance. Consolidated fiscal acwunts, including combined financial holdings, rely on reports of independent auditors or, for more recent years, estimates by the stafFteam. The mission discussed efforts needed to alleviate the situation and to w mmunicate information to the Fund on a timely and regular basis. Toward this objective, it enwuraged better coordination between the states and the Office of Planning and Statistics in the reporting and compilation of statistical data. IV. Staff Appraisal The fundamental macroeconomic and structural imbalances confronted by the Federated States of Micronesia wntinue to be serious. In particular, civil servants’ salaries remain at unsustainably high levels, giving little incentive for private sector development. The f3xmial positions of some state governments are &agile, even though the consolidated government reserves appear to be adequate. The key economic challenge facing the authorities is to meet developmental needs, particularly for infrastructure, and achieve sustained growth while reducing dependence on grant assistance. Fiscal adjustment will need to be the center of these efforts, together with coordinated structural policies to promote Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - private sector activities. The staff supports the authorities’ intention to accelerate fiscal consolidation over the medium term and recommends that a forceful approach be adopted with a view to restructuring the public finances. This will entail reducing the wage bill, enhancing the effectiveness of development expenditures, and improving revenue performance. The authorities plan to approach potential donors for technical and financial support that would underpin these efforts. To assist the authorities in mobilizing such support, the AsDB is providing technical assistance in the preparation of a comprehensive medium-term strategy. The stafFrecommends that the strategy reflect the consensus among all the states and the national government. It is expected that the * through headquarters and the PFTAC, will collaborate closely with the AsDB team in this process. In view of the magnitude of the required adjustment, the stafT considers it important that policy reforms commence with the 1995/96 budgets. A civil service reform should be initiated, with the objectives of substantially reducing the size of the public work force, eliminating redundant functions and consolidating overlapping operations between the national and state governments, and moderating public sector wages. Procedures for budgetary management and expenditure control should be strengthened, with emphasis on lowering the cost of providing social services. The recent separation of public utilities from the governments is a welcome step, and the staEenwurages the phasing out of budgetary transfers to them and to public corporations, as well as a gradual divestiture of governments’ equity interests in these ventures. The reduction in current expenditures should be complemented by raising tax revenue. The staff recommends that priority be given to reducing exemptions and improving tax administration. In addition, efforts need to be made to broaden the revenue base, increase tax buoyancy, and address the imbalance in the division of responsibilities for revenue collection and provision of services between the national and state governments. Development expenditures should focus on the delivery of the necessary i&astructure and services that would support private sector development, instead of investment in production activities. With stronger revenue collection and lower spending overall, the authorities should aim at maintaining gross f&an&l holdings over the medium term broadly at the current level in relation to GDP, to cushion against contingent needs. With a view to containing debt servicing costs, the staffcautions against any further external commercial borrowing. The recommended early pursuit of economic restructuring is designed to smoothen the transition to the post-Compact era. Nevertheless, the short-term outlook will be difEcuk, with declines of output and inwme. In order for the private sector to play a larger role in the economy, nominal wages would need to fYl to the level wmm ensurate with productivity. Such a level might be viewed as unacceptably low in comparison to popular expectations of basic needs-conditioned for decades by the availabiity of U.S. assistance. However, the cost of postponing the adjustment effort is likely to be much higher, with a prolonged recession well beyond the Compact period. There is no easy solution to the problem, and any viable strategy requires a combination of wage restraint and productivity enhancement.

Collaborative efforts among the national and state governments are needed to foster the development of the private sector. The staEenwurages the establishment of a harmonized policy on foreign investment and a coordinated strategy on fisheries as well as on tourism. Impediments to private investment stemming from the land tenure system need to be addressed, with a view to easing di.fkulties in sewring productive land use and accessing credit. The staff supports the proposals to liberalize interest rates and to relax other restrictions on bank lending so as to promote investment and enwurage domestic savings. Basic macroeconomic statistics, including the national income, balance of payments, and consolidated government accounts, are lacking in the Federated States of Micronesia. It is essential that the data base be developed to kilitate economic decision making. Greater cooperation between the national and state governments is required in this effort. The staffis prepared to continue to provide te&nical assistance in improving the statistical base, in particular through the PFTAC, as well as assistance in strengthening the institutions of fiscal and monetary management. It is recommended that the next Article IV wnsultation with the Federated States of Micronesia be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

In September 1993, a country economic report on the Federated States of Micronesia was prepared as part of the second Pacific Island Economies Report. The third Regional Economic Report was finalized in February 1995. This is a thematic report focusing on trade, tourism, fisheries, forestry, and regional cooperation. The Bank has approved a grant of about US$140,000 through the Institutional Development Fund to help improve the institutional capacity for coordinating fisheries development policies across the four states and to improve the performance of fisheries parastatals including privatization. ‘Prepared by World Bank staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public4 - 27 - AN-NEXIII Federated States of Micronesia: Relations with the Asian Development Bank’ The Federated States of Micronesia joined the Asian Development Bank (ASDB) in April 1990. The broad objective of the AsDB’s operational strategy is to assist the Federated States of Micronesia in achieving sustainable and self’keliant growth. The operational strategy includes the AsDB’s leadership role in providing policy advice with special emphasis on donor coordination and supporting structural adjustment together with project financing and technical assistance. The loan and technical assistance support will focus on strategic sectors such as fisheries, agriculture, and tourism with particular emphasis on facilitating private sector growth. Since joining the ASDB, one loan amounting to $6.5 million (fisheries development) was approved. In 1994, four technical assistance (TA) grants were approved (strengthening the Office of Planning and Statistics and the Development Bank enhancement, water supply and sewerage system improvement, power system improvement, and policy advisory team for economic management) amounting to $1.28 million. An annual loan program of about $12 million has been targeted, given the Federated States of Micronesia’s absorptive capacity constraints, particularly the scarcity of skilled labor and other grant assistance available. A possible loan of about $9 million is in the pipeline for 1995. For the technical assistance grant, about $4.45 million is programmed for 1995 covering national fisheries policy and management, strengthening Agricultural Support Services II, transportation infkastructure development, education and skills development, the policy advisory team, and strengthening budgetary systems and procedures. Over the next three years, technical assistance grants are projected at about $2 million per year. ‘Prepared with the assistance of ASDB staE Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-28- Table.

There are presently no official statistical publications at the aggregate level, and no data are transmitted to the Fund on a regular basis. The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) has provided assistance to improve statistics and has been requested by the authorities to coordinate such assistance from all external agencies. A. Real Sector Since 1989, no official estimates of the national accounts have been compiled. GDP estimates have been made by the staff. No price, wage, or aggregate production indicators are available. However, the authorities are in the process of compiling a consumer price index that is scheduled to be available from June 1995. Monthly price data collected from all four states since November 1994 will be weighted by population shares; the weights of diierent items in the consumption basket will be based on the composition of the consumer price index for Palau or the Marshall Islands. A consultant to the PFTAC assessed the need for assistance in compiling national accounts and a consumer price index in March 1994. This was followed up by a visit in November 1994 to further discuss the issues. Technical assistance in the compilation of national accounts has also been offered by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the South Pacific Commission, the UN Fund for Public Accounting, and the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific. B. Government Finance The authorities do not report government finance statistics. Training in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) methodology for publication in m and compilation procedures was provided to a Micronesian official in June 1994. Further development in the compilation of consolidated accounts is dependent on greater cooperation between the national and state governments, required for timely and accurate reporting of data by the states to the Office of Planning and Statistics. C. Monetary Accounts Monetary survey data are not available because of the absence of data on currency in circulation. Drafts of the consolidated balance sheet and supplementary schedules for loans and deposits were received from the recently appointed Banking Commissioner and were reviewed by STA Technical assistance by STA has been postponed, pending further progress on drafting call report forms and instructions for the commercial banks by the Office of the Banking Commissioner. These documents are being finalized and will be received by STA shortly. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - ANNEXIV D.
