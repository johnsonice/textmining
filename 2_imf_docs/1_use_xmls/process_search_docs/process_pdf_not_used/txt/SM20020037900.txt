Zanello (Head), Becker, and Ms. Kongsamut (all APD)-held discussions in Male during October 6-14 with Mr. Jaleel (Minister of State for Finance and Treasury and Vice-Governor of the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA)), Mr. Zaki (Minister of Planning and National Development), Mr. Kamaluddeen (Minister of Human Resources, Employment, and Labor), Ms. Ahmed (Minister of Women Affairs and Social Security), as well as other senior officials and representatives of the private business community. The mission was accompanied by World Bank staff (Mr. Bell). l At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on August 30,200 1, Executive Directors noted that policy performance had deteriorated and the growth outlook had become more uncertain. They urged the authorities to reverse fiscal slippages in order to curb excess demand and benefit from the recent devaluation. The elimination of automatic deficit financing from central bank resources was in their view key to restoring macroeconomic stability and the viability of the fixed exchange rate regime. Directors also underscored that medium-term fiscal and structural reforms were needed to boost growth prospects. 0 Despite improvements in recent years, gaps and inconsistencies in economic data continue to hamper surveillance and policy design. .

Tourism and fisheries-the Maldives’ economic lifelines-are slowly recovering, but have not yet regained the ground lost in 200 1. After over two decades of uninterrupted gains, per capita income likely remained flat in 2002. The pass-through from last year’s devaluation has been contained and inflation is not a policy concern. a The international competitiveness of resorts and fisheries is not at issue and the balance of payments has recently improved. The devaluation and the weaker dollar have brought the effective real exchange rate closer to that of main competitors. Reserves have clawed back some of the losses in the aftermath of the devaluation. a Widening fiscal deficits financed by money creation are undermining the viability of the fixed exchange rate regime. The pattern of central-bank financed budgetary imbalances continued in 2002, adding to the liquidity overhang in the banking sector. Credit growth surged after credit ceilings were lifted, and NPLs are on the rise. 0 Structural reforms are gathering momentum. Important economic laws are in the works; the restructuring of a key state-owned enterprise is to be implemented soon; and the banking sector is adapting to greater competition. Policy Issues 0 There was agreement that fiscal and monetary policy need to be refocused to support the peg. The disappearance of the parallel market after the devaluation suggest that the exchange rate level is broadly appropriate. a The staff urged institutional changes to prevent future deficit monetization. Early passage of the MMA Act and improvements in liquidity management are key to greater operational independence of the central bank. a There was consensus that fiscal consolidation is urgent, but views differed on how to bring it about. The staff suggested measures on both the revenue and the expenditure side of the budget to achieve an adjustment of some 1% percent of GDP in 2003. The authorities are reluctant to increase tourism-related taxes in the weaker economic environment, and think that better expenditure control may suffice. 0 Structural reforms must continue apace to bolster medium-term prospects. Legal reforms and further privatization are needed to foster greater private sector participation and export diversification. Financial liberalization needs to be supported by strengthened supervision. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- 1. INTRODUCTIONANDBACKGROUND 1. The performance of the Maldivian economy was strong through most of the past decade, despite handicaps arising from its small size and vulnerability to external developments.’ Tourism and fisheries gave impetus to real GDP growth, while access to concessional financing and a liberal expatriate labor policy spurred the development of infrastructures and provided a buffer against external shocks. With the benefit of greater stability than in most other small island economies, per capita GDP rose from US$l ,000 in 1990 to over US$2,200 by the end of the decade, and social indicators improved steadily (Annex IV). Yet, economic development has been uneven across the country, and the narrow production and export base remains a fundamental source of vulnerability. 2. In recent years, slower growth and policy inconsistencies led to imbalances which culminated in a devaluation in 2001. Growth slowed sharply in the late 1990s with the end of the boom in resort construction and a worsening terms of trade (Figure 1). Policy developments were characterized by central bank financing of ever-larger fiscal deficits, undermining the fixed exchange rate regime. Structural reforms also stalled. Notwithstanding increasing reliance on administrative controls of domestic liquidity and rationing of foreign exchange, pressure on reserves mounted, leading to a 9 percent devaluation of the rutiyaa against its anchor currency (the U. S. dollar) in July 200 1. 3. In an already weakened macroeconomic environment, the global tourism slowdown of late 2001 brought to the fore the need for a policy reorientation to reinvigorate the economy. The 2002 Article IV discussions presented the opportunity to reassess progress toward restoring the soundness of macroeconomic and structural policies. To ensure a favorable medium-term performance for the Maldives, policies need to support the fixed exchange rate and adapt to ongoing structural changes-notably, the progressive liberalization of the financial sector, further private sector participation in activities still dominated by state-owned enterprises, and the likely tapering off of external assistance. 4. The authorities have made some progress in responding to key policy challenges. Recent consultations have stressed the need for a stronger fiscal position and independent monetary management. First steps have been taken to strengthen the revenue base, for example with the 200 1 imposition of a payment for public land use on state enterprises. A broader tax reform remains, however, on the unfinished agenda, in part for lack of implementation capacity. Control of public spending, including the public sector wage bill, is still a policy priority, as are institutional changes to prevent automatic deficit monetization. Technical assistance from the international community is in train to address these issues. The ’ The Maldives consists of some 1200 coral islands, 200 of which are inhabited, scattered over 900,000 square kilometers of rich fishing grounds. Its population is 276,000. The main export markets are Europe (tourism) and the United States (fish and garments); and the largest import partners are Singapore and Sri Lanka.

Improvements to the legal framework have also been made, although progress has been slow. Finally, the need to strengthen the statistical base has repeatedly been flagged in previous consultations. Some advances notwithstanding, further efforts at capacity building are needed. II. RECENTDEVELOPMENTSANDOUTLOOK 5. Output growth has fallen to around 2% percent in 2002, implying a stagnant per capita income (Table 1). External demand has remained weak, notwithstanding a recovery in tourist arrivals to more normal seasonal patterns, and an expansion in catch-collecting capacity for tuna exports (Figure 1). Domestic demand has suffered from the weakened external sector,2 with only a partial offset from higher government spending. Overall, per capita income is likely not to have grown for the first time in over twenty years. Following a post-devaluation spike, inflation has been kept in check by low world commodity prices and slack demand (Box 1). 6. After a significant loss of reserves in late 2001, the balance of payments has improved. The MMA has relaxed its grip on foreign exchange sales in the wake of the devaluation. In a less constrained environment, growth in dollar deposits resumed (Figure 2).3 With falling export receipts in the last quarter of 2001, reserves bottomed out at the end of the year but have since recovered to about 3 months of imports (Figure 3, Table 2). The current account deficit is expected to remain wide at almost 9 percent of GDP, as gains from import compression have been more than countered by a decline in tourism revenues.4 Official inflows continue to be strong, though, reflecting large capital expenditures underway.5 Private inflows have also picked up with the establishment of two new financial institutions (a leasing company and a branch of a global bank). 2 Tourism and fisheries directly account for 40 percent of GDP and 22 percent of employment. 3 Dollarization in the Maldives has been on a trend that tracks closely the relative importance of dollar-generating activities (tourism and fisheries). It appears to reflect transaction needs as well as asset substitution. 4 Though tourist arrivals are recovering, prices remain soft. 5 The largest undertaking is the Hulhumale land reclamation project. It is meant to ease overcrowding in Male. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- Boxl. THE 2001 DEVALUATIONAND~NFLATION Despite a very large import share in the consumer basket, the nine percent devaluation in July 200 1 has had a minimal impact on prices. Inflation was well contained at 3 percent in 200 1, and has averaged 2 percent in 2002 (through September). The effect of the exchange rate adjustment built gradually and peaked in January 2002 (Chart). l/ Inflation (excluding volatile fish prices) has fallen since and is near pre-devaluation levels. Three factors appear to explain the relative absence of pass-through:- IO 8 Falling international commodity prices; l Weakening domestic demand; and 0 l Price-smoothing by the State Trading -5 Organization (STO).With a market share at 80 percent, ST0 has a virtual -10 monopoly in the provision of staple -IS goods (including rice, flour and sugar) and it operates with the social mandate -20 I of providing them throughout the atolls at stable prices. ST0 is also the major $ $+*p \$ @+ J ,%p +,9$ ,p importer of petroleum products, whose retail prices show less volatility than international prices. Notwithstanding growing competition in import trade, ST0 remains a highly profitable state-enterprise, contributing to the budget some 20 percent of income from state enterprises, yearly. Looking ahead, inflation may pick up, as international commodity prices are rising once Igain. In addition, the recent rapid credit expansion could feed into inflation, although any demand pressures are more likely to be felt in international reserves. I/ The index has been rebased to zero in the month of the devaluation (July 200 l), so that the chart’s scale shows the percentage change in prices relative to that month.

Recent changes in the real effective exchange rate have reversed Real Effective Exchange Rates an earlier loss of competitiveness vis-Lvis 180 ~~~ IS” comparable tourist destinations (Text Chart). In addition, increased specialization in the processing of yellow-fin tuna is boosting the share of domestic fisheries in the international fish market. A further indication of the broadly appropriate exchange rate level stems from the reported disappearance of the parallel market that had emerged in the run-up to the devaluation. 8. Fiscal deficits have continued to widen on the back of strong expenditure growth. With slowing activity and falling tourism tax yields, the deficit worsened in 2001 for the fourth year in a row (Figure 4, Table 3). The budgetary imbalance is expected to widen again in 2002 to about 6 percent of GDP. Sustained growth in the wage bill and greater reliance on non-concessional borrowing have kept expenditures on an u ward trend, while revenues have been held back by the lower imports and tourist arrivals. 8 9. Monetary developments have been characterized for some time by central bank financing of the fiscal imbalances.7 Budgetary _~ shortfalls continue to be filled by overdrafts from the MMA, in the face of dwindling foreign resources (Text Chart). The recent lifting of credit ceilings has released a long-standing liquidity overhang. Credit to the private sector has surged by 23 percent this year, while broad money grew at a more moderate 13 percent through September (Table 4). Until recently, this increase in credit has been financed by a decline Grants and OffKal Lending Disbursements (share of total govemment expenditwe) in the banking system’s NFA position. 0 45 0 40 0 35 0 30 0 25 ” 20 0 15 ” 1” 0 “5 0 “0 6 Import duties and tourism taxes represented over 90 percent of tax revenues in 2001, or about 40 percent of current revenues. 7 At the time of the dismantlement of credit ceilings in mid-200 1, outstanding credit from the MMA was nearly 20 percent of GDP or one-third of total public debt.

The banking sector is challenged by greater competition and slowing growth.8 With a captive market and little competition, - Maldivian banks have historically been quite profitable, notwithstanding high funding costs implied by a 35 percent reserve requirement on deposits. The situation is changing with the entry of new financial institutions. Once-rigid lending rates have shown first signs of downward flexibility. Furthermore, in the weaker economic environment, nonperforming loans (NPLs) have risen, especially at the largest bank (Text Chart).g I -- Non-Performing Loans (in percent of total loans) ,Ri ~~ 16 1 11. Structural reform is gathering momentum on some fronts. Fish exports have been opened to private operators, and the authorities are considering plans for restructuring the loss-making Maldives Industrial Fisheries Company (MIFCO). Shares of the State Trading Organization (STO) have finally been sold to the public, supporting other efforts to foster a fledgling capital market. Key economic laws are in the works, notably a Public Finance Act and revised Banking and MMA Acts. In addition, initial steps have been taken to overhaul the operational framework of the MMA, including the lifting of bank-by-bank credit ceilings, the abolition of the cap on the interest rate spread, and the establishment of a facility for emergency liquidity assistance. 12. The near-term outlook is for a modest pick up of activity, but prospects remain hostage to external vulnerabilities (Table 5). The ongoing recovery in tourism, along with greater dynamism in fisheries, should help raise growth to some 3 percent in 2003. Yet, hesitations in the global recovery, geopolitical uncertainties, and the impact on Maldivian tourism of the October 2002 Bali bombings, may undermine performance.” III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS The discussion focused on the policy requirements to bring the Maldives back to a stronger and sustainable growth path and the need to strengthen the policy framework to regain room for maneuver over the medium term. 8 The banking system comprises three state-owned foreign banks (from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka), a local state-owned bank (Bank of Maldives), and a new entrant (HSBC). A leasing company partly owned by the IFC also started operation in 2002. ’ Recent lending has reportedly provided bridge financing to distressed enterprises burdened by the high interest rates and short maturity of outstanding obligations. lo Three-fourths of visitors to the Maldives come from Europe.

Macroeconomic Policies Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy 13. There was agreement that the pegged exchange rate should continue to be the cornerstone of the macroeconomic framework. The Maldives’ high degree of openness and small size, its currency composition of trade and limited integration in world capital markets, as well as institutional shortcomings, all argue for the appropriateness of maintaining the U.S. dollar peg. The authorities noted that the 2001 devaluation has been effective in eliminating the parallel market and shoring up international competitiveness. With pressures on reserves gone, outright rationing of foreign exchange has ended. The mission found no evidence of any restriction subject to approval under Article VIII, but cautioned against even the use of moral suasion to constrain the demand for dollars, a practice that by some accounts had not fully disappeared. There was agreement that, notwithstanding the evolving trade linkages, shifting the peg to a Euro/dollar basket was at best premature, given a limited institutional capacity and the need to preserve a simple and transparent nominal anchor. 14. The authorities were pleased with the recent build up in reserves but thought that import cover should be higher still. A reserve target of 5 months of imports is in their view warranted by the Maldives’ intrinsic vulnerability to external shocks and its liberal exchange rate regime. The mission agreed on the strategy of reconstituting a buffer of foreign exchange-and budgetary-resources over the medium term, but thought that current policies are incompatible with its fulfillment. 15. There was agreement that monetary policy should be geared toward supporting the fixed exchange rate regime. The authorities noted that budgetary recourse to central bank financing in 2002 had been the result of unforeseen revenue shortfalls. They also pointed out that steps away from direct monetary controls had been taken, and that the use of central bank’s certificate of deposits to absorb liquidity had proved helpful. The mission acknowledged the advances, but expressed concern about the continued monetization of fiscal deficits. In its view, without more far-reaching institutional changes-such as closing the government’s overdraft facility at the MMA (the Ways and Means account), the introduction of treasury bills, and the establishment of a legal basis for central bank independence-fiscal pressures would continue to constrain the ability of the MMA to focus on policies supporting the peg. Fiscal Policy 16. The authorities are aware that the fiscal stance is putting stress on the system. The 2003 budget process had just started at the time of the mission with the Ministry of Finance issuing guidelines for line ministries to cut expenditure. However, preliminary budget requests from spending agencies were coming in well above 2002 levels, suggesting difficulties in implementing meaningful consolidation next year. The mission argued that the risks from a continuation of an expansionary fiscal policy are compounded by the likelihood Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- of further deficit monetization as in the past. It urged the authorities to make an upfront fiscal adjustment in the 2003 budget, and to speed up reforms to curb fiscal dominance. In its view, a deficit of about 3% percent of GDP (implying an adjustment of about 1% percent of GDP) would be achievable and mark a credible start of fiscal adjustment.” The authorities agreed with the mission’s call for consolidation, but were not yet ready to formulate specific measures at the early stage of the budgetary process. They reiterated, nonetheless, their intention to avoid recourse to central bank financing through expenditure containment and more efficient use of the available concessional funds. 17. The authorities agreed that there was scope to widen the tax base and reassess tax rates, but only over the medium term. In their assessment, the current environment is not propitious for tax increases. The mission countered that the seriousness of the fiscal imbalance calls for immediate measures. The bed tax, last adjusted in 1988, could be increased to US$8 to restore its real value, with minimal impact on tourist arrivals.12 The rental on public land use by state enterprises could also be raised from its present (almost symbolic) rate of one rufiyaa per square foot. Together, these measures could yield revenues on the order of l-l % percent of GDP. In line with previous advice, the mission also suggested that the tax base should be widened over time through the introduction of property and business taxes. The authorities did not disagree, but prefer to defer action until a (AsDB- sponsored) study on tax reform is completed and administrative capacity improves. There was agreement that over the longer term revenues could be made less susceptible to external developments with a shift from import duties to a general sales tax. 18. The authorities saw more room for adjustment on the expenditure side of the budget. In their view, a more effective mechanism of expenditure control would become operational soon with a revamped public accounting system. Growth in current spending could be reined in by limiting salary increases and the planned overhaul of social security. Capital spending could also be better prioritized. The mission agreed on the need to take measures on the expenditure side and reminded the authorities of the specific steps to rationalize public spending identified in the recent World Bank Public Expenditure Review. In particular, there is scope for trimming back general administration expenses including by containing the wage bill, while preserving spending on education and healthcare; capital spending could be rationalized in the context of a multi-year plan, with due consideration of the recurring expenditure implications of public projects; and civil service reform should l1 Of the suggested decline in the deficit from 6.0 percent of GDP to 3.8 percent of GDP, around ‘/z percent of GDP is accounted for by a projected reduction in capital spending due to the completion of a large public project. I2 The bed tax is a specific tax of US$6. Its transformation into an ad valorem tax seems premature because of weaknesses in tax administration and the fact that the price of vacations in the Maldives is determined by tour operators overseas and thus is not easily monitored by the authorities. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- remain on the agenda. More broadly, the mission stressed that expenditure adjustments should complement, rather than substitute for, tax measures in prospective budgets. 19. Budgetary developments are also being shaped by the continued decline of concessional lending and grants. Private financing is slowly taking the place of donor assistance. Access to concessional funds may diminish further with the possible graduation of the Maldives from the United Nations’ LDC status (Box 2). The mission noted that increased reliance on commercial borrowing raises the issue of debt sustainability in the longer run, although the large share of concessional loans keeps the debt service ratio low in the medium term. l3 The authorities agreed on caution in debt management, but also underscored the unmet development needs that must continue to receive a high priority in policy design. 20. The authorities stressed the importance of continued support from donors to reduce poverty. l4 In their view, graduation of the Maldives from the United Nations’ LDC status would be damaging. Preferential market access to the European Union is also slated to expire in 2005. Although the economic growth over the last decades had improved several social indicators, the authorities argued that poverty remains widespread and the vulnerabilities arising from the Maldives’ limited resource base justify continued financial and technical assistance from the donor community. B. Medium-Term Outlook 21. Without a policy reorientation reserves are likely to be reduced to a minimum over the medium term. Under the mission’s current-policies scenario (Table 6), fiscal deficits remain large until the deteriorating reserve position forces policy action in 2005. To safeguard external viability, import-intensive public projects take the brunt of adjustment, depressing activity. In the absence of reforms, slow growth in fish exports and tourism receipts, as well as debt service, hamper a build-up of reserves. By the end of the projection period, significant fiscal consolidation and some recovery in reserves have taken place, but in l3 The Maldives’ external debt to GDP ratio is about 42 percent (80 percent of which is public sector debt), but most borrowing has been on concessional terms. Debt service amounts to about 5l% percent of exports of goods and services. l4 The World Bank estimates that poverty incidence is as high as 50 percent in the outer atolls.

THE MALDIVES’ LDC STATUS The Maldives’ LDC status will be reviewed by the United Nations’ Committee on Development Policy (CDP) in 2003. Graduation would imply a loss of preferential treatment in trade and some access to concessional borrowing. The Maldives is currently eligible for IDA funds on a “small island” exception. The CDP uses three quantitative measures to determine eligibility for LDC status: the augmented physical quality of life index (APQLI); GDP per capita; and an economic vulnerability index (EVI). When a country is close to the threshold level for any of these measures, a more comprehensive study is undertaken to decide on graduation. In the 2000 review (covering developments through 1997), the Maldives was above the graduation threshold for GDP per capita and the APQLI, while the EVI was just below it (Box Chart). With further improvements in social indicators, the case for graduation appears to be strong. However, the Maldivian authorities stress that the graduation criteria do not take into account the country’s fundamental vulnerability (including to ecological developments) and its continued need for poverty alleviation. Moreover, measurement issues make, in their view, some of the UN indicators problematic. .

In addition, a protracted period of fiscal profligacy brings about an undesirable change in the output mix, with severe crowding-out of the private sector. l5 The authorities broadly agree with this analysis. 22. Under a reform scenario, adjustment would safeguard growth prospects (Table 7). Fiscal consolidation is started in 2003, along with a strong implementation of structural and legal reforms and a speedier execution of projects with concessional financing. Tax measures are undertaken upfront, including raising the bed tax and the land rent for state-owned enterprises.16 Current expenditure developments reflect in part slower wage growth in 2003 than under current policies. Reforms pave the way for a gradual acceleration of growth on the back of greater private sector participation and improved access to credit. Though the adjustment in the current account deficit is broadly similar in the two scenarios, the level of reserves is much more comfortable in the reform scenario, and debt service is less of a burden. More importantly, prospects for sustained growth over the longer term are greatly enhanced by policies that do not delay adjustment. Such policies are consistent with the medium-term objectives laid out in the recent Sixth National Development Plan. C. Financial Sector Issues 23. The authorities thought that ongoing financial liberalization was paving the way for greater private sector participation in the economy. In their view, lack of competition among banks has long stifled access to credit and the development of private enterprises.17 They hoped that the recent entry of a internationally-reputable bank and the establishment of a leasing company would improve the terms and availability of financing, especially for small firms. The mission welcomed these steps, but also pointed to other structural weaknesses that undermined effective bank intermediation, including the lack of an interbank market and the high reserve requirements. Both issues should be addressed in the context of a gradual strategy to enhance monetary operations. 24. Views differed as to the significance of emerging NPLs. The authorities conceded that monitoring was warranted but stressed that banks were overall well capitalized and that l5 The Maldives’ garment industry is expected to be dismantled as preferential access to industrial markets ceases. Although garment exports account for almost half of merchandise exports, domestic content in value added is minimal, and the authorities do not envisage any significant macroeconomic impact from the industry’s demise. l6 The tax revenue to GDP ratio is projected to fall over the medium term because the yield from trade taxes is constrained by a relatively low income elasticity of import demand and the decline in oil prices assumed in the current WEO. In addition, the fact that the bed tax is a specific tax limits its buoyancy. l7 Difficulty in obtaining credit has been singled out as a limiting factor for the expansion of small operators in fisheries. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- the deterioration of their balance sheets reflected temporary developments affecting a handful of borrowers. l8 The mission cautioned against complacency: the current level of NPLs at a key bank is on the order of 4 percent of GDP and its deposits amount to about 20 percent of GDP. As a result, significant fiscal costs might arise from a further impairment of that bank’s assets. Thus, the mission stressed the need to strengthen supervision, and develop a strategy to deal with potential systemic issues. Reviewing the regulatory framework for loan classification and provisioning, and strengthening on-site supervision should be immediate priorities. D. Structural Policies and Other Issues 25. There has been some progress on privatization of state enterprises. The authorities noted, however, that the public offering of 10 percent of the shares in ST0 had been only partially subscribed, owing to an inadequate information campaign and the still underdeveloped capital market. Although no deadline had been set for re-offering the unsold shares, steps to strengthen the trading infrastructure are underway, including the enactment of a Securities Law and a possible role for the Provident Fund (which manages the voluntary pension contributions of government employees). The long-awaited restructuring of MIFCO is also in the offing, with a final plan ready for cabinet approval. The mission urged the authorities to step up divestment of activities that could be undertaken by the private sector- and to increase pressure on state enterprises to operate on a commercial basis by strengthening governance and accountability. 26. There are no immediate plans for rationalizing the tariff structure.” In light of the Maldives’ limited production base, the authorities continue to view tariffs as a key revenue source rather than as an instrument of protection. Pending broader tax reforms, changes in the tariff structure should thus avoid burdening the budget. The mission countered that the current trade regime is nonetheless a source of distortions and there is scope for improvement. Tariffcation of existing quotas (on some staples) and elimination of widespread exemptions should be considered a first order of business. A reassessment of current arrangements is planned in the context of the upcoming WTO trade policy review. 27. Legal reform has been slow, but the newly instituted Law Commission could speed up the legislative process. Several draft laws are under consideration, but limited I8 The limit on credit to a single borrower is currently set to 15 percent of a bank’s unimpaired capital and reserves. l9 The Maldives has rating of 7 in the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness which ranges from “1” (most open) to “10” (most restrictive). Its tariff structure consists of 10 rates ranging from zero to 200 percent, with an average of about 23 percent and a standard deviation of 25 percent. The difference between the simple average across tariff lines (46 percent) and the effective tariff rate (around 14 percent) points to a complex system of exemptions.

The mission stressed the need to press ahead with the legal reforms needed to create a business-friendly environment and encourage foreign investment. Passage of the Securities Act and the Land Act have been steps in the right direction but other important economic laws-notably the MMA Act (which will sanction central bank independence) and Public Finance Act (which will contain provisions for issuing government paper)-still await adoption. 28. The authorities thought that the Maldives was in line with international guidelines to combat money-laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Fund questionnaire on this topic was still being compiled at the time of the mission, and discussions had to be deferred. 29. Notwithstanding some improvements, the statistical base remains weak. Surveillance and policy design continue to be hampered by gaps and inconsistencies in economic data, which the authorities are trying to address with the assistance of the AsDB and other bilateral donors. In particular, national accounts data are available only at an annual frequency and are often subject to large revisions; private capital flows are roughly estimated in the balance of payments; and data on private external debt are very limited. An additional area that should receive special attention is collection and analysis of data which would help the MMA better gauge developments in the foreign exchange market. 30. The authorities are not ready to accept the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. In response to the mission’s encouragement, they noted that the issue would be considered in the near future. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 31. After a long period of commendable performance, growth has recently been undermined by policy slippages, temporary shocks, and structural weaknesses. There is a need to refocus macroeconomic and structural policies to contain outstanding imbalances and buttress prospects over the medium term. In light of the intrinsic exposure of the Maldives to external developments, the overarching strategy should aim at restoring foreign currency reserves and room for fiscal maneuver as a shield against unforeseen contingencies, while pursuing structural reforms to broaden the production and export base and heighten the resilience of the supply side. Elements of this strategy are implicit in the latest National Development Plan but still await decisive implementation. 32. The pegged exchange rate should continue to be the cornerstone of the macroeconomic framework. The fixed exchange rate regime is justified by the Maldives’ openness and small size, its limited integration in world capital markets, as well as its constrained institutional capacity and flexible labor market. The current level of the exchange rate appears consistent with a favorable outlook for the competitiveness of the tourism and fisheries sectors in the medium term. The credibility of the arrangement would be threatened by any constraints on access to foreign exchange and needs to be safeguarded by an Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- appropriate policy mix. Transparency as well as institutional considerations argue against a shift from a peg to the U.S. dollar to a basket of currencies any time soon. 33. Monetary management must be geared to supporting the peg. Monetization of budgetary deficits undermines the fixed exchange rate and sanctions fiscal profligacy. Closure of the overdraft facility for government access to central bank funds (the Ways and Means Account) should be of the highest priority. More broadly, early enactment of the revised MMA Act is key to establishing operational autonomy for monetary policy. In time, an overhaul of the MMA’s governance structure to secure full central bank independence would serve the Maldives best. 34. Recent steps away from reliance on direct instruments of monetary control are in the right direction and should continue. There is scope for better adapting to market conditions the terms of the central bank paper currently used to absorb liquidity, in particular by offering shorter maturities or more attractive interest rates. Over time, a gradual reduction of high reserve requirements could be considered to curb banks’ funding costs, but only once effective liquidity management is in place. 35. The present stance of fiscal policy jeopardizes external viability. Fiscal discipline needs to be restored quickly and the 2003 budget should mark the start of credible consolidation. An increase to more realistic levels in the tourism bed tax and in land rent for state-owned enterprises would provide a helpful boost to revenues. On the expenditure side of the budget, there is ample scope for containing expenditures on general administration and the wage bill, and prioritizing capital spending. The authorities are correct in planning no recourse to central bank funds for deficit financing, and should not tolerate-as they have in the past-slippages on this front. 36. Sound public finances also require further institutional and administrative reforms. There is a need to strengthen mechanisms of expenditure controls and introduce government securities to tap domestic savings for deficit financing. The ongoing work to overhaul the public accounting system and an early passage of the Public Finance Act should help address both issues. The system of allowances for public sector employees should be reviewed in the context of social security and civil service reform. Capital spending should be smoothed in a multi-year public investment program, with due consideration for the recurring expenditure implications of public projects. It will be prudent to limit reliance on commercial funds to finance public investments, lest public debt sustainability becomes an issue in the longer term. Finally, revenues could be made less susceptible to external shocks with the introduction of a property tax and a business profit tax and, in time, by shifting from import duties to a general sales tax. 37. Strengthening the Maldives’ resilience to shocks requires not only prudent macroeconomic management but also continuing structural reforms to enhance the role of the private sector and foster non-traditional exports. Privatization of state enterprises involved in activities that could be undertaken by the private sector should continue, as Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- appropriate. To that end, reforms to strengthen the accountability and operational efficiency of state enterprises, particularly MIFCO, should not be delayed. 38. The authorities are to be commended for promoting greater liberalization and competition in the banking sector. Their policies should, however, go hand-in-hand with strengthened supervision and a review of the MMA’s preparedness in dealing with any potential systemic concerns. In particular, it is important to reassess urgently the adequacy of current regulation on loans classification and provisioning. Finally, the unfinished legal reform agenda needs to be pursued aggressively by the newly established Law Commission, with a view to establish rapidly an enabling legal environment that supports business formation and foreign investment. 39. While the Maldives has a commendably liberal exchange regime, its trade policies remain moderately restrictive. The current tariff structure suggests distortions and an opaque system of exemptions. The upcoming WTO trade policy review offers a welcome opportunity to rationalize existing arrangements and push forward trade liberalization. 40. Some progress notwithstanding, surveillance and policy design continue to be hampered by gaps and inconsistencies in economic data. The authorities are to be commended for their efforts to build statistical capacity with the help of donor assistance. An area that should receive special attention is collection and analysis of data which would help the MMA better gauge developments in the foreign exchange market. 41. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Maldives take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange Arrangements From March 1, 1982 to June 30, 1985, the Maldivian rufiyaa was pegged to the U.S. dollar. Beginning in July 1985, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was linked to a trade-weighted basket of currencies, but the exchange rate vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar remained relatively stable until February 1987. On March 1, 1987, the rufiyaa was devalued by 29 percent vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. From 1987 to 1994, the exchange rate of the ruliyaa was adjusted periodically. Since October 1994, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa remained unchanged at Rf 11.77 per U.S. dollar, until July 25, 200 1, when the rufiyaa was devalued to Rf. 12.8 per U.S. dollar. Maldives continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under the provisions of Article XIV, but no longer maintains restrictions under Article XIV. Under these circumstances, any exchange rate restrictions that arise are subject to approval under Article VIII. Maldives’ Post Office Exchange Counter (which existed until July 2000) did not by itself give rise to an exchange rate restriction. However, a restriction arises from time to time (as found in 1994-95) in the context of a general foreign exchange shortage and undue delays in the making of current international payments. VIII.

The current IDA portfolio has one project, Third Education and Training, which is building upon the successes of the First and Second education projects. IDA is also providing technical assistance ($245,000-IDF) to the Government to develop an appropriate legal/regulatory framework for efficient land and housing markets in Maldives. In the current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) dated November 17, 2000, the Bank outlines its strategic choice to increase the frequency and scope of non-lending activities, and gradually shift from sector-specific project lending to a programmatic approach to lending. The objective of this strategy is to reduce poverty and the regional disparities in access to social and infrastructure services in the Maldives.

However, problems with the compilation and reporting of basic economic data remain, especially with respect to balance of payments statistics. The main official statistical publication is the Statistical Yearbook of Maldives for which the latest version refers to 2002. APD also receives, albeit with a lag, the Quarterly Economic Bulletin and the Annual Report of the Maldives Monetary Authority. I. Real Sector Substantial progress has been made regarding national accounts. The AsDB is assisting the authorities in setting up a framework for compiling more comprehensive national accounts. Results from this work are beginning to be seen, with rebased figures on the production side, and preliminary figures on the expenditure side. The CPI based on the 1993 income and expenditure survey and incorporating improved data collection procedures was developed with STA assistance-and has been compiled since June 1995. A STA consumer price statistics mission of August 1996 recommended that the authorities develop additional price indices for a more comprehensive analysis of inflation. II. Fiscal Sector In 1996, the authorities resumed regular reporting of data for publication in the GFS Yearbook and the latest published data refer to 2000. III. Monetary sector In 200 1 the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) began reporting monetary data on a monthly basis. However, there are inconsistencies between monetary and fiscal data regarding the financing of the fiscal deficit. Reconciliation involves issues of timing and coverage. IV. External Sector Following the 1994 STA mission, a number of measures were taken to improve data coverage and quality for the balance of payments. However, problems of coverage remain. Travel receipts are still estimated on the basis of a small-sample inquiry of resorts/hotels to determine daily average expenditure by tourists. Estimates of profit remittances and reinvested earnings in the tourism sector are still unsatisfactory. Information on private capital flows is incomplete. Official reserves are reported monthly with a (variable) two week lag. Predetermined drains on foreign currency assets (mainly debt service payments) are known and reported at the time of the annual missions, while contingent drains on foreign currency assets have not been identified.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with Maldives On January [6], 2003, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2002 Article IV consultation with Maldives.’ Background The Maldivian economy has prospered over the past decade with the rapid expansion of tourism and the modernization of the fisheries sector. During the 1990s annual GDP growth averaged around 8%, raising per capita income to about US$2,200 in 2000. Though poverty incidence in the outer atolls remains high, social indicators have improved steadily. Economic growth slowed, however, in recent years, and was further dampened by the tourism slowdown beginning in 2001 -Growth is expected at around 2’/4% for 2002, implying no per capita income gains for the first time in over twenty years. Despite the July 2001 devaluation of the rufiyaa, inflation has been kept in check. International competitiveness of resorts and fisheries does not seem to be at issue. After a loss of international reserves in 2001, the balance of payments has improved. Reserves recovered to about 3 months of imports by [September] 2002. The external current account deficit is expected to remain wide at 8.9% of GDP for the year, but capital inflows, both public and private, have provided the necessary financing. External debt, most of which is on concessional terms, has risen to 42% of GDP in 2002, and debt service has remained about Z/2% of exports of goods and nonfactor services. I Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the January 6, 2003 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

It is expected to reach 6% of GDP in 2002, reflecting strong capital expenditures, increasingly financed externally on commercial terms. Current spending has also continued to grow, mainly in the areas of general administration and social services. Falling yields in tourism-related taxes have further weakened the budgetary outturn. Monetary developments in 2002 have been characterized by continued central bank financing of budgetary imbalances. Effective liquidity management remains an issue, while the banking system is being challenged by slowing growth, removal of credit ceilings, and stronger competition. Structural reforms are gaining momentum. Important economic laws are in the works and inroads are being made toward the privatization of key state-owned enterprises.
