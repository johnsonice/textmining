Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Seychelles were held in Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles during October 30-November 13, 1995. The Seychelles representatives included the Honorable J. Michel (Minister of Finance and Communications), Mr. N. Weber (Governor of the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) and Principal Secretary, Ministry of Finance), Mr. F. Chang Leng (General Manager at the CBS), and other senior government officials concerned with economic and financial matters. The staff representatives (all AFR) were Messrs. Cyril Enweze (head), E. Ibrahim, G. El-Masry, and K. Pedersen, and Ms. V. Pinto (assistant). Seychelles is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. In con- cluding the last Article IV consultation, Executive Directors expressed concern about the sharp deterioration in the fiscal position, resulting in a weakening of the external accounts, a loss of international reserves, and the continuing accumulation of external arrears. They stressed the urgent need for swift action to improve the budgetary position, and urged the authorities to accelerate their reform efforts in liberalizing and diversifying the economy. Seychelles has a mixed record with respect to the quality and timeli- ness of provision of economic and financial statistics (Appendix I). While some &ta-- on external reserves, monetary developments, and prices--have been provided to the Fund on a regular basis, other data--particularly national accounts, fiscal, and balance of payments statistics--have been provided only in the context of the regular Article IV consultation discus- sions. The absence of regular data reporting has hampered effective sur- veillance over Seychelles' economic policies. In addition to publishing some economic and financial data on Seychelles themselves, the authorities do not object to the regular publication of such data by the Fund. Seychelles accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in January 1978. The country has had no recourse to Fund resources but has received significant Fund technical assistance, particularly in the areas of central banking and fiscal matters.

II. Recent Economic DeveloDments Seychelles' economic performance has deteriorated markedly in recent years. Preliminary estimates indicate that economic growth was negative in 1994 and 1995 (Table l), owing largely to a drop in tourism receipts, as well as the poor performance of the agricultural sector, including fisheries. lJ Unemployment is high, at some 9 percent of the labor force. 2J The annual rate of inflation (as measured by the retail price index) was about 1.8 percent in 1994, and is estimated to be even lower in 1995. 3J The budget deficit (excluding grants) is estimated at an average of 5 percent of GDP in 1994 and 1995 (Table 2); however, exclusive of the proceeds from the sale of assets, the budget deficit is,estimated at an average of 8.6 percent of GDP in both years. Expansion in net bank credit to the Government remains largely responsible for the growth in broad money of about 17 percent in 1994 and an estimated 14 percent in 1995 (Table 3). Pressures on the external sector have intensified since 1994, as evidenced by the continued accumulation of external commercial payments arrears 4J (estimated at approximately SDR 35.7 million at end-1995, or about 19 percent of exports of goods and services); the tightening of the foreign exchange surrender requirement (from 15 percent to 19 percent in August 1995); the reintroduction of import licensing in September 1995; a growing parallel market for foreign exchange (where the rupee has reportedly been trading at a widened discount of 20-25 percent); and a continuing decline in gross official reserves, which reached 7.5 weeks of imports at end-1995. The nominal effective exchange rate has appreciated markedly over the past five years (Chart 1). 5/ Over the same period, the real effec- tive exchange rate has fluctuated without any persistent upward or downward trend. 6J The external debt service burden remains low, about 10 percent of exports of goods and services (Table 4). JJ The economy is highly dependent on tourism (18 percent of GDP) and to a lesser extent on maritime activities (4 percent of GDP). u This reflects partly a decreasing role of the public sector in economic activity and unemployment. 2/ The retail price index, which includes administratively controlled prices (mostly on imported items), is not broadly representative because it covers only low-income families. u The average waiting time in the payments pipeline reached some 48 weeks as of October/November 1995. I/ This appreciation reflects, in part, the differences between the composition of the SDR basket, to which the rupee is pegged, and the currencies used to calculate Seychelles' effective exchange rate index. u However, the inclusion of administratively controlled prices in the domestic price index tends to underestimate the relative price pressures in Seychelles.

ReDort on the Discussions The consultation discussions took place against the background of declining trends in inflows of foreign grants and loans, a rising level of commercial payments arrears, and increasing distortions in the allocation of resources resulting from various administrative controls and a growing parallel market for foreign exchange. Meanwhile, expectations of a devalua- tion of the rupee were widespread in Seychelles, particularly in commercial and banking circles. Accordingly, the discussions centered on an appro- priate policy package-- including a credible one-step exchange rate adjust- ment underpinned by more restrained fiscal, monetary, and wage policies, and further external sector liberalization --to ease the pressures on the balance of payments, as well as to remove the existing relative price distortions. 1. Domestic financial policies The mission noted that in each of the two years ended 1995, the overall budget deficit (excluding grants) had remained large; moreover, since the deficits in those years had been financed entirely by bank borrowing, they were the primary source of monetary expansion. Under the recently announced 1996 budget and with a continuation of present trends in revenue and expen- diture, the overall budget deficit would widen over the medium term, re- sulting in higher levels of domestic bank financing and undermining macro- economic and external stability. Given the high level of revenue in terms of GDP and the limited room for maneuver on the revenue side, fiscal adjust- ment must focus primarily on the expenditure side, including measures to reduce subsidies to parastatals, which together receive the equivalent of more than 4 percent of GDP in various forms of assistance from the budget. While concurring with the need to implement strong fiscal policies, the Seychelles representatives were concerned that the private sector was not expanding rapidly enough to absorb the potential layoffs that substantial fiscal retrenchment would entail. With regard to the fiscal outcome for 1994, the Seychelles represen- tatives stated that, although fiscal measures had been put in place only around midyear, there had been a large reduction in the overall deficit (before grants) --by 4.6 percentage points of GDP--to 5.1 percent of GDP. They noted that in 1995, notwithstanding a package of tax cuts to stimulate private sector activity, the overall budget deficit had been reduced further to 4.9 percent of GDP. Despite an increase of about 9 percent in nontax revenues, total revenues fell by about 8 percent in 1995 on account of a decline of about 14 percent in tax revenues, following the implementation of various tax cuts. The latter included reductions in the rates of social security contributions (from 85 percent to 45 percent of employees' gross monthly incomes) and in the effective rate of taxation of imported goods. In addition, depreciation allowances under the business tax were made more generous, while additional tax concessions were introduced under the Invest- ment Promotion Act of 1994, to boost private sector activity. However, total expenditure and net lending were reduced by about 8 percent, as current and capital expenditures were reduced by about 5 percent and 23 percent, respectively. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- Regarding the 1996 budget, the Seychelles representatives stated that its broad objectives were to create an environment conducive to private (domestic and foreign) investment and to reduce the cost of living further. Accordingly, the budgetary measures include a combination of reductions in taxes and traders' margins for several imported foodstuffs, an average reduction of 25 percent in electricity tariffs, as well as decreases ranging from 40-52 percent in telephone tariffs. While these budgetary measures were not consistent with the staff's recommendations for increases in fees and user charges, the Seychelles representatives explained that they com- plemented the provisions of the Economic Development Act of November 1995, which envisages a number of incentives and concessions for qualified inves- tors in approved projects. The incentives, concessions, and qualifying projects would be determined, on an ad hoc basis, by members of an Economic Development Board set up under the Act; the Seychelles authorities concurred that this approach would call for transparency and integrity in the imple- mentation of the provisions of the Act, in order not to compromise the country's reputation. In this context, they did not share the staff's views on the need to abolish the generous tax concessions and incentives embodied in legislation such as the Investment Promotion Act of 1994. u On the contrary, they expected that the resulting investment in Seychelles would lead to a substantial increase in fees and licenses,. Consequently, despite a budgeted decline of some 5 percent in tax revenues, the 1996 budget envisions an increase in total revenues of about 22 percent over the estimated outturn for 1995, as nontax revenues (mostly fees and licenses) are optimistically budgeted at almost double the estimated 1995 outturn. On the expenditure side, the Seychelles representatives stated that, after having declined in real terms in 1995, current expenditures were budgeted to increase in 1996 by about 7 percent, mostly on account of expenditures on the tourism and transport sectors; the defense budget, however, would be cut by 5 percent. In addition, they stated that capital expenditures were budgeted to increase by about 57 percent (mostly in the latter part of the year), largely because of the new land reclamation project for the prospective Seychelles International Trade Zone (see below), as well as the redevelopment of MahC International Airport. The staff reiterated its concerns that the 1996 budget envisaged an increase in expenditures on parastatals, and that it did not include any increases in fees or user charges. With regard to monetary developments, the staff indicated that, as in 1994 and 1995, net credit to government would provide the primary impetus to JJ In addition to those measures, other recommendations of the FAD Revenue Review Mission of 1995 included conversion of the trade tax into a value-added tax (around 1998). supplemented by a set of excises on selected goods; modification of the present business tax and the eventual introduc- tion (beginning from about 1997 or as soon as possible thereafter) of a flat rate company tax, as well as a personal income tax; and a halving of the current rate of contributions under the social security system, with the revenue used only to finance benefits paid under the social security system.

In this context, staff projections indicate that broad money growth would again reach some 14 percent, or the same rate of increase as in 1995, with net credit to government accounting for about 90 percent of this increase. In addition, since the authorities' last efforts in November 1992 to tighten monetary policy, no further tightening has been undertaken. The 1992 measures included an increase in the cash reserve requirement of the commercial banks from 10 percent to 20 percent, and the abolition of the ceiling on commercial banks' lending rates (see SM/94/256). However, given the already high level of the reserve require- ment and in light of the preponderant role of the fiscal deficit in monetary expansion, the staff and the Seychelles representatives were of the same view that further increases in reserve requirements were not called for. Meanwhile, however, since the reintroduction of the tender system for Treasury bills in August 1993, the staff expressed concern that the Seychelles authorities have continued to decide the cutoff level for bids from the commercial banks (thus determining the maximum interest rate at which the authorities are willing to issue Treasury bills), rather than allowing market determination of interest rates. Consequently, the average interest rate on Treasury bills declined from 13.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1994 to 12.15 percent at end-September 1995. To foster the longer term development of the financial sector, the 1996 budget has been accompanied by the passage of a number of legislative bills. These include the 1995 Securities Industry Act (establishing a small stock exchange in Seychelles); an Insurance (Amendment) Act, which provides for the conduct of offshore insurance and reinsurance business; and the Finan- cial Institutions (Amendment) Act, under which offshore banking activity would be licensed in Seychelles. In the meantime, the Seychelles represen- tatives confirmed their awareness of the implications of prospective developments in the financial sector for banking supervision. Accordingly, they were in the process of reviewing the relevant prudential regulations at the time of the mission's visit. 2. Production nolicies In recent years, higher tourist arrivals have not been reflected in corresponding increases in tourism receipts, and the fisheries sector has continued to perform poorly. While concurring with the mission on the need to strengthen the performance of these sectors, the Seychelles represen- tatives are also taking measures to develop what they perceive as a "third pillar" of the economy, namely, international trade and offshore business and financial (including banking) services. Recorded tourism receipts fell sharply in 1994 (even compared with historical trends), largely on account of a decline in officially recorded per diem tourist expenditures; tourist arrivals also fell by about 5.4 per- cent, to some 110,000 visitors in 1994. Although tourism arrivals are estimated to have increased by about 10 percent in 1995, officially recorded per capita tourism receipts have continued to decline, owing largely to the growing leakage of foreign exchange receipts into an increasingly active parallel market. Meanwhile, drawing partly on the results of the task force Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - that was set up in early 1994 to chart a long-range tourism policy for Seychelles, the authorities embarked in early 1995 on plans to further develop the tourism sector. To this end, a new five-year Tourism Plan was drawn up with a view to gradually increasing tourist arrivals from their present level to a maximum of 250,000 visitors per annum, mainly by tapping into the mid-income segment of the tourism market, while maintaining the current image of Seychelles as an upscale tourism destination. The new policy (which is still being worked out) should be launched in Berlin in March 1996. The national flag carrier--Air Seychelles--continues to experience financial difficulties, with operational losses also recorded in 1994 and 1995. In spite of this, and given the airline's pivotal role in the new tourism policy, the authorities are considering its request for a sizable injection of working capital from the Government (in addition to the SR 10 million that the Government loaned the airline in 1993, which has still not been repaid). In discussing the fishing sector, the Seychelles representatives stated that, while artisanal fishing had continued to experience difficulties in 1994 and 1995, a number of recent developments augured well for industrial fishing in the near to medium term. First, the privatization of stevedoring and shorehandling operations of Port Victoria, and the reduction in port taxes, have contributed to increased productivity and improved efficiency, as well as an increase in tuna transshipment through Seychelles; they expected that tuna transshipment activity will increase further over the medium term. Second, the U.S.-based Heinz Group has acquired a 60 percent stake in Conserveries de 1'Ocean Indien (COI), the tuna canning factory, which has now been renamed the Indian Ocean Tuna Limited (IOT). The Seychelles representatives expect an expansion (up to fourfold) in IOT's production within the next three years, with about 900 new jobs being created in the process. Third, some foreign assistance has been received from Japan for the improvement of industrial and semi-industrial fishing activities. The Seychelles representatives stated that a two-week workshop, financed by the European Union, which would bring together experts from around the world to discuss fishery surveillance in the Western Indian Ocean waters, was scheduled for January 1996; the conference was expected to raise awareness of the issue and put fisheries surveillance high on the agenda of the country's top policymakers. Overall, the performance of the agricultural sector, as measured by the purchases of the Seychelles Marketing Board (SMB) for fruits and vegetables, copra, and tea, remained poor in 1994 and 1995. u The liberalization of agricultural production activities had been completed (except for some meat production) with the private sector now wholly responsible for all agricul- tural production. Consequently, in the agricultural sector, the Government has now limited itself to a supportive role, facilitating rural development through the provision of infrastructure (such as roads, drainage, and irri- gation in various parts of the country), particularly in the context of the u There have been no changes in the marketing of agricultural products or in the operations of the SMB, as described in SM/93/226. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - Integrated Agricultural Development Project, with financial support (amount- ing to SR 41 million) from the African Development Bank. The Seychelles representatives stated that major new efforts are under way to develop Seychelles as an international trade, and an offshore business and financial, center. These efforts have culminated in the enact- ment of new legislation, including the International Business Companies Act of 1994, the International Trust Act of December 1994, and the Seychelles International Trade Zone (SITZ) Act of June 1995. In addition, two new investment agencies--the Industrial Development Advisory Services (IDEAS) (a subdivision of the Ministry of Finance), and Seychelles International Business Authority (SIBA) --were established in January 1995 and February 1995, respectively, to promote the new initiatives in the nascent "third pillar" of the economy. u As of early December 1995, some 310 companies had been registered under the International Business Companies Act (and several more applications were awaiting approval), and two trust companies had been registered under the International Trust Act. The International Trade Zone (slated to cover about 20 hectares of land), which will combine opportunities for transshipment, export processing, and offshore manufac- turing activities, is yet to become operational, but the relevant land areas have been designated and budgetary allocations earmarked in the 1996 budget, with a view to commencing development of the necessary infrastructure later in 1996, including the reclamation of land close to the international airport. Similarly, legislation providing for the licensing of offshore banking and insurance was passed with the 1996 budget. There have been no significant changes in overall employment trends since mid-1994. However, the Government's ongoing privatization program has led to some small shifts in the shares of employment in the public sector as compared with the private sector, as well as some redundancies, especially given the slow pace of the private sector in filling the slack resulting from public sector retrenchments. As of end-August 1995, there were some 3,153 registered unemployed persons, about 9 percent of the labor force, with a large part of the unemployed consisting of women and young persons. The Seychelles representatives stated that the Government had established a program under which the unskilled jobless were being given opportunities for skills development, and, in April 1995, had replaced the Full Employment Scheme with the Unemployment Relief Scheme, to provide temporary relief to the jobless. Meanwhile, a revised Employment Act, in force since April 1995, has introduced new flexibility for workers and employers to establish u The Seychelles representatives stated that several factors made Seychelles an attractive center for international trade and offshore business and financial operations. These include the deepest seaport in the region and an international airport (now being redeveloped) with efficient air cargo facilities, both currently serving major shipping companies and airlines, respectively, operating to key centers in Europe, Asia, and Africa, yet with significant unused capacity; a good telecommunications network; a literate bilingual work force, and political stability.

The PSIP has effectively replaced the previous National Development Plan, which was a broader list of investment projects desired by all the government ministries and departments. Under the PSIP, a list of 23 first-priority projects (totaling about SR 465 million) has been drawn up for the period 1995-97, prominent among which are projects for waste treatment, education, electricity, tourism, and the redevelopment of Mahe International Airport. The PSIP has also attempted to integrate and reconcile the priorities between the other plans, notably the Environmental Development Plan and the Human Resources Development Plan (see SM/94/256). Finally, reflecting the Government's policy of encouraging private sector participation in the development of the country, the PSIP also identifies a number of projects that are potential candidates for partial or total private funding. 3. External sector nolicies Seychelles' external accounts remained under pressure during 1994 and 1995, despite a drop in imports resulting from the negative growth of the economy during the period. The current account deficit (before official grants) remained large, averaging about 5 percent of GDP in both years, and the overall balance of payments deficit averaged about 2.6 percent of GDP. These deficits have been financed by the drawdown of reserves and the accumulation of commercial payments arrears: gross official reserves declined steadily to about 7.5 weeks imports in 1995, while external arrears have risen steadily to SDR 35.7 million. Present indications are that, in the absence of corrective measures, the external sector will remain under pressure in 1996. The Seychelles representatives stated that the weakness in the external accounts over the past two years was attributable to several factors. First, travel receipts had declined continuously since 1993; in this context, the Seychelles representatives acknowledged that a large part of the decline in tourism receipts reflected an increasing leakage of official foreign exchange receipts into the parallel market. In addition, net long- term capital inflows had declined substantially during the period on account of decreased foreign exchange inflows from the sale of assets and public loan drawings, at the same time that loan repayments had increased. Finally, the foreign exchange mobilization bonds, which were issued in March 1994 to attract foreign exchange balances held abroad (see SM/94/256), had proved unsuccessful: subscriptions to the scheme were disappointingly low, and the system was scrapped in the first quarter of 1995. lJ There have been no changes in the wage negotiation process, described in SM/94/256. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - Nevertheless, the authorities explained that they had been making a number of efforts in several areas in order to correct the situation. In this context, the pipeline system for foreign exchange requests introduced in April 1994 had been disaggregated into seven categories (but in the staff's view, made more complicated), according to the Government's deter- mination of the relative priority of each request. The increase in the surrender requirement for the commercial banks and the reintroduction of import licenses would be on a temporary basis, pending an appropriate fiscal adjustment, a process that the authorities considered to be getting under way. Meanwhile, they added that, in spite of pressures to do the opposite, they had continued to eschew resort to external borrowing for clearing the pipeline of arrears. Instead, they had used portions of the proceeds from the short-lived foreign exchange bond issue, as well as from the sale of assets in the hotel sector, to reduce commercial arrears. In reviewing exchange rate policy, the mission discussed with the Seychelles representatives a number of indirect and statistical indicators that pointed to a substantial overvaluation of the exchange rate of the rupee. In addition to pervasive expectations of an exchange rate devaluation in commercial and banking circles in Seychelles, a number of other factors were cited, including developments in the rupee rate in the unofficial parallel market (where some official entities are now also reportedly active, albeit without the authorities' approval, and where the rupee has reportedly been trading at a discount of 20-25 percent); the sustained appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate for the rupee; JJ the continuing leakage of foreign exchange receipts from offi- cial channels; and the differential of some 20 percent in tourism expen- diture reported in 1994 by the commercial banks as against survey-based tourism expenditure data estimated by the 'Seychelles representatives. On the basis of these indicators (which point to an over-valuation of 20-25 per- cent in the exchange rate of the rupee), the mission recommended an appro- priate one-step devaluation of the rupee, 2/ to be bolstered by restrained monetary, fiscal and wage policies. Actions along these lines would permit the gradual elimination of the commercial payments arrears within an 18- month period, in tandem with a buildup of reserves. While noting the mis- sion's views on these matters, the Seychelles representatives did not make any commitment on the suggested course of action, but reiterated their determination to find suitable solutions to the problems of the economy, including improvements emanating from tight fiscal and monetary policies. 1/ The real effective exchange rate index is distorted by the unrelia- bility of the administratively controlled price index. 2J The recommended approach would not involve a change of the rupee peg to the SDR basket, in order to focus on the critical importance of appropriate policies in dealing with the macroeconomic imbalances presently facing Seychelles. In addition, in the past, the rupee/SDR peg had served Seychelles well during periods when macroeconomic (particularly fiscal) policies had been prudent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - Medium-term fiscal and balance of payments projections indicate that, in the absence of appropriate corrective measures, the fiscal deficit will worsen in the medium term (Table 5), as will the current account of the balance of payments, on account of weaker exports and import growth (Table 6). This, together with projected slower increases in private long- term capital, will result in overall balance of payments deficits, leading to further depletion of reserves and/or a continued accumulation of external arrears, and further loss of private sector confidence. By contrast, an alternative policy scenario illustrates the benefits of the policy framework proposed by the staff. In the context of the proposed devaluation of the f=pee, the assumptions underlying the fiscal "policy" projections include: no nominal wage increase in 1996, and a gradual reduction of the wage bill, starting in 1997; a substantial reduction in, and eventual phaseout of, net lending, starting from 1996; and tight expenditure controls. Largely as a result of the revenue effects of the proposed exchange rate adjustment, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain stable at about 40 percent of GDP. By contrast, projected expenditure measures could reduce sharply the ratio of total expenditure and net lending to GDP during 1996-2000, alto- gether by about 10 percentage points of GDP. Consequently, in this scenario, after recording an approximate balance in 1996 (even without the sale of assets), the budget would generate a steadily increasing surplus, reaching about 4 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period (Table 7). With the exchange rate adjustment, and the accompanying fiscal con- solidation and other measures, the balance of payments is projected to strengthen beginning in 1996 L/ (Table 8), on account of three factors. First, exports are projected to grow strongly; in particular, a strong supply response is expected from agricultural exports and the artisanal fishing sector, along with an increase in Seychelles' share of the tuna market. Second, official tourism receipts are projected to recover with the elimination, through the exchange rate adjustment, of the differential between the official and parallel market exchange rates of the rupee, underpinned by appropriately tight demand management and structural poli- cies. Third, the measures proposed by the staff are expected to facilitate the return of confidence in the economy, increase private direct investment, notably, from 1997 onward, in connection with the various initiatives in the prospective offshore business and financial sector; in addition, private capital inflows are projected to increase substantially, reflecting the tuna privatization program, and further privatization in other sectors (including in the hotel sector). As a result, all external arrears are projected to be eliminated by 1997, and gross reserves are forecast to recover to the equivalent of about 9.5 weeks' imports by the end of the projection period. With regard to regional initiatives, the Seychelles representatives stated that they remained committed to participating in the Cross Border L/ Part of the projected improvement in the balance of payments in 1996 derives from a sharp compression in import demand, which would recover in 1997 largely on account of imports associated with the prospective SITZ.

They noted that membership in such initiatives would make Seychelles more attractive to foreign investors, with favorable implications for growth. Seychelles maintains exchange restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions on dividend transfers, the administrative allocation of foreign exchange, as well as those evidenced by the existence of certain commercial external payments arrears. The staff urged the authorities to put in place measures that would assist in eliminating the regulatory impediments that hinder an effective allocation of foreign exchange resources. IV. Staff Anoraisal Seychelles' overall economic performance has deteriorated markedly in recent years. Economic growth has been negative, and domestic demand pressures, fueled by an unsustainably large fiscal deficit, have continued to exacerbate external imbalances, and have led to an overvalued exchange rate, a continuing loss of reserves, the accumulation of commercial payments arrears, as well as increasing resort to various forms of administrative controls. The widening premium in the parallel market has led to wide- spread leakage of foreign exchange from official channels and has weakened the private sector's confidence in the economy. The authorities' response of tightening foreign exchange controls has introduced further distortions in the economy, and attempts to boost private sector confidence through tax cuts and exemptions are ineffectual and are putting additional strain on the weak fiscal position. The authorities need to implement urgently an economic policy package to address the deteriorating situation. Such a package should be centered around a credible one-step adjustment of the rupee peg, with the objective of eliminating current excess demand for foreign exchange. Credibility of the exchange rate peg over the medium term will require a substantial strengthening of the fiscal position. The authorities should take measures to reduce substantially the overall budget deficit and generate fiscal surpluses beginning in 1996. In the staff's view, an unsustainable fiscal policy stance lies at the root of Seychelles' current economic and financial problems: the level of the overall budget deficit has become very high, with a worrisome exclusive reliance on domestic bank borrowing. The 1996 budget, if implemented as announced, would continue these trends, jeopardizing the medium-term viability of the economy. To halt this development, the staff recommends that the authorities aim at the generation of a small budgetary surplus in 1996 (through a tight program of expenditure cuts, among other things), to be increased over the medium term and used to retire the Government's debt to the banking system. To this end, the authorities should begin the process of defraying the high cost of expenditure on basic social services through the introduction of user fees and charges. In this connection, the staff considers the reductions in certain basic utility rates in the 1996 budget a retrograde step, which should be rectified soon. Similarly, the announced increases in subventions to certain parastatals are taking place Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - at a time when major efforts should be under way to reduce substantially and phase out subsidies to parastatals and accelerate the privatization and/or the restructuring of public enterprises. Tighter fiscal policies must also be accompanied by more restrictive monetary and credit policies, with market forces being allowed to determine interest rates under the tender system for Treasury bills. Furthermore, in the staff's view, the development of offshore financial and banking activi- ties must not compromise the supervision and soundness of the financial sector. In addition to demand management policies, efforts should be stepped up in the implementation of appropriate structural policies to broaden the country's productive base (particularly in the tourism and fisheries sector, as well as the newly established offshore sector), and to improve labor productivity. The authorities also need to.proceed swiftly with the elimination of the remaining price controls, in order to provide appropriate signals to the private sector and improve resource allocation. Surveillance over Seychelles' economic policies has been hampered by the lack of timely and relevant economic statistics. While some data are provided to the Fund on a regular basis, other key data are made available only in the context of the annual consultation discussions. The staff urges the authorities to provide core surveillance &ta to the Fund on a regular and timely basis between consultations. Although Seychelles has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, it maintains exchange restrictions that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. The authorities have stated their intention to eliminate these restrictions in the future, but have no definitive timetable at present for their removal. Accordingly, the staff does not recommend F'und approval of these restrictions at this time. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Real sector The authorities have recently revised the fiscal, monetary, and balance of payments data, but corresponding revisions have not yet been made to the national accounts, which rely on data compiled by the Management and Infor- mation Systems Division (the statistics bureau). The Seychelles represen- tatives have stated their awareness of these inconsistencies and their intention to make the appropriate adjustments to the national accounts as soon as possible. The staff has urged the authorities to revise the national accounts at an early date to be consistent with the balance of payments and other financial statistics. Efforts to improve the coverage of the real sector data in Intema- tional Financial Statistics (IFS) began in late 1992, and significant progress was achieved during 1993-94. The Statistics Department of the Fund (STA) has requested that the authorities provide monthly updates of series on earnings, employment, and trade price and volume indices. Unfortunately, regular updates of these series had been discontinued. The staff has urged the authorities to improve the timeliness of these series, eventually lead- ing to their inclusion on the IFS country page for Seychelles; the authori- ties have undertaken to rectify this problem as soon as possible. 2. Government finance Government Finance Statistics (GFS) data on consolidated central government operations for the period 1985 through 1990 were reported and published in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). However, since 1992, no GFS data have been reported to STA for publication in the lJ The authorities, in addition to publishing some economic and financial data on Seychelles themselves, also do not object to the regular publication of such data by the Fund. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - APPENDIX I GFSY Given the current publication policy, have-to be omitted from GFSY publications. the page for Seychelles may In order to avoid this, the staff has urged the authorities to give higher priority to the compilation of GFS data, and to resume regular reporting to the Fund for publication in the m; the Seychelles represen- tatives undertook to resolve this problem by the first quarter of 1996. 3. Monetarv accounts The reporting of monetary data has been timely and regular. 4. Balance of navments Seychelles is in the process of revamping its balance of,payments database while converting data according to the guidelines of the Balance of Pavments Manual (fifth edition) of 1993. The authorities have temporarily ceased reporting quarterly data to STA, until they are satisfied with the quality of the data; meanwhile, they have provided summary tables, without codes and diskettes. In the context of ongoing communications between the authorities and the Fund, questions regarding the accuracy and classification of &ta on services and current transfers are being discussed. This issue was dis- cussed further during the mission, and the authorities undertook to resume the provision to the Fund of annual data for the years 1989-94, by the end of the first quarter of 1996, and to accelerate the conversion of &ta according to the above-mentioned guidelines.

Given the country's small size and access to commer- cial lending sources, the IBRD has had a modest assistance program in Seychelles. Two loans totaling USS10.7 million have been extended to help finance (i) the Mahd East Coast Development Project, principally for port improvements and the rehabilitation of the road network on the main island (1986), and (ii) the Seychelles Transport and Environment project (1993). The latter also received a USS1.8 million grant financed by the Global Environmental Fund (GEF). The IFC has extended four loans to investors in Seychelles: in 1987, USS10.5 million to restructure and complete a hotel for the Ailbe Development Corporation; in 1992, USS3.8 million to rehabilitate the Paradise Hotel on Praslin Island; in 1994, US$l million to provide new investment for the Acajoux Hotel; and in 1995, USS3.5 million to rehabili- tate the Coral Strand Hotel. So far, the MIGA has not extended any guar- antees for investments in Seychelles. Between 1989 and 1992, the Bank provided Seychelles with technical assistance for macroeconomic modeling, assisted in the preparation of the Environmental Management Plan, and helped conduct a Housing and Land Manage- ment Sector Study. Since 1992, the Bank has initiated a dialogue on medium-term outlook and policies, particularly on Seychelles' absorptive capacity for external borrowing. The Government has been responsive to the Bank's advice and put in place a multiyear public investment programming capacity, supported by an Institutional Development Fund grant (IDF). The Bank's main objectives in the Seychelles are to (i) assist the Government to develop instruments to prioritize public expenditure, (ii) develop essential infrastructure to improve social well-being and support economic growth, and (iii) provide support for environmentally sustainable economic activities and preservation of the environment. Moreover, the Bank will help Seychelles mobilize external support by continuing to play a catalytic role in aid coordination efforts, particularly through participation in sectoral Round Tables. Future Bank lending could include a possible infrastructure management project in the areas of water supply and sanitation. The economic and sector work program emphasizes dialogue on medium-term development policies and investment strategy through the discussion of the recently instituted three-year rolling public sector investment program. A Tourism, Infrastruc- ture, and Environmental Management Study, programmed for 1997, would assess past preservation efforts and institutional performance, and identify neces- sary adjustments to be made in public and private sector activities affect- ing the environment.
