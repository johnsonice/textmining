Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with the new Administration that took office on March 1, 1995 were held in Montevideo from March 21 to April 5, 1995. L/ The representatives of Uruguay included the Ministers of Economy and Finance, and of Transportation and Public Works; the President and President-designate of the Central Bank of Uruguay; the Director of the Office of Planning and Budget; and other senior officials. Presidential and legislative elections were held in November 1994 and Mr. Sanguinetti of the Colorado Party, who was president during 1985-90, won the election by a slim margin. The new administration has assembled a work- ing majority in Congress, which permitted the recent congressional passage of certain fiscal measures, as described below. In concluding the previous Article IV consultation in April 1994, Executive Directors underscored the importance of strengthening fiscal policy and restraining monetary and wage policies to lower inflation. Progress on a comprehensive restructuring of the public sector, particularly of the social security system, was viewed as essential for a permanent improvement in the public finances. Uruguay has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. L?/ II. Background During the period of the previous Administration (1990-94), Uruguay's macroeconomic performance improved on the basis of a strengthening of the public finances, efforts to break with the indexation of government wages to past inflation, the opening up of the economy, and measures to reduce the scope of government intervention in the economy (Tables l-4 and Chart 1). I/ The mission comprised Messrs. Guzman (Head), Jaramillo and de la Piedra, and Ms. Garcia-Herrero (all WHD). It was assisted by Mr. Wolfe, 'the Fund resident representative in Uruguay and partly overlapped with an FAD technical assistance mission on tax policy and administration led by Mr. Silvani. 2/ Uruguay's relations with the Fund are summarized in Appendix I. Fund staff has ready access to Uruguay's economic statistics as they become available, but the timeliness and the quality of the data are mixed. Most information on the public finances is available with a two month lag, except in the case of small public enterprises and the local governments where the lag is longer. Central bank accounts are available with a one month lag, but the accounts of the rest of the banking system have shortcomings and are subject to longer delays. Balance of payments data are available with a three month lag but coverage of trade, tourism and private capital movements is incomplete. The national accounts are available with a five month lag. Data on prices and wages are available shortly after the end of each month.

Real GDP growth averaged 4 3/4 percent a year in 1991-94, compared with an average of 1 percent a year in 1989-90. At the same time, the increase in consumer prices slowed from about 130 percent during 1990 to 44 percent during 1994, but progress fell well short of the authorities' targets reflecting slippages in wage policy in 1992-93, a weakening of the public finances after 1992, and external demand pressures (the program supported by the 1992 stand-by arrangement had targeted a reduction in inflation to 30 percent by 1993 and to progressively lower rates thereafter). Real wages increased by over 11 percent during 1991-93 before stabilizing in 1994. The unemployment rate declined from 9.7 percent at end-1990 to 7.6 percent at end-1993, but rose to 9.1 percent at end-1994 reflecting increased partici- pation rates. The public sector deficit was reduced from almost 8 percent of GDP in 1989 to approximate balance in 1992, but it subsequently rose to 3 l/4 per- cent of GDP in 1994. In the nonfinancial public sector, a rise in current expenditure of about 5 percentage points of GDP and in capital expenditure of 2 percentage points of GDP was more than offset by a rise in revenue (including the current surpluses of the public enterprises) from 23 percent of GDP in 1989 to over 31 percent of GDP in 1994. Social security outlays climbed from 11 percent of GDP in 1989 to 15 3/4 percent of GDP in 1994 as real wages and pension benefits increased strongly (benefits are indexed to past wage increases), while capital outlays were unchanged (relative to GDP) through 1992 but rose in 1993 and 1994. Steps to lower the quasifiscal losses of the financial public sector during 1990-94 included the transfer of some Central Bank debt to the Treasury. Since 1992 the peso has floated within a 7 percent band that has depre- ciated at a monthly rate of 2 percent vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. According to the Fund's Information Notice System, at end-1994 the peso had appre- ciated in real effective terms by 37 percent relative to its average level in 1985-89. This calculation is based on 1980-82 trade weights; based on weights reflecting the structure of Uruguay's trade in goods and nonfactor services in 1994, the real appreciation of the peso was 18 percent. Uruguay has remained reasonably competitive with respect to Argentina and Brazil which together'account for over half of Uruguay's exports of goods and non- factor services (Chart 2). In recent years, credit policy played a limited role in affecting aggregate demand because of the managed exchange rate system and the sub- stantial capital inflows that occurred in the context of an open payments system. The Central Bank targeted increases in net domestic assets in line with its objectives for money growth and net international reserves, but the expansion of the monetary aggregates generally turned out higher than envisaged because of an unexpectedly strong balance of payments. Currency expanded largely in line with nominal GDP, while broad monetary aggregates grew at a slower pace reflecting the real appreciation of the peso vis-a-vis Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 2a - CHART 1 URUGUAY SELECTED ECONOMIC INDICATORS, 1986-95 --t GROWTH, SAVING.

Interest rates on open market assets denominated in pesos tended to follow international interest rates adjusted for the expected depreciation of the peso; during much of the period 1990-94 these rates were negative in real terms reflecting the real appreciation of the peso vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. Interest rates on peso denominated savings accounts were substan- tially negative in real terms while bank lending rates were positive. High spreads in the financial system reflect the inefficiencies of the state banks (which dominate deposit taking and lending in pesos) and uncertainties related to domestic bank debt reschedulings mandated by the courts and the Congress on terms that were favorable to debtors. The external current account swung from a surplus of about US$170 mil- lion (2 percent of GDP) in 1990 to a deficit of about US$400 million (2 l/2 percent of GDP) in 1994, as investment rose from 11 percent of GDP in 1990 to 14 percent of GDP in 1994, while national saving declined from 13 percent of GDP to 11 l/2 percent of GDP. The U.S. dollar value of merchandise exports stagnated between 1990 and 1993, but grew by 16 percent in 1994 reflecting higher international commodity prices, a recovery of agricultural output and a surge in demand from Brazil in the second half of the year. The value of merchandise imports doubled from 1990 to 1994 reflecting the expansion of domestic demand, the opening of the economy and the real appreciation of the peso. From 1990 to 1994, tourism receipts (largely from Argentina) surged while net outlays on factor services declined owing to lower international interest rates, and the debt and debt service reduction (DDSR) operation with commercial bank creditors in 1991. Following an outflow in 1991 reflecting cash outlays related to the DDSR operation, capital inflows turned positive and the balance of payments registered surpluses averaging over US$200 million a year (about 1 l/2 per- cent of GDP) in 1992-94. At end-1994, official gross international reserves were almost USS1.7 billion, equivalent to about five months of imports of goods and services. Uruguay's total external debt rose from USS4.7 billion in 1990 to USS5.4 billion in 1994, but declined relative to GDP from 56 per- cent to 35 percent partly because of the real appreciation of the peso. The average maturity of the external public debt lengthened, but the stock of short-term bonded debt of the public sector remains at about US$800 million. Public debt service relative to exports of goods and services declined from 35 percent in 1990 to 16 percent in 1994. In the structural area, during 1990-94 a number of proposals to reform the social security system were rejected by Congress and plans for the partial privatization of the state enterprises were dealt a setback in a popular referendum in December 1992. Nevertheless, there was some progress in reducing the scope of state intervention in the economy: certain port and airport services were privatized; three of the four commercial banks intervened in the wake of the 1982 financial crisis were sold; the private sector was allowed to participate in various activities previously reserved Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- Ic - for the state (insurance services, certain telecommunication and highway services, and the management of the gas company); and the state airline is about to be sold. Modifications to the Law of Financial Intermediation approved in 1992 increased the supervisory powers of the Central Bank, improved procedures for dealing wit., h troubled banks and increased the transparency of regulations for establishing financial institutions. In the area of trade policy, in recent years import quotas were elimi- nated, the use of anti-dumping devices was curtailed, and domestic content and compensatory export requirements that protected the domestic, car industry were removed. Import tariffs were reduced from a range of O-55 per- cent (with five different tariff positions) in 1990 to O-20 percent (with four different positions) in 1994. Since January 1, 1995 duties on imports of most products from outside MERCOSUR (the regional common market with Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay) are set under a common external tariff (GET) ranging from 0 to 20 percent (CET exemptions would be eliminated early in the next century). Changes in protection levels as a result of the CET (relative to tariff levels in 1994) would not occur fully until early in the next century and vary by product: by 2005, import duties will rise for capital goods (from O-6 percent to 14 percent in general and to 16 percent for computer equipment) and will decline or remain unchanged for inter- mediate and most final goods. Most remaining tariffs on intra-MERCOSUR trade were eliminated on January 1, 1995 (exemptions--which cover products such as pharmaceutical, plastics, automobile parts, textiles and dairy products--would be eliminated by end-1999). Social indicators in Uruguay are relatively better than the average of the countries in the region. Social expenditure of the public sector is high but the quality of services is relatively low. In 1993, the general government's social expenditure amounted to 20 percent of GDP, one of the highest in Latin America; social security expenditures were 15 percent of GDP, education services were 2 l/4 percent of GDP, and health services amounted to 1 3/4 percent of GDP. Uruguay's environmental problems include soil erosion in farming areas, water and air pollution in urban areas, and the destruction of ecosystems. Some legislation to protect the environment has been enacted, but progress remains limited. Uruguay has not been affected adversely in a major way by the aftermath of the crisis in Mexico. In fact, in the first quarter of 1995 Uruguay experienced capital inflows from Argentina, reflected in a strong increase in deposits denominated in foreign currency and a lowering of spreads over LIBOR on Uruguayan financial assets. Although the expansion of output in Uruguay seems to have slowed reflecting lower tourism and export demand from Argentina and less externally financed construction activity in Punta de1 Este, the main tourist area, a decline in activity was forestalled by the strong expansion of merchandise exports to Brazil, higher output in agricul- ture and higher public expenditure. Relative to a year earlier, in the first quarter of 1995 exports grew by 24 percent, while the growth of merchandise imports slowed to 16 percent. At the same time, the tax/GDP ratio declined and the expansion of industrial activity slowed despite a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 5 - surge in car sales in anticipation of tax increases that will go in effect in mid-1995. In the three months ending January 1995, the unemployment rate increased to 9 l/2 percent, from 8 percent a year earlier. Inflation recently rose to around 50 percent on an annual basis reflecting the weakening of the public finances and price pressures stemming from the real appreciation of the Brazilian currency in the second half of 1994. III. Summarv of the Discussions The new Administration aims to improve growth performance in the medium-term by lowering inflation to industrial country levels and removing structural impediments to growth, while maintaining balance of payments viability. In the near term, the authorities are implementing a program based on a substantial reduction in the public sector deficit, together with monetary and wage restraint, to bring down inflation to 30 percent during 1995/96 (i.e., the year ending in March 1996), consistent with the mainte- nance of the current exchange rate policy. In addition, over the next twelve months the authorities plan to introduce reforms of the social security system, the tax system, the public administration, and the finan- cial system to improve the public finances on a lasting basis, raise private savings and investment, and enhance external competitiveness in the medium- term. The program assumes that economic conditions in Uruguay's regional trading partners will stabilize. Real GDP growth is expected to slow owing to a tightening of fiscal policy, as well as the effects of lower exports of goods and services to Argentina, while the external current account deficit is expected to decline to less than 2 percent of GDP. The staff agreed that the policies envisaged under the program were consistent with attaining the authorities' objectives, but emphasized that in order to sustain the envisaged exchange rate policy it might be necessary to tighten financial and incomes policies further if monthly inflation does not decline in the next few months as programmed. The mission also encouraged the authorities to implement additional measures to ensure that the public finances move towards equilibrium in 1996. The staff helped the authorities to quantify their economic program through March 1996 (quarterly targets under the program are set out in Table 5) and agreed to assist in monitoring program implementation, including through semi-annual staff visits. Given the risks of adverse external shocks, the authorities expressed an interest in discussing a precautionary stand-by arrangement once a satisfactory reform of the social security system has been enacted in the second half of 1995. The authori- ties' present program would form the basis of discussions on such an arrangement. 1. Fiscal oolicv Fiscal policy aims at lowering the public sector deficit from 3 l/4 percent of GDP in 1994 to 1 percent of GDP in 1995/96. Measures have Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - been taken to restrain the growth of expenditures, including curtailing hiring in the public sector, limiting discretionary expenditures on goods and services to levels that would reduce them by 10 percent in real terms relative to the previous year's level, and reducing capital expenditures by 1 l/2 percentage points of GDP from the relatively high level in 1994. At the same time, public sector wage adjustments are to be held below targeted inflation, as described below. Congress recently approved measures that would strengthen the public finances by the equivalent of over 1 percent of GDP in the program year. Tax measures include: an increase in the basic rate of the value added tax (VAT) from 22 percent to 23 percent and in the lower VAT rate from 12 per- cent to 14 percent, while reducing VAT exemptions; an increase in the rates of the tax on wages and retirement pensions; and various changes in the corporate income, agricultural and sales taxes to strengthen collections. The effect of these tax measures would be offset in part by a reduction of employer social security contribution rates in the manufacturing sector and an increase in family allowances for low income families. In addition, public enterprise tariffs would be increased on average by 33 percent during 1995/96 and enterprise expenditures would be restrained to raise the current account balance of the state companies from 2 l/3 percent of GDP in 1994 to over 3 l/3 percent of GDP in 1995/96. Additional changes to the tax system that are being developed with technical assistance from the Fund's Fiscal Affairs Department would be submitted to Congress in the course of 1995. These measures would curtail VAT exemptions further and close loopholes in other taxes. Measures to strengthen tax administration include transferring the collection of social security contributions from the Banco de Prevision Social (BPS) to the Ministry of Economy and Finance in 1996, strengthening the institutional capacity of the General Tax Directorate to collect taxes paid by medium- sized firms, and introducing incentives to encourage taxpayers to become current on their tax payments. The authorities agreed with the mission that the planned reduction in employer social security contribution rates should not be implemented until there is clear evidence that the programmed adjustment of the public finances is taking place, particularly as increases in already high VAT rates could lead to greater tax evasion. Also, the program relies on a large surplus in the public enterprises and mechanisms are being introduced to ensure that this surplus is achieved and sterilized in the Central Bank. Looking ahead, continued expenditure restraint and the prompt implementation of steps to broaden the tax base and strengthen tax administration will be essential to move further toward fiscal balance in 1996. 2. Incomes policy Incomes policy is to be tightened to support the achievement of the program's fiscal targets and provide a signal for wage restraint in the private sector where de facto indexation of wages continues to be wide- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - spread. Salary increases in the Central Administration are to be limited to 29'percent during 1995 and 24 percent during 1995/96, while wage increases in the public enterprises are to be limited to 36 percent during 1995 and 25 percent during 1995/96. Also, the authorities will seek to restrain salary increases in areas where the public sector plays an important role (construction, health, and transportation) in line with targeted inflation. Salaries in the rest of the private sector would continue to be determined without state intervention and are expected to remain about unchanged in real terms with the slowing of the growth of output and employment. The mission urged the authorities to adhere strictly to the programmed adjustments in public sector wages even if inflation exceeds expectations. This would require that the current wage agreements with public enterprise employees (which provide for four-monthly wage adjustments of 80 percent of the cumulative inflation since the last adjustment, with a catch-up increase to prevent real wages from falling below the December 1993 level) should not be renewed when they expire on June 30, 1995. 3. Credit policv The programmed expansion of the Central Bank's net domestic assets is based on an increase in currency in line with the projected expansion of output and the targeted rise in consumer prices, and an increase of US$40 million in the net international reserves of the Central Bank. Credit policy would be managed through open market operations and limits have been set on the expansion of credit to the private sector by the state banks to make room for more efficient private financial intermediation. 4. External policies The authorities initially considered adopting an exchange rate policy that would target the maintenance of external competitiveness through a more flexible management of the nominal exchange rate. However, in view of the risk that a change in exchange rate policy at this time might destabilize inflationary expectations and deal a setback to their adjustment and reform efforts, the authorities have decided to continue the current practice of depreciating the exchange rate band in line with targeted inflation. The authorities are of the view that a real depreciation of the peso is not warranted at this time: Uruguay remains competitive vis-a-vis its main trading partners (Argentina and Brazil) and, although tourism receipts have weakened recently, since mid-1994 the U.S. dollar value of merchandise exports has risen strongly and import growth has tapered off. Nevertheless, it will be essential to reduce inflation quickly through appropriate fiscal, monetary and wage restraint to prevent a further loss of competitiveness in the short run, while steps are taken to enhance external competitiveness through tax changes and structural reforms. The program envisages a decline in the external current account deficit to,less than 2 percent of GDP in 1995/96, which would help in reducing Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - Uruguay's external debt to GDP ratio. The growth in the U.S. dollar value of exports of goods and nonfactor services is projected to slow to 2 l/2 percent in 1995/96 because of lower demand from Argentina. Merchan- dise imports in U.S. dollar terms are projected to decline by about 6 per- cent in 1995/96 in reflection of the expected slowdown in domestic demand. Net interest payments would rise somewhat because of recent increases in international interest rates. Capital inflows to the public sector would decline reflecting lower public investment and the amortization of govern- ment bonds, but private capital inflows are expected to remain strong. External debt management policy would continue to aim at lengthening the maturity of public debt. 5. Structural reform The governing party and the party of the previous administration, which together hold about two-thirds of the seats in Congress, agree on the need for fundamental changes in the social security system. A reform proposal will be submitted to Congress shortly and is expected to be approved by August 1995. The proposed reform would lower retirement pension outlays of the main social security institution (BPS) relative to GDP from 11 l/3 per- cent in 1994 to 10 percent in 2000 and 9 percent in 2015. (In the absence of a reform, outlays would remain at about 11 l/2-12 percent of GDP.) The reduction in outlays would result from linking individual pension benefits to actual contributions to the system; an increase in the retirement age for women from 55 to 60 years over a ten year period and a significant reduction in pensions for individuals that retire before 65 years of age; an increase from 3 to 20 in the number of years of earnings used to calculate the pensionable base; and a tightening of eligibility for old age and disability pensions. The investment of a small part of existing employee contributions in complementary accounts managed by private or public pension fund adminis- trators would be allowed. Other structural reforms would seek to reduce the size of the public sector and make it more efficient by eliminating duplicate functions; modernizing the systems of budget administration and control; reducing public sector employment, making employment conditions more flexible and restructuring wages; allowing private sector activity in areas currently reserved to the public sector; certain public sector assets. and rationalizing regulations and privatizing Work on the reform is at an early stage, but it is expected that specific proposals would be submitted to Congress by end-August 1995 as part of the five-year budget law. The authorities also are seeking to strengthen supervision of the financial system, particularly by bringing the state banks and the saving and loans associations into compliance with the required reserve ratios, minimum capital requirements and portfolio regulations that apply to private banks. The authorities also plan to restructure the state banks with a view to consolidating their operations, curtailing employment, and reducing currency and maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - In the area of external trade, further progress in trade liberalization would require an acceleration in tariff reductions that are allowed under MERCOSUR, and reductions in the level and dispersion of the CET in the context of discussions within MERCOSUR. Steps being introduced to rationalize the trade system include: the introduction of a single export document in mid-1995; the strengthening of customs administration; the reduction of the number of agencies involved in regulating trade; the elimination of ad hoc anti-dumping devices; and the streamlining of trade regulations. The mission encouraged the authorities to strengthen the proposed reforms of the public sector to allow for a large reduction in public expenditure in the medium-term, while permitting a reallocation of resources to priority areas (e.g., tax collection, education, health and infrastruc- ture). More specifically, the reform of the public sector should target a reduction of government current expenditure (excluding social security outlays) of at least 3 percentage points of GDP from 1994 to 2000. The staff also recommended that the coverage of the social security reform be extended to the police and military pension plans, that the share of personal contributions channeled to the complementary pension scheme be raised to ensure its success, and that efficiency gains be sought in other social security programs (i.e., unemployment insurance, health insurance and family subsidies) by limiting their coverage and improving targeting. Also, private sector participation in the economy should be increased through the elimination of public sector monopolies and the privatization of public enterprises. The mission urged the authorities to seek the support of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank in the design and implementation of the structural reform program. 6. Continzencv plans The authorities are developing contingency plans in the event of a major worsening of the situation in financial markets stemming from adverse external shocks. These plans include the strengthening of the public finances (largely on the basis of expenditure restraint and a realistic policy on public prices), as well as the maintenance of the wage policy in their current program and a tight monetary policy. The mission stressed the importance of reacting promptly and in a comprehensive and determined way to exchange market pressures if they occur. The mission indicated that finan- cial support from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank for Uruguay's structural reforms would help strengthen the international reserves of the Central Bank beyond the programmed amounts. Further improvements in the maturity structure of the bonded debt of the public sector also would reduce the country's vulnerability. IV. Medium-Term Outlook The illustrative baseline medium-term scenario assumes that the reduc- tion'of the deficit in the public finances, combined with monetary and wage Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - restraint and structural reforms along the lines being proposed by the authorities, would increase efficiency, improve public services and raise private sector investment (Tables 6 and 7). Under this framework, national savings would increase by 4 l/2 per- centage points of GDP in the medium-term, to make room for higher domestic investment while limiting the external current account deficit to levels that would keep the ratios of debt to GDP and international reserves to imports largely unchanged. The strengthening of national saving would reflect: the lowering of public sector current expenditure; the reduction in the tax burden and the shift in taxes from producers to consumers; and the increases in private saving stemming from privatization of public enterprises and the establishment of private pension funds. The ratio of the external current account deficit to GDP would be expected to stabilize at just over 2 percent in the medium-term. Exports would expand strongly as a result of enhanced competitiveness arising from tax reductions and structural reforms. Import growth would slow in 1995-96 but subsequently would rise with higher investment and real GDP growth. Capital inflows would be sufficient to maintain official international reserves at around 5 l/2 months of imports of goods and services. Total external debt would be expected to fall from 35 percent of GDP in 1994 to around 32 percent of GDP in 1999, while external public debt would fall from 27 percent of GDP to around 23 percent of GDP. Alternative projections indicate that, if financial policies remain tight and structural reforms are implemented, slower export growth or less private capital inflows,could be expected to lead to somewhat lower invest- ment and GDP growth, while the balance of payments would remain viable. In contrast, in-an alternative scenario in which there is a weakening of the public finances, a relaxation of incomes policy and a failure to implement the envisaged structural reforms, inflation would be expected to be higher; investment, capital inflows and the external current account deficit would be expected to be substantially lower; and the growth of exports and GDP would be expected to be significantly less than in the baseline scenario. V. Staff Appraisal In 1990-94 significant progress was made in strengthening the public finances, reducing the degree of wage indexation, opening the economy to competition from abroad, and curtailing government intervention in the economy. These policies helped lower inflation and, together with strong demand from abroad, were reflected in increased domestic investment and higher output growth. Despite this progress, inflation remains high and a further substantial effort to raise domestic saving and investment and improve the structure of the economy is-;nee,ded,.,~,i,~- The staff welcomes the authorities' commitment to carry out a stabilization and reform program. Macroeconomic policies that are being Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - .implemented seek to strengthen the public finances and tighten wage and monetary policies with a view to lowering inflation and reducing Uruguay's vulnerability to adverse external shocks. Also, major efforts are being made to address structural impediments to growth: the reforms of'the social security system, the tax system, the rest of the public administration.and the state banks are essential to secure the solvency of the public finances, improve economic efficiency and boost domestic saving. In the short-term, a strengthening of the public finances will need to play a vital role in lowering inflation quickly to a rate consistent with the current rate of crawl of the exchange rage band. In this context, the staff welcomes the authorities' intention to delay plans to 'reduce'employer social security contributions in the manufacturing sector until there are clear indications that the fiscal program is producing the needed'results. Also, measures are being introduced to ensure the programmed expenditure restraint .in the public enterprises. Tight control over public sector expenditure and measures to broaden the tax base and strengthen tax admin- istration,will be essential to move towards fiscal balance in 1996 and make room for additional reductions in highly distortionary employer social security contribution rates in the medium-term. A strict wage policy in the public sector wiil be crucial for strengthening the public finances and providing a signal for wage settle- ments in the private sector. Thus, it will be essential that wages in the Central Administration be adjusted in line with targeted rather than past inflation, and that similar adjustments apply to wages in the public enterprises once the current wage'agreements expire in June 1995. Although the peso appreciated significantly in real effective terms in recent years, Uruguay appears to have remained competitive vis-a-vi's its main trading partners. '.The authorities intend to continue the current policy of depreciating the exchange rate band by 2 percent a month vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, while relying on structural reforms to strengthen export competitiveness in the medium-term. The staff agrees with the approach that has been adopted, but the authorities will need to stand ready 'to tighten financial and incomes policies further to ensure that inflation declines as programmed and to avoid a loss of competitiveness that would compromise output growth and external viability. In the current situation of increased uncertainty in financial markets it will be essential that credit policy be managed carefully to help achieve the program's inflation and balance of payments objectives. It is appro- priate that the Central Bank continue to undertake open market operations to control the expansion of its net domestic assets. The limitation of the expansion of credit by the state banks also is necessary until these banks can be brought under full compliance with the prudential and other regula- tions that apply to privat.e-ibanks-., '<1 .,! .,.. , .,, _ ._ Comprehensive structural reforms will be crucial for ensuring a lasting improvement in the public finances, increasing economic efficiency and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - establishing the credibility of the authorities' program. These reforms should aim at a substantial reduction in public sector current expenditure, while allowing greater private sector participation in areas currently reserved to the public sector. The envisaged reform of the social security system is a very important step, but it should be deepened and its coverage broadened to ensure a substantial reduction of social security outlays relative to GDP in the medium term; at the same time, a larger share of personal contributions should be channeled to the complementary pension scheme if it is to be instrumental in raising national saving. The reform of the rest of the public sector should target a reduction of goyernment current expenditure of 3 percentage points of GDP over the next five years, while giving more responsibility for infrastructure investment to the private sector through privatization and deregulation. A restructuring of the state banks and the strengthening of Central Bank prudential supervision of the state banks and nonbank financial intermediaries is essential to enhancing their viability and improving the efficiency of domestic financial intermediation. The authorities would be well advised to seek the support of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank for these reforms. The authorities should deepen the opening of the economy to foreign competition that has occurred in recent years by continuing to seek a low common external tariff for MERCOSUR, as well as by removing remaining nontariff barriers and streamlining trade procedures. The authorities also are encouraged to seek to further lengthen the maturity structure of the public sector's external debt obligations. The authorities have requested Fund staff assistance in monitoring the program described in this report and the staff believes that such monitoring would assist Uruguay in its stabilization and reform efforts. The authori- ties also remain concerned about the possibility of adverse external shocks and have expressed strong interest in discussing a precautionary stand-by arrangement once the social security reform is enacted around August 1995. In the meantime, the staff encourages the authorities to develop contingency measures, particularly in the fiscal area, to deal with possible financial pressures that could arise. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Uruguay be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

In addition, the Bank has approved two structural adjustment loans. The first SAL was approved in June 1987 to support export growth through export incentives and tariff reform; strengthen public finances and restructure the social security system; improve public investment programming; and strengthen the banking system. The second SAL supported the restructuring of the four failed domestic banks as well as the other structural reforms, including strengthening of the Central Bank's regulatory and supervisory role, improving public sector management and investment programming, revamping the revenue collection unit of the social security administration (BPS), and additional reforms in the social security system. The Bank's recent lending program has supported the modernization of infrastructure, and further development of agriculture and other productive sectors. The Bank also has lent support to improvements in the delivery of education and is expected shortly to approve support in health reform. The Bank will be discussing the future lending program shortly with the new administration.
