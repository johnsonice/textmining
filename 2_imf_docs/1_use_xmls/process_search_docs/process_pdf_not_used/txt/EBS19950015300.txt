Thus far, policy performance has fallen short of plans, yet economic performance has been better than expected. The authorities believe that fiscal and structural reform is still needed however, and have already submitted bills to Congress that would overhaul the country ‘s tax system and streamline government expenditure. Meanwhile, they have also modified monetary policy in response to evident shifts in the demandfor money, adopting a form of inflation targeting. They request approval of their second-year program under the arrangement, which they now consider as precautionary. The staff endorses this program, but notes that success will require strenuous efforts to mobilize political support for reform. Also, since the recovery is vulnerable to a resurgence of inflation and capital outflows, the authoriiies should maintain financial policies on the cautious side of the programmed limits and be prepared to react quickly if adverse shocks materialize. Since mid-1995, they have acted accordingly. *** This paper consists of four sections: Section I provides a self-contained overview of program objectives, program performance, and the policy issues; Section II contains the staff appraisal of policy requirements; Section II! considers the prospects for sustained growth with balance of payments viability; and Section IV discusses the authorities’ second-year program for achieving this objective.

Program Objectives Since the Philippines succumbed to the debt crisis in the mid-1980s, policy discussions have centered around one key issue: how to return the economy to the path of sustained growth. To achieve this objective, the authorities have for a decade been liberalizing and opening up the economy, while reducing macroeconomic imbalances. Yet while these efforts cleared away many of the obstacles to expansion, they have left a central impediment still standing--namely, the chronically low saving rate, stemming mainly from the weak fiscal position. Largely for this reason, growth has remained elusive. Even when economic activity began to accelerate in the second half of 1993, it was evident that considerable further policy efforts would be needed to transform this recovery into a durable expansion. To meet the challenge, the authorities formulated a medium-term program, the heart of which was an ambitious effort to overhaul the tax system and restructure government expenditure. In support of this program, the Executive Board in June 1994 approved a three-year arrangement under the extended Fund facility in an amount of SDR 474.5 million, equivalent to 75 percent of quota. ’ In the discussion, Directors emphasized that the authorities would need to adhere rigorously to their structural reform timetable; quickly bring inflation under control; and attain, then preserve, external viability. B. Program Performance In the event, structural reform has been held back by several factors: the fiscal reform studies took longer than anticipated; legal constraints make it impossible to introduce an automatic oil price adjustment mechanism by Executive Order, as planned; and nationwide elections delayed a number of other actions that required Congressional approval. Conse- quently, none of the structural benchmarks has been met (Appendix Table 3) and the structural performance criterion on the Oil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSF) has been missed repeatedly. In June 1995, the OPSF balance turned negative, meaning that there were no longer sufficient funds to reimburse oil companies for the difference between their costs and the prices they were allowed to charge. Financial policy performance has been mixed (Table 1 and Appendix Table 4). In 1994, large privatization receipts and lower-than-expected interest rates narrowed the consolidated public sector deficit to 1 percent of GNP, half the target. In 1995, further privatization should reduce the deficit again, to l/2 percent of GNP.

The authorities responded to strong capital inflows and upward pressure on the exchange rate during the first half of 1994 by relaxing the monetary stance, pushing base money consistently above the performance criteria. From July 1994 to March 1995, this resulted in a steady loss of reserves, which was particularly sharp after the Mexico crisis. For all these reasons, the scheduled reviews have not been completed.* Despite policy slippages, economic performance has been much stronger than expected.3 In 1994, growth rose to 5 percent, the current account deficit narrowed to 4 l/2 percent of GNP, and inflation declined to 7 percent. During the first half of 1995, both growth and inflation remained steady. Moreover, after monetary policy was tightened in the second quarter, reserves rebounded sharply, and all the post-Mexico losses were recouped. C. Policy Issues The divergence in policies relative to the program has been the focal point of the staffs dialogue with the authorities over the past year. In these discussions, there was no disagreement between the staff and the authorities on the basic policy approach. However, the deviations from the base money program and the slow progress on structural reforms have been a source of staff concern. During the last round of discussions,’ agreement was reached on two basic points. First, the original program reforms remain necessary. Over the next year, the authorities intend to focus on fiscal reform: already, when Congress reconvened in July, they submitted the long-awaited package of bills to redesign the tax system and reorganize the government. They also intend to resolve the oil sector problem, once and for all. In July, public hearings were initiated to consider a price increase to eliminate the OPSF deficit. In August, nonprice controls on importation and distribution were relaxed, and new *The first review was scheduled for end-November 1994, while the second was expected by end-March 1995. Only one purchase of SDR 36.5 million has been made, upon the approval of the arrangement. 3See Section III and the forthcoming Recent Economic Developments for a more detailed discussion. ‘Discussions were held in Manila during September and December 1994 for the review, and in June 1995 for the review and the 1995 Article IV consultation. The Philippine panel included the Governor of the central bank, Secretary of Finance, Secretary of Budget and Management, Secretary of Economic Planning, and other senior officials. The staff team comprised Mr. Al-Eyd (head), Messrs. Felman, Nagai, Parasuk, and Stone (all SEA); Mr. Bredenkamp (PDR); and Messrs. Fan&a and Nellor (FAD). The mission was assisted by Mr. Handy, the Senior Resident Representative in Manila; Mr. Waterman, Executive Director, also participated in the discussions.

Most important, a bill has been filed--for priority passage--that would first establish an automatic oil price mechanism and then, in January 1997, lift all price controls and abolish the OPSF. Finally, auantitative imnort restrictions will be lifted on agricultural products (except rice) and the recently introduced tariff reform program is to be extended to cover this sector. Second, the monetary program would be modified to accommodate the rapid, but uncertain, growth in money demand. To this end, a limited form of inflation targeting has been adopted. Provided inflation remains under control, the operating target will be central bank net domestic assets (NDA), to allow higher-than-expected money demand that generates unforeseen capital inflows to be accommodated. On the other hand, if inflation exceeds the monthly programmed path by 1 percentage point or more, the target will shift back to base money, to focus on reducing inflation. Most important, if excess inflation persists, the targets will be reviewed and reduced. The authorities expect their policies in 1995 to (i) achieve real GNP growth of at least 6 percent; (ii) limit inflation to 8 l/2 percent despite supply-side shocks; (iii) narrow the current account deficit to 3 percent of GNP; and (iv) increase reserve cover to 2.7 months of imports. So far, financial policies are on track, while the macroeconomic targets appear well within reach. In the attached letter and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, the authorities describe their policies for the second year of the arrangement in detail. They note that the next review is scheduled for March 1996, at which time progress in fiscal reform and in lifting quantitative restrictions will be assessed and the 1996 program presented.’ They also request a rephasing of the arrangement, with the undrawn amount divided into eight equal purchases of SDR 54.8 million each, or 8 l/2 percent of quota (Appendix Table 5). In view of the favorable external outlook, however, they intend to treat the arrangement as precautionary. Earlier this year they canceled the rescheduling agreed with official bilateral creditors in July 1994. II. Staff Appraisal The Philippine economy is finally enjoying the fruits of a decade of wide-ranging reform efforts. A strong and well-balanced recovery is now underway, fueled by exports and investment. Nevertheless, it is far from assured that this recovery will develop into a sustained, rapid, expansion, since significant structural impediments to growth still remain. Most critically, national savings remain modest by regional standards. Unless this problem is addressed, either investment will be constrained, limiting growth to rates that will not allow ‘The memorandum includes quarterly performance criteria for September and December 1995, as well as indicative targets for March and June 1996.

Underlying the low level of saving is a weak fiscal position. Although the “headline” deficit figures suggest that considerable progress has already been made, in fact the fundamental situation remains essentially unchanged. Excluding privatization receipts, the underlying consolidated public sector deficit anticipated for 1995 is no smaller than that incurred in 1993. Moreover, public sector saving remains low and public infrastructure spending constrained to patently inadequate levels. Worse, starting in 1997, privatization receipts will essentially disappear, while customs revenues will fall as tariff rates are reduced. Consequently, a decisive--and prompt--fisc.al consolidation remains imperative. The authorities recognize this, and have already put together a comprehensive plan to overhaul the tax system and permit the Government to be reorganized. Several aspects of this plan are crucial. The staff strongly endorses the proposals to introduce a minimum corporate income tax and reduce special fiscal incentives, which have proved costly and distortionary. Similarly, it is important that the Government’s reorganization aim at a substantial reduction in the size of the civil service. Previous efforts to mobilize support for reform have met with limited success. However, prospects now are more favorable than at any time in the past decade. Concrete proposals are already before Congress. The booming economy presents a propitious opportunity for presenting new revenue measures. And perhaps most important, the President, buoyed by the strong mandate his coalition received in the May election, has declared that tax reform will be his top economic priority. Beyond this challenge, though, lie other critical tasks. One is to keep inflation firmly under control and bring it down over time to the How ASEAN norm. Another is to preserve the balance of payments gains that have so recently been attained. Although by most measures the external position is healthy, it nonetheless remains vulnerable to a slowdown in remittances and to an unforeseen reversal of capital inflows, upon which the country relies to counter a large trade deficit. For these reasons, the staff would urge the authorities to raise their sights for reserves and aim to achieve three months import coverage in 1995, with further large increases in subsequent years. In addition, external developments should be monitored closely and the authorities should be prepared to tighten financial policies quickly should adverse signs materialize. Close monitoring of financial indicators is especially important for monetary policy, since shifts in the demand for money have made :it difficult to gauge the appropriate pace of monetary growth. In response, the authorities have decided to move away from their long- standing base money policy and toward a limited form of inflation targeting. This new approach is welcome, as it orients the monetary stance clearly around the ultimate policy objective. The staff also endorses the authorities’ policy of continuing to allow the exch(ange Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - rate to be determined primarily by market forces, while limiting intervention to building up reserves and responding to sudden shifts in capital flows. Nevertheless, the staff would have preferred more cautious monetary targets. The monetary program is formulated on the twin assumptions that (i) the monetary tightening in the second quarter was sufficient to eliminate any overhang from the rapid expansion earlier in the year; and (ii) the demand for money will continue to grow rapidly--at double the pace of nominal GNP. Both of these assumptions entail some element of risk, with potentially serious implications for inflation. Moreover, if the traditionally short lag between money and prices begins to lengthen, considerable monetary overshooting may already have occurred by the time that a rise in inflation becomes apparent. Accordingly, the staff urges the authorities to err on the side of caution and keep both central bank NDA and base money well below the program ceilings, as they have been doing since mid-year. Cautious monetary policy will need to be complemented by fiscal restraint. For 1995 and even 1996, only a limited deficit reduction is envisaged, because it will take some time to pass and implement the complex fiscal reforms. This pace of adjustment should pose little risk to the recovery, however, since private saving--tieled by continued growth in remittances-- should be enough to ensure that investment can increase without putting strain on the current account. Should private saving fall short and a tighter stance of financial policies be required, however, fiscal policy may not be able to react quickly, given the limited discretionary spending in the budget. This situation only underscores the need for prompt fiscal consolidation. Finally, there remains an unfinished agenda of structural reform. Over the next year, the principal needs are three. First, and most urgent, action is needed to adjust oil prices to reflect realities and rapidly restore the OPSF to balance; legislation to fLlly deregulate the oil sector by January 1997 should be expedited, if possible. Second, quantitative restrictions on agricultural products should be lifted promptly and replaced with tariffs that converge over time to the IO percent maximum, preferably at a faster rate than required under the Uruguay Round agreement, Third, the financially troubled National Power Corporation (NPC) needs to finalize and begin to implement its restructuring plan, under which most of its activities would be privatized. In sum, there is a strong chance that this year the Philippines will finally remove the major remaining impediments to sustained growth. Most notably, tindamental fiscal reform is finally in sight. Meanwhile, economic performance and prospects have improved substantially, especially for the balance of payments, reducing the financial risks to the Fund and allowing the authorities to consider the extended arrangement as precautionary. On this basis and in light of the policy undertakings in the authorities’ second-year program, the staff recommends completion of the review and approval of the request for waivers of non- compliance with the December 1994 performance criteria on base money and the OPSF balance.

On this basis, the staff recommends temporary approval of the multiple currency practice until March 1997. The authorities plan to noti@ the Fund of their intention to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4. An exceptionally wide range of statistics are provided to the Fund, on a very timely basis, and these are more than adequate for effective surveillance. However, after the deregulation of the foreign exchange system in 1992 weaknesses in the balance of payments data have emerged, which are now being addressed by the authorities with assistance frorn the Staff It is envisaged that the next Article IV consultation with the Philippines will be held according to the standard 12-month cycle. III. Economic Outlook and Medium-Term Policy Requirements A. A Sustainable Recovery? 7he last time the Philippines saw a strong recovery was in 1986-89, when growth averaged 5 percent per annum. That expansion, however, quickly collapsed amid high inflation and a balance of payments crisis. Will things be di;fferent this time? Although the course of the economy will be determined by the policies the authorities pursue, there are several reasons why the current recovery is more promising than the one before. --The economic structure is much stronger. Over the past decade, the authorities have implemented a wide range of structural reforms, aimed at opening up and liberalizing a once highly protected economy. As these have taken hold, manufactured exports have increased rapidly, transforming the external position in the process. Since 1986, the external debt/GNP ratio has been cut almost in half, to 57 percent in 1994, while the before-rescheduling debt service ratio has been brought down from an unmanageable 50 percent to a more comfortable 20 percent. Reflecting this improvement, the real effective exchange rate has been appreciating, unevenly but gradually, since 1990. 6Based on recent information from the authorities concerning the application of a prior registration requirement with the Central Bank in order to have access to foreign exchange from the banking system to service loans or remit dividends on the investments, it has been determined that this requirement does not constitute a restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - --These improvements have generated a remarkable surge in confidence and investment. Confidence in the country’s economic prospects had been building steadily since 1992, as political and macroeconomic stability were restored and access to international capital markets was renewed. The true turning point, however, occurred at the end of 1993 when-- 18 months into the new Administration--a policy of opening up electricity generation to the private sector succeeded in ending a power crisis that for several years had been crippling industrial production. As confidence swelled, investment registrations soared, reaching $19 billion in 1994, more than five times the previous year’s level. And by the first half of 1995, confidence had spread to foreign investors, prompting a sharp increase in foreign investment registrations and an upgrading of Philippine debt--notwithstanding the “tequila effect”--to two notches below investment grade. --The favorable nature of the recovery has allowed the balance of payments to improve. The trade deficit widened in 1994, as the escalation of capital goods imports outpaced even a 19 percent U.S. dollar rise in exports. However, most of this gap was covered by remittances’ --attracted by the improvement in economic prospects--which surged b:y 48 percent. Consequently, the current account deficit narrowed, while the capital account surplus doubled on the strength of higher net portfolio inflows and an increase in trade finance. These factors turned the overall balance around, from a deficit of almost $1 billion in 1993 to a surplus of equal size in 1994, permitting the central bank to raise reserve coverage* to 2 314 months of imports.’ During the first half of 1995, export growth leant to 3 1 percent in U.S. dollar terms, led by shipments of electronic products and supported by a broad-based rise of nearly all manufacturing and traditional products. Thus, notwithstanding an 18 percent increase in imports, mainly of capital goods, the deterioration of the trade deficit began to taper off. Reserves declined sharply in the first quarter, but monetary policy was tightened signtficantly in the second quarter, and by June they had rebounded above their end- 1994 level. Export and import growth are expected to slow somewhat in the second half of 1995, but the recent improvement in the trade balance (relative to GNP) is expected to be sustained. Meanwhile remittances should continue to grow strongly, narrowing the current account deficit to 3 percent of GNP. On the financial side, capital inflows should remain strong and well-balanced. Of the $4 billion in expected net inflows, half would be medium- and long- term loans; one-third foreign investment; and less than one-tenth short-term credit. These ‘Including inflows through foreign currency accounts. ‘Adjusted gross reserves (reserves less the amount of gold and securities pledged as collateral for short-term borrowing) in relation to imports of goods and services. ‘Although net international reserves exceeded the program target in December, reserve coverage did not, partly because imports were much larger than programmed.

A comparison of this recovery with the previous one is instructive. As of the first quarter of 1995, the investment/GNP ratio was 7 percentage points higher, and the export/GNP ratio 11 percentage points higher, than they were at the same stage of the previous expansion (Chart 1). Moreover, the trend is encouraging: both investment and exports are increasing at an accelerating pace, while at this stage of the previous recovery they had already started to flatten out. As a result, the risk that the recovery will be derailed by capacity constraints or by a sharp deterioration in the current account is much smaller than before. B. An Economic Take-ofP The authorities aim to transform this recovery into a sustained expansion that will lift the Philippines into the ranks of the fast-growing newly industrializing countries. In particular, over the medium term they aim to raise growth to 7percentper annum. What will this require? Although the economic outlook is clearly favorable, rapid sustained growth will only be possible if the chronic fiscal problems are addressed; macroeconomic imbalances are redressed; and the structural reform agenda is pursued vigorously. --The root of the fiscal problem has been the large government debt, which amounts to 70percent of GNP. . The large debt has compelled the authorities to offer hinh real interest rates on government securities, averaging 5 percent during 1987-94. Not only have these rates discouraged private sector investment, but they have placed a heavy interest burden on the budget, amounting to 6 percent of GNP in 1994. The heavy interest burden has led to an inflexible budget, limiting the ability of fiscal p,‘licy to respond to macroeconomic shocks. This problem has been compounded because the large transfers to Local Government Units (LGUs) are set by formula as a fraction of previous years’ revenue. Also, a 1994 law requires that civil service wages--which had been frozen since 1989--be doubled over a four-year period. In total, about three-quarters of the budget is essentially beyond the authorities short-term control, while discretionary operations and maintenance spending, which before the debt crisis accounted for about one- half the Government’s budget, now accounts for less than one-tenth of spending. At the same time, the room to maneuver on the revenue side is limited by the difficulty of raising taxes quickly. Consequently, the burden of macroeconomic management rests mainly on monetary policy.

In addition, the interest burden, together with inadequate tax collections, has led to low public sector saving, amounting to 3 percent of GNP in 1994--the main factor behind the country’s relatively low saving rate.” . Low saving, in turn, has constrained public sector infrastructure spending to 5 l/2 percent of GNP,‘l a level insufficient to address the backlog of unmet needs, much less the future demands that a sustained expansion would pose. --To address all these problems, fiscal policy must be aimed squarely at reducing the underlying deficit and the debt stock. A measure of the size of adjustment required is provided by the medium-term macroeconomic framework (Table 2 and Chart 2). To achieve the authorities’ target growth rate, investment would need to increase by 5 percentage points of GNP between 1994 and 1998. Given the external objective (see below), national saving would need to rise by an even greater amount, about 7 percentage points of GNP. During the next two years, much of the needed increase could come from the private sector--as it did in 1994--mainly because overseas remittances should continue to grow strongly, boosting national saving and narrowing the current account deficit. After 1996, however, remittance growth may well begin to taper off, since the portion that represents the repatriation of flight capital will inevitably dry up. Meanwhile, domestic saving is unlikely to rise, since the positive effects from higher corporate profits and from growth itself may be counterbalanced by the effects of higher taxes. Consequently, the bulk of the increase in saving in the outer years would need to come from the public sector; for the period as a whole, the required increase would amount to 4 percentage points of GNP. --To achieve this, an ambitiousflscal consolidarion will be necessary. The medium- term scenario assumes that fiscal reform increases the tax/GNP ratio by 2 percentage points. This would require considerable effort, since without measures the ratio is likely to fall, owing to a tariff reduction program that will reduce customs revenues significantly. Moreover, the required increase is considerably higher than the initial year gains from the tax package currently before Congress, suggesting at a minimum that there is no scope for these bills to be weakened. On the expenditure side, the scenario assumes that the government reorganizat:ion is sufficient to keep the ratio of noninterest current spending to GNP stable, despite the large scheduled wage increases. Once these measures are taken, the fiscal position will benefit from a large feedback effect: low deficits and high growth will reduce the public debt/GNP ratio, allowing real “To a certain extent, it could also be said that private sector saving is comparable to that in neighboring countries only because the tax/GNP ratio is unusually low. “Of which one-third is channeled into the power sector, leaving little available for roads, water, and other infrastructure needs.

Even though the staff conservatively assumes12 that real interest rates will be unusually high in 1995-- 6 l/2 percent, reflecting the “tequila effect” --and then decline only slowly to 4 percent in 1998, interest payments will still fall by 2 percentage points of GNP, lowering the deficit further, while making room for additional capital spending. --Meanwhile, financial policies must keep macroeconomic imbalances under firm control. Inflation, for so long high and variable, needs to be placed firmly on a downward path, so that it converges to the ASEAN norm of about 5 percent. At the same time, attention must be paid to the external accounts, to ensure that the recently attained balance of pavments viability is preserved. Although most external indicators are healthy, the country’s position remains vulnerable because the trade deficit is large--l2 percent of GNP in 1994--and financed mainly by remittances,i3 which are sensitive to the same factors that affect capital inflows. This means that financial policies must remain tight and the authorities vigilant, while reserve coverage should be raised. To provide a margin of safety, the authorities aim to reduce the current account deficit to below 2 percent of GNP by 1998 (Appendix Table 6). This can be achieved even if exports decelerate and remittance growth slows to 10 percent per annum--provided that the rapid development of the domestic manufacturing base is sufficient to slow import growth (to twice the rate of growth of GNP, in real terms), despite the tariff reductions. In these circum- stances, a steady rise in reserve coverage to 3 l/2 months of imports could be combined with a further improvement in the debt and debt service indicators. Among other things, this would ensure that the Philippines will have a strong capacity to repay the Fund, even in the event that further purchases are made under the arrangement. --In addition, structural reforms must improve economic efficiency. The investment and saving requirements are premised on the assumption that total factor productivity growth will improve to about 1 l/2 to 2 percent per year, a common rate in fast-growing countries, but one that would represent a sharp change for the Philippines, from current no-growth levels.14 This means that further structural reforms will be required, including in the trade, energy, and financial sectors. 12This is conservative because there are some signs that over the past year the improvement in confidence, reduction in inflation, and reintegration with international capital markets have already reduced the risk premia on government paper. However, the extent of the “permanent” decline ‘is still unclear, as interest, rates have continued to show large swings. 131ncluding inflows through foreign currency accounts, which in the absence of information about the underlying transactions, are recorded as service inflows.

Second-Year Program The second-year program makes headway in all these areas, based on the following macroeconomic objectives. ls First, to raise real GNP growth to about 6 percent in 1995 and about 6 l/2 percent in 1996. Second, to limit inflation to an end-year rate of 8 i/2 percent in 19% and rtduce it to 5 l/2 percent in 199.5. Third, to reduce the current account deficit to 3 percent of GNP and then to 2 percent of GNP, while improving reserve cover to 2.7 months and 3 months. To achieve these objectives, aggregate &mandpressures must be keptflrmly under control. Accordingly, the authorities plan to maintain a restrainedfiscal stance, while implementing a more flexible monetary policy. A. Fiscal Policy In the absence of any major fiscal measures to date, the authorities have made only limited fiscal progress: the underlying consolidated public sector deficit (CPSD) planned for 1995 is approximately the same as that achieved in 1993. Still, large inflows from privatization, a policy of using bank balances to repay debt, and rapid growth should allow the debt/GNP ratio to fall to 60 percent of GNP by the end of 1995 and to 54 percent by end- 1996. --In 1994, the underlying CPSD actually increased marginally, to 2 I/2 percent of GNP.“j Although some revenue measures were taken in the 1994 budget, they failed to make much impact. The increases in documentary stamp taxes, fees, and charges were offset by the additional interest costs arising from the central bank restructuring (See Box 1). The new law expanding the value-added tax to most services, which was expected to provide 0.4 percent of GNP on an annual basis, was not implemented, owing to a legal challenge in the Supreme Court. Finally, the 3 percent minimum import duty generated almost no revenue, as all projects registered by the Board of Investments (BOI) before January 1995 remained duty exempt.” “The 1996 targets are preliminary; the program for next year will be presented at the next review in March. 16Privatization receipts of 1 l/2 percent of GNP explained the sharp fall in the headline CPSD. The only reason why the deficit fell relative to the program was that interest costs were lower than expected, saving the budget 1 l/2 percent of GNP. 17Also, on January 1, 1995 duties were reduced to zero on some 300 capital goods, as well as on imports of machinery, equipment, and accompanying spare parts used in the manufacture of export products. However, these two exemptions will apply only for the next three years, after which time the coverage of the minimum import duty will become virtually complete.

The authorities report i an extensive set of statistics to the Fund, including all the core data. Not only are these of generally 1 good quality, but they are calculated at a high frequency and are reported promptly--although more recently balance of payments statistics have been delayed (see below). Moreover, all key statistics are published. I Nevertheless, in certain cases the statistics may not be measuring the variables that the ~ public--or the authorities--need to monitor. * Budget. Since the central bank was financially restructured in 1993, the Government has been paying it interest on P 220 billion in special securities, while receiving in return a portion of the central bank’s profits and interest from an earmarked account. Yet these transactions are not included in the government budget. This makes a substantial difference to the overall balance: in 1994, under the comprehensive Fund definition, the budget incurred a deficit of 0.3 percent of GNP, but under the authorities’ presentation, there was a surplus of 0.9 percent of GNP. This treatment has a real impact: not only has the announcement of a surplus made it more difficult to mobilize opinion in favor of fiscal reform, it has encouraged calls for tax reduction. * Consolidated public sector. Another related problem, which affects the figures for the entire public sector, is that the authorities treat privatization as revenue, rather than financing (or negative net lending). This has several effects: it understates the impact of the fiscal position on i aggregate demand, overstates public savings in the national income accounts, and in recent years exaggerates the extent of fiscal progress. * Balance of payments. A third problem is that balance of payments methodology needs to be modified to reflect the deregulation of the foreign exchange system in 1992, and to bring it into line with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Already, one major change has been made: movements in commercial bank net foreign assets are now recorded above the line, rather than below. In the future, efforts will be directed at improving data collection, especially on the transactions underlying remittances through foreign currency accounts and on foreign direct investment, both of which have now become significant sources of inflows.

The authorities are confident that the Supreme Court will eventually uphold the constitutionality of the expanded VAT, but because of the uncertain timing of the Court’s decision this measure has been excluded from the program projections.” To achieve this target, the underlying government deficit will be reduced by 0.3 percent of GNP to 1.5 percent of GNP2’ (Appendix Table 7). Nonprivatization revenues will decline marginally, to 17.9 percent of GNP, even as the recovery boosts tax collections, because interest revenues will fall sharply, reflecting the Government’s decision last year to reduce government bank deposits and use the funds to repay domestic debt. Meanwhile, expenditure is expected to decline by 0.4 percentage points to 19.4 percent of GNP. This reflects two factors. The debt repayment should reduce interest costs by 0.4 percent of GNP, even as average real interest rates increase from last year’s level. Equally important, a policy of expenditure restraint will ensure that noninterest current spending is maintained at about 10 percent of GNP. Within this limit, tinds are being reallocated fi-om subsidies and operational expenditures to three priority areas. First, in line with the wage law, the Government is increasing compensation by about 17 percent for the second year in a row, financing this partly by maintaining a hiring freeze. Second, maintenance expenditure for infrastructure facilities is being doubled, notably for the road network. Third, the Government is expanding its spending on social services, consistent with its Social Reform Agenda. Under this agenda, which was launched in 1994 in order to draw the disadvantaged into the economic mainstream, a series of socio-economic indicators have been established for 20 depressed provinces. These indicators are being used to guide the allocation of budgetary resources to the areas of greatest need, while specific programs are designed in consultation with local governments, nongovernmental organizations, and the business sector. For 1995, these programs will focus on manpower, education and training, socialized housing projects, and livelihood support. “With privatization, the CPSD would be only 0.3 percent of GNP. lYAs a contingency measure, however, the program specifies that should revenues exceed the program target for any reason, the windfall will be used to reduce government debt or increase capital spending, rather than increase current expenditure. 20With privatization, the budget would be balanced.

Fiscal Consolidation Realfiscalprogress is targeted to begin only in 1996, with the full effect of the complex and thorough-going fiscal reforms coming through in 199 7, when the underlying CPSD shouldfall sharply to i/2 percent of GNP. How will this be achieved? 1. Tax reform As envisaged under the original program, the tax reform package aims at generating a substantial amount of revenue for the budget, about P 16 billion (0.8 percent of GNP) in the first year of implementation, with further gains expected in subsequent years. Moreover, these revenues would be obtained not by raising tax rates, but rather by expanding the tax base and reducing the scope for discretion. In particular, the reform aims to tackle four long- standing problems. First, corporate income taxes are low because existing loopholes provide scope for firms to minimize or eliminate their tax liabilities. Second, collection from acJ valorem excises has been hampered by firms’ use of transfer pricing. Third, specific fiscal incentives have progressively narrowed the tax base, causing foregone revenue to more than double to 2 percent of GNP. Fourth, the yield from personal income taxes is affected by the complexity of the system. Two reforms merit particular mention. To ensure that all firms pay some tax, a minimum corporate income tax based on gross assets (or gross sales) will be introduced. Also, to reduce foregone revenues and promote economic efftciency, general fiscal investment incentives will be introduced and specific benefits provided by the BOI will be sharply scaled back. Under current proposals, the BOI will no longer grant tax holidays, while it will provide duty reductions and other fiscal benefits only to industries that are (i) exporting; (ii) have export potential based on objective quantitative indicators; or (iii) undergoing industrial adjustment, owing, for example, to a reduction in tariff protection. For a detailed description of the reforms, see the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (Attachment II). 2. Expenditure reform The authorities envisage that beginning in 1996 there will be a sweeping reorganiza- tion of the Government. Departments and functions will be merged or abolished, transferred, devolved to LGUs, or privatized. Employees made redundant will be given a separation package, to enable them to leave immediately, which will be financed from the normal wage bill allocation, plus a modest special fund of perhaps P 5 billion (0.2 percent of GNP). Still undecided, however, is the size of the retrenchment program and the amount of longer-term saving the reform should aim to achieve. During policy discussions, the staff urged an ambitious retrenchment, pointing out that the central bank was able to reduce its workforce by one-quarter when it was restructured. The authorities, however, saw much less scope for retrenchment in the Government, noting that in any case the streamlining would not apply to teachers, the military, or the police--which account for the majority of the 1 million government employees. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - The Government also plans to move ahead with the plan to match the responsibilities of the LGUs with the funds transferred to them, Although it is not now considered feasible to devolve an additional 1 percent of GNP, as originally envisaged, some smaller measures are planned as part of the broader government reorganization. Most important is the proposed cost sharing scheme, under which starting in 1996 urban LGUs would contribute 50 percent of the cost of certain projects (such as constructing schools, local roads, and providing irrigation), while smaller ones would fund lo-30 percent; LGUs would need to generate the resources by cutting other spending. C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy The modest 1995fiscal adjustment, together with the limited scope for aJisca1 policy response to shocks, places a heavy burden on monetary policy to ensure that the program targets are achieved Yet the authorities have recently had difficultly finding an intermediate target suitable for the task. For over a decade, they have been following a policy of targetting base money, while allowing the exchange rate to be market determined This policy, however, requires a stable demand.for money-and events in 1994 have demonstrated that this condition no longer hola!s true. After a search for alternatives, the authorities have chosen to pursue an innovative, more flexible, approach. 1. The search for a strategy During the past year, the authorities have shifted their monetary strategy as they tried to find a way of supporting the recovery while ensuring that inflation is kept firmly in single digits. --They have tried both a money-based and an exchange rate-based strategy, but neither has proved completely satisfactory. During the early part of 1994, the priority was restraining inflation, which was then hovering around 10 percent. Consequently, the authorities stuck closely to the base money targets, and when strong capital inflows (including a surge in remittances) materialized in the second quarter of the year, they responded by allowing the exchange rate to appreciate, while using sterilized intervention to smooth the trend. This policy also enabled external reserves to increase rapidly, to well above the program targets. As inflation gradually receded, however, the authorities became concerned that the strong exchange rate and large capital inflows might be signaling that monetary policy was too tight, endangering the export-led recovery. They therefore switched tactics: net domestic assets of the central bank were increased, pushing base money growth well above the performance criteria, until the exchange rate stabilized in November/December at P 24 per U.S. dollar, 13 percent higher than the end-1994 level. This policy, however, did not prove sustainable. One reason was that almost immediately reserves began to fall. Also, while interest rates initially declined--to 9 percent in October from 15 percent in May--they soon Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - began to rise again as inflationary expectations increased. (See Box 2 for a discussion of why this occurred.*‘) -Although there has been a shift in money demand, policy for much of this period has proved to be expansionary. There are some signs that the demand for money has, in fact, grown much more rapidly than programmed. The most obvious is that, despite the surge in broad money--to 27 percent in December 1994 and 4 1 percent in March 1995--inflation declined to 7 percent by year-end and remained there through June 1995. Moreover, there has been a sharp rise in the money multiplier, indicating a considerable acceleration in financial intermediation. This, in turn, reflects the improved confidence in the economy, as well as structural reforms that reduced reserve requirements, increased the number of bank branches, and spurred the use of automatic teller machines. Yet there are also clear indications that through the first quarter of I995 the growth in money supply outpaced this increase in money demand. From mid-1994, official reserves began to decline and when international portfolios shifted away from emerging markets after the Mexico crisis, $700 million was lost in just 2 months (February and March), reducing reserve coverage to only 2 months of imports. In response, during the second quarter the central bank tightened its stance sharply: from April to June base money was held constant,** prompting by June the peso to stabilize at P 25.5 per U.S. dollar and reserves to rebound above their end-1994 level. “Also see the forthcoming background paper. 22Adjusted for seasonality and the change in reserve requirements.

The Philippines’ Experience with Capital Inflows During the past several years, the task of monetary management has been complicated by strong capital inflows, generated by a number of shocks, including higher demand for money and substantial gains in productivity. This experience suggests three policy lessons. The first is that where fmancial markets are open and deregulated sterilized intervention mav not work even in the short run. Each time sterilization was attempted, it was quickly overwhelmed by market forces, even before any fiscal costs began to be felt. The problem was that sterilization preserved a large interest differential in favor of the local currency, while exchange intervention suggested to the market that if the exchange rate s to move, it would only be in an upward direction. This effectively created a one-way bet for speculators, and capital flooded into the country until the authorities were forced to abandon stetilization and consider other policy options (Chart 3, top panel). Second, when inflows are driven by simultaneous shocks, the exchange rate mav be a misleadinp indicator of monetarv conditions. In the second half of both 1993 and 1994, the authorities interpreted the continued strength of the peso as a signal that monetary policy was too tight. This would certainly have been true if increases in the demand for money were the sole factor behind the capita1 inflows. However, another factor was also at work: the improvement in export sector productivity, which since 1990 has been generating both accelerating export growth and a rising real exchange rate (Chart 3, middle panel). Consequently, both times that policy was loosened to stabilize the exchange rate, money supply began to exceed demand, causing inflationary expectations to increase, reserves to fall, and ultimately the exchange rate itself to weaken. Put another way, in a situation where the real exchange rate was appreciating, the interest rate that was low enough to stabilize the nominal exchange rate was too low to preserve price stability. (Chart 3, bottom panel). Eventually, to restore confidence, the monetary stance had to be tightened again--and when this occurred the exchange rate once mote appreciated. Third, capital inflows caused by simultaneous shocks mav require new sum-oaches to monetarV Drorrran-uning. When there are large money demand shocks, a base money regime is risky, because fmancial conditions can easily become far too tight--or too loose. Yet when capital inflows are generated by other types of shocks--such as an increase in productivity--an NDA-based program is risky, since it would allow money supply to increase and jeopardize the inflation targets. Since no one regime is appropriate for all the shocks that the Philippines is facing, the authorities have opted for a more eclectic approach that allows them to accommodate inflows as long as there is no evident inflationary impact, but switch to a nonaccommodating stance if inflation exceeds the targets.

A new apprkeh Foltowing these experiences in I994; the authorities decided that a new monetary strategy was needed, and chose to adopt an approach based on a limitedform of inflation targeting.” Although the second-year program is still founded on a benchmark money path, the precise operating procedures and targets will depend on whether inflation is adhering to a specific monthly path.24 As long as inflation remains under control, central bank NDA will be the operating target, allowing the authorities to accommodate unexpected capital inflows, which may be reflecting higher-than programmed demand for money. (For convenience, the base money targets are retained, but,will simply be increased automatically for any excess of net international reserves (NIR) over the program targets.) Of course, if the authorities suspect that the inflows may be inflationary, they could choose not to intervene, and thereby allow the exchange fate to appreciate. Alternatively, money demand may prove to be lower than expected, and inflation higher. If annual inflation exceeds the program target by 1 percentage point or more in any month, then the NIR adjuster will be capped at the previous month’s leve1.25 In effect, this would shift the operating procedure back toward a base money program, in order to focus policy directly on inflation control. In these circumstances, the authorities would respond to unexpected capital inflows either by allowing the exchange rate to appreciate or by sterilizing their intervention. Most important, should excess inflation nonetheless persist for more than three months, the staff and authorities would review the base money program, to see if the monthly ta.rgets need to be revised downward. This approach offers several important advantages. It establishes a clear objective for monetary policy, namely, reducing inflation. It also puts less weight- on intermediate targets-- which may be sending misleading signals--and more on this final objective. It allows a varied response to capital inflows, depending not on the nature of the underlying shock--which will be almost impossible to identify--but on its observable impact on prices. Moreover, unlike pure inflation targeting, this approach provides quantified monetary targets. 23’A pegged rate regime was rejected because it might not be credible; because the equilibrium real rate appears to be appreciating; and because the experience with exchange rate targ,eting in 1994 was not entirely satisfactory. 24Monthly inflation data are available one week after the end of each month. *‘The NIR adjuster could be zero, but not negative, since monthly indicative targets and1 q,uarterly performance criteria place a floor on international reserves.

As for the first assumption, the authorities noted that, tier three months of policy tightening, by June the exchange rate had stabilized and strong capital inflows had resumed.. As for the second, the authorities cited several factors, including expected improvements in confidence as the recovery progresses; increased banking sector competition following the arrival of new foreign banks; and continued remittance growth, some of which is flowing into peso bank deposits. Accordingly, the baseline monetary program targets a broad money increase of 30 l/2 percent during 1995 and 26 percent in 1996, faster than nominal GNP growth, but only slightly higher than the rates for 1993-94 (Appendix Table 8). With the money multiplier continuing to increase, base money would grow at a somewhat slower 26 percent and 24 percent, respectively (Appendix Table 9).26 Perhaps most important, virtually all of this increase is programmed to come from the external sector. Central bank NDA would increase by only 5 percent in 1995, and would actually decline by 27 percent in 1996, when the authorities plan to make a determined effort to raise reserve coverage to 3 months of imports. In discussions with the authorities, the staff noted that the baseline program, while built on plausible assumptions, could still prove to be expansionary. In particular, the staff noted that the sharp increases in the money/GNP ratio that occurred in 1993 and 1994 would not continue indefinitely (Chart 4, top panel). Moreover, should money demand suddenly slow down, the inflation trigger might not be activated until substantial monetary overshooting had already occurred, especially if the improvement in confidence caused the traditionally short lags (of perhaps three to five months) between money and prices to increase. In these circumstances, the authorities might well miss both their inflation and external reserve targets. The staff also pointed out that the monetary program would allow a very rapid 49 percent increase in credit to the private sector, which might increase the vulnerability of the banking system to bad debts--or to the risk of capital outflows (Chart 4, bottom panel). Consequently, the staff suggested that the authorities err on the side of caution and keep base money/NDA well below programmed levels. Also, the authorities might need to step up their banking supervision efforts. D. Structural Reforms The final element of the overall economic strategy is to stimulate growth by completing the process of opening up and liberalizing the economy. The authorities’ current efforts are directed at four areas: trade, oil sector, the NPC, and the financial sector. 26The base money and NDA figures have been adjusted for the change in reserve requirements. The targets for 1996 are indicative and preliminary.

Trade reform Last year, the authorities initiated an ambitious medium-term tariff restructuring program for nonagricultural imports. This program has already cut the top rate to 30 percent from 50 percent and reduced the number of basic rates to four.” The top two rates will then be gradually phased out so that by the year 2003, there will be only two basic rates of 3 percent and 10 percent.28 (In comparison, the current average tariff rate is 19 percent.) This program has not yet been extended to agricultural goods, because the last Congress did not have sufficient time after ratifying the Uruguay Round Agreement treaty to repeal the quantitative imnort restrictions that remain on a number of items--including corn, wheat, and root cropsD Now that Congress has reconvened, however, the authorities plan to move ahead rapidly. A bill to lift restrictions has already been submitted, which the authorities expect to pass over the next few months. Once this occurs, the reduction in agricultural tariffs will commence: most rates will immediately be brought within the new standard structure, while rates on the newly tariffred products will not exceed 100 percent, and will be brought down to no more than 40 percent by 2003. 2. Oil sector Events during 1995 have reinforced the authorities’ determination to push ahead rapidly with full deregulation of the oil sector. In August, a major step was taken when nonprice controls were lifted on the importation of refined oil products and on the establishment of petroleum refineries, oil depots, and gas stations. This will allow new firms to enter the market, introducing competition where none had existed before. The next and most crucial step is to depoliticize oil pricing. In July, a comprehensive oil deregulation bill was filed in Congress, which provides for a two-stage approach to full deregulation. First, an automatic oil price adiustment formula will be introduced. Under this mechanism, domestic petroleum prices will be reviewed at bi-monthly intervals and changed in line with movements in world prices and the exchange rate. Not only will this system prevent future deficits in the OPSF, but by increasing the frequency of price adjustments, it will also 27Exceptions will be made for the final products of industries defined as “pioneer” by the BOI, certain agricultural products that have recently been tariffied, and items that will be tariffied. Pioneer industries may initially receive protective tariffs equal to no more than double the rates in the tariff schedule, but by 2003 these must be brought down into the standard structure. 28Although the Government’s program covers the period up to 2003, the actual tariff reduction schedules issued so far extend only to 2000, by which time 80 percent of the rates will be at 3 percent or 10 percent. 29Rice is also subject to quantitative restrictions, but these will not be lifted.

Second, in January lo’:. “. this tightly bound sector will be t5llv deregulated: the OPSF will be abolished and price controls eliminated, so that market forces can finally govern this industry. 3. The National Power Corporation The challenges ahead in the electricity sector are no less daunting. During 1994, NPC once again recorded a deficit of 1 percent of GNP--after receiving 0.7 percent of GNP in subsidies, largely from fuel duty exemptions and fuel price subsidies through the OPSF. The company faces three problems. One, is that its leverage is very high, with debt constituting 80 percent of paid-in capital. Another, is that capital expenditures are high because the company must make up for inadequate past investment. The third is that the cornparry is purchasing growing amounts of power from independent private producers, at high commercial rates. Yet it has no way ofpassing on these increased costs to consumers, because its automatic price adjustment mechanism covers only changes in fuel costs and the exchange rate. Consequently, the underlying gap between the company’s income and expenditure is steadily widening, resulting in cash shortfalls that have been covered by commercial borrowing. The program calls for these problems to be tackled from two directions. First, the NPC has already asked the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) to modify its tariff adjustment mechanism so that the incremental cost of purchased power can be passed on to consumers; this should be implemented by early next year. Second, in late 1995, NPC will submit a bill to allow it to begin a comprehensive restructuring of its operations. Under this plan, the company will initially be split up into geographical and functional subsidiaries, each of which could then be sold. Over the medium term, the bulk of the NPC’s generation facilities will be privatized, allowing the company to improve its balance sheet and focus its activities mainly on power transmission. Nevertheless, since these measures will provide little immediate financial relief, the NPC will need to borrow a tirther $350 million on international capital markets in 1995, to close the financing gap arising from the expected deficit of 1 percent of GNP. 4. Financial sector To spur financial intermediation and private sector savings, this sector is being opened up to foreign competition. As envisaged, in early 1995, the authorities allowed ten foreign banks to establish branches in the Philippines, the first new entrants since 1948; many of these have already commenced operations. As a complementary measure, unrestricted entry was allowed for well-established foreign insurance companies. Finally, to reduce intemlediation costs directly, reserve reauirements were lowered in May 1995 by 2 percentage points, to 17 percent, several months ahead of schedule. Further reductions will take place by end- 1996. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 31 - V. Proposed Decisions The following draft decisions are proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: A. 1995 Consultation 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the Philippines’ exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 in light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with the Philippines conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance Over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. The Philippines maintains a multiple currency practice in the form of a forward cover scheme on oil imports subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. The Fund encourages the Philippines to eliminate this multiple currency practice as soon as possible. In view of the authorities’ intention to eliminate this multiple currency practice by end-March 1997, the Fund grants approval for its retention until March 3 1, 1997. B.

Technical Assistance: During the past five years, the Philippines has received technical assistance from the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department, the Legal Department, the Statistics Department, and the Fiscal Affairs Department. An expert from the Monetarv and Exchange Afl’airs Department was in Manila in December 1989 to advise the authorities on measures to improve the operation of the foreign exchange market, and an MAE mission visited the country in December 1992 to advise the authorities on base money management. In September 1994, an expert from the Legal Department visited Manila to help draft legislation on a minimum business tax. In January 1995 a Statistics Department mission advised the authorities on balance of payments reporting. Fund staff also participated in two World Bank missions on central bank restructuring during 1993 and a World Bank mission on public expenditure review in September 1994. Several proposals for reforms of the tax and customs system have been made in the course of technical assistance from the Fiscal Affairs Department. To assess the progress of the implementation of the five-point Bureau of Internal Revenue and the eleven-point Bureau of Customs administration reform package, four FAD missions visited Manila between 1992 and mid- 1994. An FAD expert was assigned as an advisor to the Bureau of Customs to assist in the area of import clearance clarification, valuation system reform, and revision of the customs code for a period of three months starting February 1992. The same expert was also reassigned to advise the Bureau of Customs on the eleven-point reform program for a period of 12 months beginning September 1992.

Lending for structural and sectoral adjustment (nine operations since 1980) also played an important role, with only one remaining outstanding policy-based loan: the Environment and Natural Resource Management Loan (Ln. 3360-PH), a hybrid loan of $150 million approved in June 1991. The final tranche for the Economic Integration Loan (Ln. 3539-PH) of US$200 million, approved in December 1992 was released in March 1995. There are currently 29 projects under supervision in the FY 95 portfolio, with $3,119 million in total commitments. In FY 95, disbursements totaled $398 million. In comparison, disbursements totaled $673 million in FY 93, and $480 million in FY 94.

Thus far, in 1995, the Bank approved the Leyte Luzon Geothermal Project as well as a Women’s Health and Safe Motherhood Project. The Bank is engaged in a number of economic and sector studies that will help to define development issues and future lending strategies in key sectors such as the financial sector, energy/power, public sector resource management, social security reform, water and sanitation, rural development, early childhood development, and private sector infrastructure initiatives.

The economic objectives and policies of the Government of the Philippines for 1995, together with indicative targets for the first half of 1996, are set out in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the accompanying appendices. These policies consolidate and build upon progress made so far under the Government’s medium- term program, which is being supported by the IMF under an extended arrangement approved by the Executive Roard on June 24, 1994. In view of the stronger than expected external outlook for the Philippines, we expect to make no further purchases under this arrangement, and expect request that will be used on a precautionary basis. In light of these circumstances, we would also propose that purchases be rephased. 2. The following quarterly performance criteria (defined in the appendices) are proposed to monitor progress under the program for the remainder of 1995: (i) a ceiling on base money; (ii) a ceiling on the borrowing requirement of the monitored public sector; (iii) a floor and ceiling on the outstanding balance in the Oil Price Stabilization Fund; (iv) a floor on the net international reserves of the monetary authority; (v) ceilings on new approvals of external nonconcessional borrowing in the 1-12 and l-5 year maturity ranges; and (vi) a ceiling on the outstanding short-term external debt of the public sector. 3. During the past year, we have surpassed our macroeconomic objectives, combining stronger growth, lower inflation, and a much reduced budget deficit with a solid improvement in the balance of payments. Developments so far in 1995 indicate that further gains in all these areas will be achieved. Progress in structural reform, however, has fallen short of our ambitions, as it proved difficult to muster the necessary political support for a number of important measures, including tax reforms and trade liberalization, in the run-up to the May 1995 congressional elections. Nevertheless, the Government remains firmly committed to its reform agenda, and is confident that much of the lost ground can be made up, now that the new Congress has convened. 4. Thus, by the time of the next review of the program, which is to be completed by March 30, 1996, the Government expects to have (i) removed quantitative restrictions on all agricultural products, except rice, and set new tariff rates in accordance with the Philippines’ commitments under the WTO (paragraph 34 of the MEFP); (ii) enacted the tax reform package into law (paragraph 27 of the MEFP); and (iii) enacted the government reorganization bill into law (paragraph 28 of the MEFP). This review will also reach understandings, inter alia, on the 1996 financial program and will establish the quantitative performance criteria for 1996. 5. The third and fourth reviews will be completed by September 29, 1996, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 51 - ATTACHMENT I March 30, 1997, respectively, and will assess performance under the program, with particular focus on the liberalization of the energy sector. By the time of the third review an automatic oil pricing formula is expected to have been introduced, to be followed by comprehensive deregulation of the oil sector, as described in paragraph 39 of the MEFP, by the time of the fourth review. 6. During the period of the arrangement, the Government will not accumulate any new external payments arrears, and will not impose new or intensify existing restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, or introduce or modify multiple currency pmctices, or conclude bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, or impose new or intensify existing import restrictions for balance of payments reasons. Indeed, as noted in paragraph 37 of the MEFP, we have established a timetable for the removal of the last remaining exchange measures subject to the Fund’s jurisdiction and will shortly notify the Fund of our acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4. 7. The Philippine Government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but will take any additional measures that are appropriate for this purpose. The Government will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, in accordance with the policies of the Fund on such consultations. Sincerely yours, ISI Gabriel C.

Introduction 1. The Philippines has finally begun to reap the rewards of a decade of policy efforts. Confidence in the country’s economic prospects had been building steadily since 1992, as political and macroeconomic stability were restored and access to international capital markets was renewed. Yet an economic revival remained elusive, on account of severe power shortages, which crippled production during 1992 and much of 1993. By the end of 1993, however, substantial new investment had fully restored the nation’s power-generating capacity. 2. As a result, economic activity began to accelerate sharply in 1994. The export- oriented strategy began to bear fruit, as merchandise exports increased by 19 percent, while net nontrade inflows (including remittances, other services, and capital) surged to about $9 billion from about $5 billion in 1993. Real fixed investment increased by about 8 l/2 percent, while investment registrations leapt to about P 500 billion ($19 billion), more than five times the 1993 level. 3. These developments were reflected in an exceptionally strong performance of the macroeconomic aggregates. Real GNP growth increased to 5 percent, the fastest rate since 1989 and considerably higher than the 3 l/2 to 4 l/2 percent originally anticipated. Inflation was brought down to 7 percent in December, well below the program objective of 8 l/2 percent. Owing to the strong growth in remittances, the current account deficit narrowed to the programmed level of about 4 l/2 percent of GNP, even as imports grew by about 21 percent. And finally, the large capital inflows enabled adjusted gross reserves’ to climb by $1.6 billion to $6.4 billion, equivalent to 2.7 months of imports. 4. The favorable trends continued into the first half of 1995. Year-on-year GNP growth remained an estimated 5 percent, as a strong expansion of industry and an acceleration of services compensated for a drought-induced slowdown in agricultural output. Inflation remained at a year-on-year rate of about 7 percent in June. Most encouragingly, export growth leapt to 3 1 percent in U.S. dollar terms, led by shipments of electronic products and supported by a broad-based rise of nearly all manufacturing and traditional products. Thus, notwithstanding an 18 percent increase in imports, mainly of capital goods, the deterioration of the trade deficit began to taper off. 5. This progress was achieved in spite of an adverse shift in the external environment. Following the Mexico crisis, non-trade inflows declined sharply, causing the Philippine peso to depreciate by about 7 percent against the U.S. dollar and adjusted gross ‘Gross reserves less short-term gold- and security-backed loan liabilities. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public‘- 53 - ATTACHMENT II reserves to fall to $5.9 billion at end-April, However, the authorities responded to these financial market tensions with a determined tightening of monetary policy (see below), which quickly restored confidence: by May, capital inflows had resumed and the peso had stabilized; and by June, reserves had rebounded to above their end-1994 level. Partly as a result of this success, in May-June the Philippines received a further upgrading in its international credit rating, to two notches below investment grade. II. Program for 1995 Objectives and strategy 6. The task now is to ensure that the economic upturn is transformed into a sustained economic expansion that will lift the Philippines into the ranks of the fast-growing newly industrializing countries and permit a widespread reduction in poverty. To achieve this goal,‘two basic policy strategies will be pursued. First, prudent financial policies will be maintained, aimed at ensuring that macroeconomic imbalances are kept firmly under control, so as to prevent any repetition of the boom and bust cycles that have plagued the economy in the past. Second, the government’s structural and social reform agendas will be pursued with renewed vigor, so as to spur investment, savings, and growth--and ensure that the benefits of this growth are spread to as wide a group as possible. 7. In 1995, the program will aim at the following three macroeconomic objectives. First, real GNP growth is projected to be 6 percent to 6 l/2 percent, based on the strong increase in investment and investment registrations during 1994 and early 1995, as well as the acceleration of manufacturing output and the surge in exports. Second, inflation is targeted to average about 6 l/2 percent to 7 l/2 percent. End-year inflation would not exceed 8 l/2 percent, despite a number of large supply-side shocks anticipated for the second half of the year, including a significant adjustment of oil prices and a drought-induced rise in food prices. Third, the current account deficit is expected to narrow further to about 3 percent of GNP, while adjusted gross reserves are built up by $1.1 billion to $7.5 billion--almost entirely during the second half of the year--so as to restore import coverage to its end-1994 level of 2.7 months of imports of goods and services. In view of this favorable outlook, the Philippines decided in late 1994 to cancel the rescheduling that was agreed with official bilateral creditors in July 1994. 8. As in 1994, the improvement in the external position will stem from rapid export growth, programmed at 24 percent; a strong rise in remittances; and improved capital inflows, including a doubling of foreign direct investment (excluding privatization) to over $500 million. These developments will ensure that the overall balance of payments remains in sizeable surplus, while the debt service ratio falls further to about 15 l/2 percent of exports of goods and services. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-- 54 - ATTACHMENT II 9. Further economic progress is expected next year. The preliminary targets for 1996 are to increase economic growth to 6 l/2 percent to 7 l/2 percent, reduce average inflation to 6 percent to 7 percent, narrow the current account deficit to about 2 percent of GNP and build up adjusted gross reserves to the medium-term program objective of about three months of imports of goods and services. Financial policies A. Fiscal policy 10. The government’s program aimed to reduce the consolidated public sector deficit (CPSD) to 2.2 percent of GNP in 1994 and further to 1 percent of GNP during 1995. As planned, nontax revenues increased significantly in 1994, partly because the Government increased fees and charges substantially in order to recover more of the cost of its services, and also because the privatization program was reinvigorated, garnering 1.5 percent of GNP. Moreover, the government’s measures to improve financial stability resulted in a sharp and unforeseen fall in domestic interest rates, which reduced budgetary interest payments by about 1.4 percent of GNP compared to the program. Consequently, the budgetary objective was achieved a full year early: the CPSD in 1994 amounted to just 1.0 percent of GNP. 11. For 1995, the Government considers that it would be prudent to build upon these fiscal gains, A further reduction in the fiscal deficit would promote sustainable growth by contributing to aggregate savings, thereby providing timds for investment. In addition, it would also keep the economic expansion on track by helping to keep the growth of domestic demand in line with the increase in aggregate supply. Consequently, the Government has decided to revise its earlier objective and aim instead to reduce the CPSD to a minimal level of P 6 billion, equivalent to 0.3 percent of GNP. 12. Consistent with this program, the national government budget position will be kept essentially in balance in 1995, with a targeted surplus of P 0.6 billion (P 15.5 billion excluding central bank restructuring transactions), compared with a deficit of P 4.6 billion (P 11.6 billion) in 1994. Government revenue is expected to decline marginally by 0.1 percentage point, to 19.4 percent of GNP, reflecting a fall in non-tax revenues. This was attributable to last year’s policy decision to reduce government bank deposits and use the funds to repay domestic debt, which will reduce interest receipts, but lower interest payments by an even larger amount. In addition, after a significant rise during 1994, fees and charges are this year expected to grow more slowly than GNP. 13. Meanwhile, the budget will continue to benefit from large privatization receipts, amounting to 1.5 percent of GNP, reflecting our determination to expand the scope: of the private sector and create investment opportunities, The budget has already received the bulk of these receipts, from the first of two equal installments for Fort Bonifacio, an armed forces camp in a prime Manila business area, which was sold to a commercial developer for P 39 billion ($1 l/2 billion). Moreover, by the end of 1995, the Government plans to sell a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 55 - ATTACHMENT II further block of shares in the Philippine National Bank (at least 8 percent), thereby privatizing the country’s largest commercial bank. 14. Tax revenues are expected to increase slightly, to about 15.6 percent of GNP. Over the past year, two important tax reform measures were passed by Congress, but neither is expected to yield much immediate revenue. First, the value-added tax was expanded to cover most previously exempted activities, mainly in the services sector. However, implementation of this law--which would provide an additional P 8 billion (0.4 percent of GNP) to the budget--is awaiting a final resolution by the Supreme Court. 15. Second, a law was passed that will widen the customs tax base and help reverse the steady increase in the proportion of non-oil imports that are exempt from duty, which reached an estimated 46 percent in 1994. Under this law, effective February 1995 the Board of Investments (BOI) no longer offers tax and duty exemptions on imports of capital equipment and spare parts. Instead, newly registering firms are able only to obtain duty reductions, to the minimum rate of 3 percent, on their eligible imports. The immediate impact of this measure, too, is likely to be small because on January 1, 1995 duties were reduced to zero on some 300 capital goods (as specified under a 1992 law, RA 7369), as well as on imports of machinery, equipment, and accompanying spare parts used in the manufacture of export products (under RA 7844). However, these two exemptions will apply only for the next three years, after which time the coverage of the minimum import duty will become virtually complete. 16. Meanwhile, expenditure is expected to decline by 0.4 percentage points to 19.4 percent of GNP. This reflects two factors: an anticipated fall in interest payments and strict controls on discretionary spending. The significant repayment of government debt during 1994 and early 1995 should reduce interest costs by 0.4 percent of GNP, even while assuming that average domestic interest rates remain at last year’s level. Meanwhile, the Government is managing noninterest current spending in a manner that would keep the ratio to GNP stable at the 1993 level of about 10 percent, in line with the policy set out in the original three-year program. Within this limit, there is still some room for needed expenditure increases. The Government is reversing some of the severe wage restraint of recent years, which had left civil service salaries far behind those in the private sector, by increasing compensation by about 17 percent for the second year in a row. This increase is being financed partly out of savings arising from the attrition law, which forbids the hiring of new workers to replace those who have left government service, except in critical cases, and which has resulted in an estimated 17,000 unfilled positions as of end- 1994. Similarly, the containment of operating costs has created scope for a near doubling of maintenance expenditure for infrastructure facilities, notably for the road network. 17. Furthermore, the Government is expanding its spending on social services-- such as education, health, and welfare--in order to continue its fight against the high incidence of poverty. In 1994, the Government launched a Social Reform Agenda, which aims to draw the disadvantaged into the political and economic mainstream. Under this agenda, a series of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicATTACHMENT II - 56 - socio-economic indicators have been established for the 20 most depressed provinces. These indicators are being used to guide the allocation of budgetary resources to the areas of greatest need, while specific programs are being designed in consultation with local governments, nongovernmental organizations, and the business sector. For 1995, these programs will focus on manpower education and training, socialized housing projects, and livelihood support. Reflecting the importance placed on them, social expenditures are expected to increase by 26 percent to P 105 billion in 1995. 18. Finally, the National Government plans to expand its investment spending by 18 percent, to 3.1 percent of GNP. Much of the increase is being devoted to infrastructure projects that would help the agricultural sector to compete with imported products once quantitative restrictions on agricultural products are lifted, consistent with the country’s obligations under the Uruguay Round agreement. In particular, substantial amounts have been allocated for spending on irrigation projects, post-harvest facilities, and other agricultural support services. Funding for training programs and regional growth center developments has also been increased substantially, to improve the manufacturing sector’s ability to compete in the new international environment. Moreover, to supplement these government efforts, in 1994 Congress introduced a variety of new mechanisms under which the private sector can participate in the development of public infrastructure. 19. Now that Congress has reconvened after the nationwide elections, the Government intends to push ahead with its planned comprehensive tax reform program (see Annex). Should any of these measures be implemented in 1995 or more generally, should revenues exceed the program targets, the additional resources will be prioritized towards reducing the level of government debt, which amounted to about 70 percent of GNP at end- 1994, or to increasing investment in infrastructure, rather than increasing current spending. B. Monetary policy 20. Monetary policy in 1994 was aimed at striking a judicious balance between accommodating the much stronger growth of the economy and putting continued downward pressure on the rate of inflation. On the supply side, monetary growth was spurred by intervention in the foreign exchange market--particularly in the first semester, when there was a large capital inflow and considerable upward pressure on the peso. In addition, during the second semester there was a rapid rundown of government deposits. Although much of the expansionary impact of these measures was sterilized through open market operations, monetary expansion nonetheless turned out to be higher than anticipated. At the same tim’e, however, improved confidence, strengthened activity, and better prospects all boosted the demand for money. Consequently, even though broad money increased by 27 percent in 1994, inflation was lower than programmed. 21. In early 1995, there was a temporary but sharp shift in financial market conditions. The Mexico crisis and the collapse of Baring Brothers caused investor sentiment to shift away from emerging markets such as the Philippines, and non-trade inflows declined Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 ,- ATTACHMENT II considerably. -1nitially;the authorities reacted both by intervening in the foreign exchange market in order to prevent an excessive depreciation of the peso and by raising central bank overnight borrowing rates. Subsequently, as pressures continued, the monetary stance was gradually tightened. For three months, from April to June, base money was held nearly constant in nominal terms, and interest rates on 9 1 -day treasury bills increased to 15 percent in April, compared with 10 percent in January. This tightening of monetary stance bolstered confidence, prompting renewed capital inflows, allowing the exchange rate to stabilize, reserves to be reconstituted, and interest rates to decline. 22. This prudent, yet flexible stance will be maintained. During the remainder of 1995, the demand for money is likely to continue to grow rapidly, for several reasons. Growth is expected to accelerate. Confidence should improve further as the recovery becomes more firmly entrenched and the external position continues to strengthen. Furthermore, the rapid expansion of banking sector activities, including new branches and new financial products, should spur additional increases in financial intermediation. Accordingly, the baseline monetary program targets a broad money increase of 30 l/2 percent during 1995, faster than nominal GNP growth, but only slightly above the rate for 1994. 23. This target will be pursued by controlling base money, which is programmed to grow at a somewhat slower rate of 26 percen?, since the money multiplier is expected to continue to increase as financial intermediation expands. Most significantly, the base money expansion will come mainly fi-om net international reserves. To help achieve this target, the National Government will closely coordinate its financing policy with the central bank, notably by strengthening the programming and monitoring of its cash balances. For 1996, the preliminary monetary targets have been set at 26 percent for broad money and 24 percent for base money. 24. At the same time, the monetary program incorporates flexibility in case the rapid changes in the Philippine economic environment cause the demand for money to deviate from projected levels. One possibility is that money demand may increase faster than programmed, and cause an unexpectedly large inflow of capital from abroad. In this event, the base money limits will be automatically increased by the amount of the excess of net international reserves (NIR) of the central bank over the program targets, provided that inflation remains in line with the programmed path. Alternatively, there is a possibility that money demand may prove to be lower than expected, and inflation higher. If actual 12-month inflation exceeds the programmed amount by 1 percentage point or more in any month, then the adjuster will be capped at the previous month’s level. If excess inflation still persists, then base money will be reviewed. *Adjusted for seasonality, as well as the reduction in reserve requirements by 2 percentage points, as envisaged under the program. 3Adjusted for the change in reserve requirements; 20 percent on an unadjusted basis. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 58 - ATTACHMENT II 25. The automatic adjuster for NIR overperformance would provide needed flexibility to intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent an excessive appreciation in the case of a surge in capital ,inflows. However, apart from these circumstances, the excha,nge rate will continue to be determined primarily by market forces, with intervention in the foreign exchange market limited to smoothing out fluctuations and building up reserves to programmed levels. Structural policies 26. During 1994, progress in structural reform fell short of our ambitions, for a number of reasons. Implementation of the expanded VAT law was held up by a challenge through the Supreme Court. Legal considerations also made it impossible for the Government to introduce the automatic oil price adjustment mechanism by Executive Order, as planned-- and while a bill to enable this was submitted, Congress did not have sufficient time before the election to consider such a weighty reform. Similarly, the tax reform also ran into the onset of the election season, as the Presidential Task Force on Tax and Tariff Reforms needed to make more extensive consultations with the private sector before it could finalize its proposals. Now that the elections are over and the fiscal reform bills drafted, however, the Government plans to move ahead quickly with our structural reform agenda. A. Fiscal consolidation 27. As envisaged under the program, the Task Force has developed a comprehensive package of tax reforms aimed at establishing a tax system that is simple, broad-based, and efficient, with minimal scope for discretion. Moreover, the reforms are estimated to yield substantial revenue for the budget--about P 16 billion, or about 0.8 percent of GNP, in the first year of implementation, with further gains expected in subsequent years. These revenues would be obtained mainly by expanding the tax base and improving collection efficiency, rather than imposing new taxes. The bill on the individual income and corporate income tax has been filed in both Houses of Congress. Bills have been drafted on the excise tax and fiscal incentives reforms which shall be submitted to Congress shortly. In his State of the Nation Address, the President gave top priority to the proposed tax reform measures under the legislative agenda of the administration. The passage of the measures is expected by the end of the year. The highlights of the proposed tax reform bills are shown in Annex I. 28. Progress on expenditure reform has also begun to accelerate. In July, a government reorganization bill was submitted to Congress and certified as urgent that will give the President the authority to streamline the National Government. Once the bill is passed, a set of Executive Orders would be issued that would indicate which departments or functions are to be merged or abolished, transferred, devolved to Local Government Units, or privatized. After a.planning period of approximately 120 days, actual implementation would begin. To provide for the resulting separation costs, the draft 1996 budget includes an allocation for the full year’s salaries of all existing workers, plus a special fund of P 5 billion, equivalent to 5 l/2 percent of the.basic wage bill. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicATTACHMENT 11 - 59 - 29. As in previous years, the financial position of the National Power Corporation (NPC) remains difficult. This problem will be tackled from two directions. First, the tariff- setting system will be modified so as to ensure that rates correspond more closely to actual power costs. As an initial measure, in 1994 the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) allowed NPC to adjust its tariff rate automatically on a monthly basis for changes in fuel costs and/or the exchange rate. In July 1995 NPC filed a manifestation with ERB for a change in the formula that will enable the company to Mly pass on the incremental cost of power purchased from independent power producers. 30. Second, a comprehensive restructuring program will be initiated, under which the bulk of NPC’s generation facilities will gradually be privatized, so that over the medium- term the corporation’s activities will be limited mainly to power transmission. Already, in early 1995, Executive Order (EO) 215 was amended to remove the company’s exclusive right to purchase from independent power producers, while several power plants have been turned over to the private sector under rehabilitate-operate-maintain contracts. These steps will be followed in late 1995 by the introduction to Congress of a comprehensive electricity sector bill, which will: amend PD 40 and revoke NPC’s monopoly over power generation; amend R4 6395 to allow NPC to restructure and privatize; and create independent subsidiaries which would then be sold. It is expected that this law will be passed during 1996, allowing a comprehensive privatization effort to begin in late 1996. 31. These measures, however, will provide little immediate financial relief. Indeed, despite internationally high tariff rates and substantial assistance from the National Government, the company’s deficit is still expected to amount to about 1 percent of GNP in 1995, of which less than half could be financed from net external concessional project borrowing. While it will therefore be necessary for NPC to resort to medium-term borrowings (with government guarantee) on international capital markets, this mode of financing will be carefUlly monitored and strictly limited. B. Economic Liberalization 32. A key element of the overall economic strategy is to stimulate growth by completing the process of liberalizing the economy. This will focus on a further opening of the economy to trade and investment. Last year, the Government took a major step in this direction by initiating a medium-term program to reduce tariffrates and rationalize the tariff structure. Under this program, the maximum tariff rate will immediately be reduced from 50 percent to 30 percent, while the number of basic rates will be reduced to four. The top two rates will then be gradually phased out over an eight-year period so that by the year 2003, there will be only two basic rates of 3 and 10 percent. Implementation of this program is proceeding in four stages. The first two stages were completed in July and September 1994 when EOs 189 and 204 were promulgated. The first EO reduced the tariff rates on capital equipment, while the second reduced rates on garments and textiles, including chemical inputs. The third stage was completed in July 1995, when an EO was issued specifying the tariff reduction schedule for the period 1995-2000 for all other industrial goods under Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 60 - ATTACHMENT II Chapters 25-97 of the Tariff and Customs Code. Finally, once the necessary legislation has been enacted to remove quantitative restrictions on certain agricultural products, a fourth EO will set the new tariff rates for agricultural goods under Chapters l-24 of the Code. 33. Aside from the three-year exemptions mentioned in paragraph 15, there will be four significant, but temporary, exceptions to the new tariff structure. The first relates to the tariffs on the final products of basic industries registered with the BOI on a pioneer status, which may initially receive protective tariffs equal to no more than double the rates specified under the tariff reduction program. However, by the year 2003 these tariffs, too, shall be brought down to either the minimum rate of 3 perc,ent or the maximum rate of 10 percent. The second relates to the tariffs on commodities that are subject to quantitative restrictions, which may likewise be increased if warranted, up to 100 percent of the applicable rates at the time of liberalization. These tariffs shall also be phased down over until they reach either the minimum rate of 3 percent or the maximum rate of 10 percent, by the year 2003. The third concerns commodities for which tariff rates were adjusted upward under EO 8 when quantitative restrictions were lifted. For these items, the phase down schedule specified in the EO shall be maintained until 1996, after which the rates shall be gradually reduced in accordance with the general guidelines for tariff restructuring. 34. The fourth relates to agricultural products that are subject to quantitative import restrictions under existing legislation/memorandum orders. Already, bills have been filed in Congress to remove quantitative restrictions currently imposed on corn, wheat, and certain other agricultural products by amending Presidential Decree 4 and repealing the relevant provisions of Republic Acts 1296 and 7607. These bills have been certified as urgent, and it is expected that tariffication will take place by March 1996. This would leave rice as the only agricultural import subject to quantitative restriction, bringing the Philippines into line with its commitments under the GATT-Uruguay Round. Tariff rates on these and other agricultural products have yet to be decided, but they will be set in accordance with the tariffication procedures under the GATT-Uruguay Round Agreements. 35. To further reduce import costs, legislation will be introduced later this year to shift the method of import duty valuation from home consumption value to export value based on the Brussels definition, as a prelude to adopting transactions value within a five-year period, as permitted under the Uruguay Round agreement. 36. Trade liberalization is being complemented by the relaxation of restrictions on the exchange system. We have already: (i) eliminated limitations on the repatriation of capital and income associated with debt-equity conversions; and (ii) reduced forward cover granted to oil companies to 90 days from 180 days and established a timetable for its elimination by December 1996. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 61 - ATTACHMENT II 37. Having established a clear timetable for the removal of the multiple currency practice associated with the forward cover scheme, which constitutes the only remaining measure subject to the Fund’s jurisdiction, the authorities will shortly not@ the Fund of their acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. This step will send a clear signal to the public that the exchange system is liberal--and will remain so. 38. Foreign investment regulations are also being further liberalized. As anticipated, no sectors were included in the first regular Negative List C--which restricts foreign entry in areas “adequately covered” by domestic firms--when it took effect in October 1994. The Government expects that amendments to the Foreign Investment Act will be passed during 1995 easing restrictions under List B, inter alia, to allow the entry of more small and medium-scale foreign firms and eliminating List C altogether. 39. A final main element of the medium-term program is the liberalization of the oil sector. In early 1995, the Department of Energy issued an Administrative Order (AO) that provides for the relaxation of nonprice rules and regulations governing certain activities. Specifically, this A0 allows new firms to enter the industry and existing firms to expand, by lifting controls on the importation and/or exportation of refined oil products; and construction and establishment of processing/blending plants, depots, storage, gasoline stations, other marketing facilities, and LPG refilling plants outside Metro Manila. This A0 will become effective in September 1995. Moreover, in July an Omnibus Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Bill was filed in Congress. This bill provides for a two-stage approach to full deregulation. First, an automatic oil pricing formula will be introduced, which shall be implemented by the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) after conducting public hearings. At that time, domestic prices will be adjusted in line with the changes in the peso landed cost of crude oil so as to ensure that the balance in the Oil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSF) does not turn negative or exceed P 2 billion. Second, in January 1997, the OPSF will be abolished, price controls will be lifted, and all limitation on new entrants eliminated, so that market forces become the central regulating mechanism governing the downstream oil industry. This bill is a priority measure of the Government, and its passage is expected no later than June 1996. 40. In the meantime, to address the emerging deficit in the OPSF, the ERB is conducting extensive public hearings on possible upward adjustments in oil prices, and a decision is expected in the very near future. During the months preceding the introduction of the automatic pricing formula, oil prices shall be adjusted as necessary so as to reconstitute the OPSF surplus, but only to a level not exceeding P 2 billion. Moreover, cross product subsidies shall be gradually eliminated during the period leading to full deregulation.

First, the system of corporate taxes will be radically restructured, to improve efficiency and generate about P 5 billion in revenue. The base of the corporate income tax will be broadened by limiting deductions only to expenses which are least subject to abuse and the use of discretion. A negative list will include foreign travel (except for exporters), entertainment, representation, and interest expenses related to the purchase of government securities. Ceilings will be instituted for certain expenses such as training, domestic travel, and advertisements. 2. Moreover, to further broaden the tax base, all firms will be required to pay some income tax. Corporations with assets in excess of P 2 million will be made subject to a 1 percent minimum corporate income tax (MCIT) on either the value of gross assets or gross sales. These corporations will pay the MCIT or the regular corporate tax, whichever is greater. At the same time, to encourage small firms to declare taxes, a simple system with a low tax rate will be established for those businesses with sales of less than P 500,000. 3. Second, the personal income tax will be reformed so as to simplifjl an extremely complex system and raise P 2 l/Z billion in revenue. The number of tax brackets will be reduced from 10 to 3, with the minimum rate increased to 10 percent, the middle rate set at 20 percent, and the top rate lowered to 30 percent from the current maximum of 35 percent. In addition, higher personal deductions and dependent exemptions will be introduced, which will remove many low income families from the tax rolls, thus allowing the tax authorities to focus their efforts on a smaller number of higher-yielding returns. The exemptions will also result in a large revenue loss, but this will be more than recouped by reintroducing the withholding tax on dividends and by taxing income from unincorporated businesses on the same basis as corporate income. Moreover, fringe benefits provided by employers will also be subject to a 30 percent final withholding tax. 4. Third, the system of excise taxation will be comprehensively overhauled, in order to generate about P 6 billion in revenue. The present ineffective ad valorem excises will be replaced by specific excises on beer, cigarettes, and petroleum products, at much higher rates. Moreover, there will be an automatic mechanism to ensure that the rates for beer and cigarettes are adjusted for inflation on a frequent and regular basis. 5. Fourth, tax exemptions will be sharply curtailed, thereby improving revenues by about P 2 l/2 billion in the first year and by considerably more over the medium term. This reform will aim at reducing specific investment incentives provided by the Board of Investments (BOX) and under special laws, and replacing them with generalized benefits available to all firms. These benefits will enable all firms to carry forward their losses for five years and have the option of claiming accelerated depreciation, based on broad classes of assets. As soon as these benefits are in place, the BOI will cease granting income tax holidays to newly registered enterprises, and will provide duty reduction and other fiscal incentives only to industries that are (i) exporting, (ii) have export potential based on objective Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - ATTACHMENT II ANNEX quantitative indicators, or (iii) undergoing industrial adjustment, owing, for example, to a reduction in tariff protection.

Outstanding reserve-eligible securities will include deposit money banks’ total holdings of reserve-eligible securities, whether or not they are needed to meet required reserve ratios. The aggregate reserve deficiency is defined as the amount by which aggregate required reserves against deposits and deposit substitutes exceed the sum of banks’ cash, reserve balances at the BSP, liquidity reserves, and reserve-eligible securities, as defined above. Adjustments The base money limits will be increased (decreased) for any increase (decrease) in required reserve ratios against deposits and deposit substitutes from the ratios in effect on July 1, 1995. The new base money limits will be calculated on the basis of the level of deposits and deposit substitutes projected for each test date. Provided that inflation remains on track, the limits will be increased by the excess of actual net international reserves (NJR) over the program floor, translate into pesos at the average exchange rate prevailing in the month concerned. However, if year-on-year consumer price inflation in the previous month exceeds the programmed rate (indicated below) by 1 percentage point or more, the adjustor will be capped at the previous month’s level. Reporting Developments in base money, including its key components, will be reported to the Fund upon availability, and in any case no later than three weeks after the end of each month. Reserve money will be reported daily, reserves against Common Trust Funds monthly, and broad money (M3) monthly upon availability.

Net foreign borrowing of the public sector will be measured as the difference between gross disbursements on borrowings of all maturities, including those of less than one year, and actual principal repayments, converted from the currencies borrowed into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction and subsequently from dollars into pesos using the average dollar/peso exchange rate for the month. The actual principal repayments include peso deposits made to blocked accounts at the BSP relating to rescheduled maturities. The PSBR will not be affected by any assumption by the National Government of pre- existing stock of liabilities as part of a privatization sale. These liabilities will not be included in the national government foreign or domestic liabilities, but will be reported separately; a similar treatment will apply, if necessary, to the privatization of subsidiaries of the 14 monitored corporations. Upon completion of any privatization sale, the enterprise concerned (or its subsidiary) will be removed from the coverage of the public sector. Any bills issued in the form of obligations sold at a discount to face value will be treated as follows: at the time of sale the face value shall be recorded as financing (below the line) and the discount recorded as interest expenditure (above the line), while at the time of redemption the face value shall be recorded as amortization. Blocked accounts The authorities will ensure that both the National Government and the 14 monitored corporations will pay into blocked accounts with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas the peso equivalent of rescheduled interest and principal payments on external debt and will ensure that all relevant central bank circulars to this effect are re-issued. As indicated earlier, rescheduled interest payments, including those allocated with the transferred liabilities of the PNB, DBP, PNPP, NDC, and Philguarantee, that are not accompanied by such counterpart deposits will, for purposes of measuring the PSBR, be treated as paid in cash according to the original maturity.

Subsequent changes in the dollar amounts of these items will be converted into pesos at the exchange rates at which transactions take place. Existing stocks will not be revalued for exchange rate changes. Similarly, within the Treasury IMP account, the quota will not be revalued from its value of December 3 1, 1994; changes in the quota will be converted into pesos at the peso/SDR exchange rate on the transaction date. Reporting Data on the PSBR and indicative benchmarks and ceiling dates will be reported by thee monetary authority for the purpose of monitoring ceilings within eight weeks after the reference date. Subsequently, the reported data will be reconciled with the corresponding data submitted by the National Government and the 14 corporations. In particular, data on external financing of the 14 monitored corporations will be obtained from the monetary authority, while data on nonbank financing and net lending and equity will be obtained from the Bureau of the Treasury, and the monitored government corporations.

Net banking system credit is the difference between any OPSF borrowing from banks and OPSF gross balances with banks. Net nonbank credit is the difference between outstanding reimbursement claims and any nonbank assets of the OPSF, such as investment in government securities. The balance excludes net unfiled claims, as well as accrued contributions, and assumes no substantial change in the timing of oil companies’ filing of claims against the OPSF. The OPSF fk~~halance, as included in the public sector borrowing requirement, is defined as the difference between the cumulative OPSF balance on December 31, 1994 and that on the test date. Adjustment The floors on the OPSF cumulative balance will be adjusted upward for any transfers received by the OPSF from the National Government after December 31, 1994.
