Introduction A staff mission visited Port Moresby during the period August 25-September 7, 1994 to conduct the 1994 Article IV consultation discussions. Subsequently, at the request of the authorities, further discussions were held in Port Moresby between October 1994 and June 1995 to complete the Article IV discussions and to discuss a possible stand-by arrangement from the Fund.’ In the attached letter and Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) (Annex I), the authorities request an 18-month stand-by arrangement in the amount of SDR 71.48 million (75 percent of quota) to support their economic reform program. Papua New Guinea has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. In completing the 1993 Article IV consultation discussions on December 6, 1993, Executive Directors noted Papua New Guinea’s strong growth performance, owing in large part to the strength of the mining sector and a low level of inflation. However, the conditions for broad-based sustainable growth had yet to be fully established. On the macroeconomic side, the fiscal position should be brought under firmer control through more effective expenditure control and the introduction of a national sales tax; over the medium term, the deficit should be set on a decisive downward path to permit a reduction in domestic financing without recourse to foreign commercial borrowing. Directors underlined the importance of structural measures, including a firm wage policy; removal of protective bans and quotas and the reduction of protective tariff rates; and the phasing out of price supports for tree crops. They also underlined the need to manage Papua New Guinea’s natural resources, especially in the forestry sector, in a sustainable fashion. Papua New Guinea’s statistical base is weak, particularly relating to the national accounts and the balance of payments.* The timeliness and completeness of data reporting has also been a continuing concern. During the discussions, the staff underscored the importance of improvements in these areas. Technical assistance is being provided in the areas of national ‘Additional missions took place during October 25November 11, 1994, January 24- February 9, 1995, March 28-April21, 1995, and May 29-June 2, 1995. The missions met with Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan, Finance Minister Haiveta, Finance Secretary Aopi, central bank Governors Morauta and Tarata, and other senior government officials and representatives of the private sector. Mr. Saito, Mr. Robinson, Ms. Rojas-Suarez, Mr. Kim, Mr. Callen, and Ms. Dayal-Gulati (all SEA), Mr. Fisher (PDR), Ms. Murrell (Administrative Offricer, CTA), Ms. Bright (Administrative Assistant, SEA), and Ms. Edwards (Administrative Assistant, PDR), took part in at least one of these missions; Mr. Waterman, Executive Director for Papua New Guinea, also participated in the discussions in September 1994 and in April 1995, *See Annex VII Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- accounts and balance of payments statistics, and there has been some improvement in data reporting, although it needs to be strengthened further. II. Background The economy of Papua New Guinea is dual in nature, with 80 percent of the population engaged in subsistence or small-scale agriculture, primarily coffee, cocoa, palm oil, and copra. The formal economy is dominated by a technologically advanced enclave mineral industry and government and other services; the manufacturing sector is smah and highly protected. Since independence in 1975, real GDP growth has averaged 3 percent, about 3/4 percent in per capita terms; obstacles to development include the rugged and fragmented topography, inadequate infrastructure, and high domestic costs, especially wages. While per capita income averages $1,130, significant disparities exist with income for the rural population well below this level. This has led to population drift to the cities, contributing to substantial urban unemployment and to law and order problems. During much of the 1980s macroeconomic management was cautious, resulting in relatively low inflation, a moderate external current account deficit, and a comfortable level of gross international reserves (Chart 1). However, a sharp decline in commodity prices at the end of the decade, combined with the crisis in Bougainville,3 led to a recession in 1989-90 and growing internal and external imbalances, In response, the authorities undertook an adjustment program supported by arrangements with the Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). While this contributed to stabilizing the external situation, the underlying deterioration in the fiscal position was not fully addressed; moreover, there were also slippages in implementing structural reforms. Since 1991, booming mineral sector activity--driven by the development of the Porgera gold mine and Kutubu oil field--has led to a period of rapid economic growth, supported latterly by agriculture and forestry (Table 1). While the surge in activity generated rapid growth in mining exports and revenues, it was--almost paradoxically--accompanied by a steady deterioration in the overall balance of payments position. This was mainly due to an expansionary budgetary stance caused by tax reductions and expenditure increases designed to foster nonmineral GDP growth, combined with persistent expenditure overruns. During 1992 and 1993, the fiscal deficit increased to an average of 5 3/4 percent of GDP (Table 2) much of which was financed domestically. Given the fixed exchange rate, the openness of the economy, and the accommodating monetary stance, the fiscal expansion resulted in a deterioration of the balance of payments rather than in higher inflation. Although the current account was in significant surplus, this 3A secessionist rebellion in 1989 resulted in the closure of the Bougainville mine and the loss of a substantial proportion of agricultural output and government revenue.

In contrast, despite a rapid .increase in log exports, the nonmineral sector ran a substantial current account deficit, which was compounded--particularly in 1993--by substantial capital outflows. Overall, the balan’ce of payments surplus in the mineral sector was more than offset by the deficit in the nonmineral sector, resulting in a steady loss of reserves. By end-1993, usable gross international reserves had fallen to $40 million (l/2 month of nonmineral imports).4 III. Ekonomic Developments During 1994 and Early 1995 During the first half of 1994, macroeconomic: imbalances grew further. The budget deficit. increased to 11 percent of GDP (at an annual rate) in the year to June, notwithstanding a minibudget in March.’ The deterioration in the fiscal position was a result of continued difficulties in expenditure control, substantial expenditure overruns related to Bougainville, commodity price supports and wages, as well as the payment of a number of large lumpy items. Together with the repayment of outstanding obligations from 1993, this overrun resulted in a sharp jump in net credit to government, and although private credit demand was stagnant, monetary growth rose sharply, while interest rates declined. The impact on the balance of payments was offset through $150 million of foreign borrowing,6 some of which was securitized, and about $100 million of short-term foreign exchange swaps and forwards with domestic commercial banks. Balance of payments pressures intensitied in July and August despite a further increase of $40 million in swaps and forwards with domestic banks and the introduction of a package of emergency measures designed to restrain government expenditure by controlling cash payments and prioritizing them in line with available budgetary funds, and suspending central bank financing of the budget. By early September, gross international reserves were almost completely exhausted and the authorities devalued the kina by 12 percent on September 12. The devaluation was accompanied by a l/4 percent increase in the discount rate. However, despite the advance payment of three months of budgetary aid by the Australian Government, these measures proved insufficient to stem the pressures on the kina and, in early October, 4Reported gross international reserves were considerably higher, since they included a $100 million escrow deposit. 5The minibudget included K 135 million (2 l/2 percent of GDP) of new measures, with K 54 million in expenditure cuts, concentrated on transportation and local government, and K 8 1 million in revenue measures, including higher taxes on log exports, imports, and fuels, and an increase in the top marginal rate of income tax (although this was more than offset by an adjustment in the bands favoring lower-income earners). 6These comprised a $63 million swap with the Reserve Bank of Australia, and a $90 million loan (secured against future mining revenues) from a syndicate of commercial banks.

On October 10, the kina was floated, with the exchange rate determined in a twice daily “open-outcry” auction.’ At the same time, the central bank announced a phased increase in the Minimum Liquid Asset Ratio (MLAR) from 11 percent to 26 percent, the suspension of the discount facility, and the enhanced enforcement of foreign exchange controls. The float of the kina was accompanied by a substantial tightening of financial policies which--after an initial further depreciation of 10 percent--contributed to some rebound in the value of the kina during the remainder of the year. Most importantly, the deterioration in the fiscal position was reversed by the emergency measures introduced to control expenditures which resulted in a sharp reduction in investment and outlays for essential services, by higher commodity prices (which, with the depreciation, obviated the need for commodity price support payments), higher-than-expected mining revenues, and the sale of the Government’s preference shares in the Ok Tedi mine. As a result, the deficit for 1994 as a whole was held to 2 l/4 percent of GDP, below the original budget target. With strict control of cash payments, net credit from the banking system dropped sharply; however, this came at the cost of a substantial buildup in domestic arrears (to a peak of 4 percent of GDP by mid-December).* As a result of the increase in the MLAR and the more aggressive sale of government paper, interest rates on six-month government paper increased to 10 3/4 percent by the end of the year. Broad money declined sharply, fully offsetting the rapid expansion in the first six months of the year. The difficulties of the economic situation in 1994 were compounded by volcanic eruptions in mid-September in Rabaul, one of the largest towns and commercial centers in the country. While loss of life was small, the eruption caused extensive damage, and rendered over 50,000 people homeless. Together with the tightening of financial policies, this contributed to a slowdown in activity in the second half of the year. For 1994 as a whole, real GDP growth is estimated at 3 percent as strong nonmining growth offset a fall in mining output; reflecting the depreciation of the kina in the last quarter, inflation picked up to 6 l/2 percent in the 12 months to December 1994. On the external side, despite the difftcult cash flow position, the authorities paid swaps and forwards from the reserves as they came due. Even so, gross usable international reserves rose to $66 million in the last quarter, boosted by the higher mining revenues and asset sales, as well as a $15 million swap with the Reserve Bank of Australia. The overall balance remained broadly constant for the year as a ‘Details of the operation of the auction system are set out in Annex II 8The actual buildup of arrears during the year as a whole was smaller, since some unpaid bills were carried over from 1993, and some repayments were made in the last two weeks of December. The bulk of these arrears took the form of unpaid checks to suppliers which-- since budgetary expenditures are recorded on a “checks-written” basis--constitute a financing item in the budget. A detailed discussion is included in the Statistical Appendix.

During the first quarter of 1995, expenditure control has remained very tight, reflected, inter alia, in very low investment outlays, while revenues have slightly exceeded projections, resulting in a budgetary surplus of 1 l/4 percent of GDP. Even so, net credit to the Government increased sharply as a result of the authorities’ decision to repay the outstanding domestic arrears by mid-January, financed largely through borrowing from the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG). The authorities viewed rapid repayment as essential to restore business and public confidence. To offset the expansionary implications, the MLAR was increased in early March from 26 percent to 29 percent, and to 32 percent in May, together with a further increase in interest rates (to about 15 percent). Despite the repayment of arrears, and the seasonal weakness in export receipts, the kina remained relatively stable during the first quarter. While in part due to the underlying tightness of financial policies, particularly on the fiscal side, this also reflected a substantial injection of foreign exchange by the BPNG into the market, mainly through the liquidation of outstanding forward contracts with commercial banks. From late March, however, the kina came under increasing pressure, resulting in a steady depreciation (to K 1=$0.78 by mid-May (Chart 2), and in the emergence of unsatisfied excess demand (Section 1V.D and Annex II). The continuing repayment of forwards, together with ,outstanding swap obligations and debt- service payments, resulted in a sharp decline in the usable reserves of the BPNG, which by end-.4pril had once again fallen to very low levels. IV. The 1995 Program The main objectives of the 1995-96 economic and financial program are to restore economic and financial stability and to encourage strong, broadly based, and sustainable economic growth. To this end, the authorities aim to restrain CPI inflation to 14 percent in 1995 and to reduce it to 5 percent in 1996; to achieve an $80 million increase in gross international reserves to $176 million (2 months of nonmineral imports) in 1995, and to $300 million (3 l/4 months of nonmineral imports) in 1996; and to limit to the extent possible the negative effect of the adjustment on economic activity. To achieve these objectives, the program envisages a reduction in the fiscal deficit to 1 percent of GDP, including a substantial shift From current to capital expenditures, supported by tight monetary and wages policies, to contain inflation and help maintain exchange rate stability. Macroeconomic stabilization measures will be accompanied by structural reforms, which it is expected will be supported by an Economic Recovery Loan under discussion with the World Bank, designed to promote private sector activity and lay the foundation for sustained and sustainable economic growth. The adjustment program will have important social implications. The primary burden of adjustment is likely to be borne by the urban population, owing to the combination of wage restraint and the higher cost of imported staples. It should be noted, however, that this group is relatively well off and benefited significantly from the tax reductions in recent years.

Lower real wages should also, with some lag, help to reduce the high level of urban employment. A. Real Sector Real GDP is expected to decline by 4 3/4 percent in 1995 and to pick up by l/2 percent in 1996 (Table 1). These developments, however, are heavily influenced by the projected sharp reduction in mineral sector activity owing to declining production from the Porgera gold mine and the Kutubu oil field. Growth in nonmineral GDP, which has a more direct impact on the living standards of the bulk of the population, is expected to fall to about 1 percent in 1995 as the positive impact of higher commodity prices and the depreciation of the kina are offset by reduced activity in domestic-demand sensitive sectors, but to rebound to 4 l/2 percent in 1996 aided by the full-year effect of construction of the Lihir gold mine and the Gobe oil field.’ CPI inflation is expected to remain high during the first quarter of 1995, mainly reflecting the lagged impact of the earlier depreciation of the kina. The authorities agreed that to contain inflation during the remainder of the year, it will be essential that exchange market stability be restored and the second round effects of the kina depreciation be minimized. While, in the short term, downward pressures on the exchange rate are likely to persist (Section IV.D), this should be reversed thereafter due to the combination of continued tight financial and wage policies, as well as a seasonal pickup in exports and the elimination of demand pressures resulting from the repayment of domestic arrears. This would permit a reduction in inflationary pressures during the second half of the year, laying the foundation for a reduction in inflation to 5 percent in 1996. B. Fiscal Policy The authorities underscored that the centerpiece of economic adjustment under the program is a reduction in the fiscal deficit from 2 l/4 percent of GDP in 1994 to 1 percent of GDP in 1995l’ (Table 2 and Chart 3). Given the projected reduction in mining revenues, and’ allowing for a major shift from current to capital expenditures, this implies an underlying ‘Construction of the Lihir gold mine is expected to begin in the third quarter of 1995. The $700 million project will be financed through a $400 million equity float and $300 million of debt. Construction of the Gobe oil field is expected to begin in late 199Uearly 1996. “Excluding asset sales, the deficit would fall from 3 percent of GDP to I 3/4 percent of GDP.

The reduction in the deficit, together with program aid from multilateral and bilateral sources and higher project aid associated with the increase in public investment, will permit a reduction in net domestic financing to 3/4 percent of GDP, about one fifth of the 1994 level. However, net credit to the Government is expected to increase sharply owing to the repayment of domestic arrears. To achieve the proposed fiscal adjustment, the November Supply Bill’* and the March expenditure budget included a combination of revenue and expenditure measures, as well as additional asset sales. In the November Supply Bill, K 65 million (1 percent of GDP) of new revenue measures were introduced, including the elimination of income tax exemptions for fringe benefits; raising the protective rate of import duty from 33 percent to 40 percent; increasing excise duties on alcohol and tobacco; higher fees and charges; and improved tax administration, especially through better surveillance of log exports (paragraphs 9 and 10, MEFP). Asset sales, primarily of the Government’s share in mineral companies, were targeted at K 50 million (0.8 percent of GDP), slightly higher than in 1994, while foreign grants were expected to remain broadly constant as a percentage of GDP. Nevertheless, with a projected decline of 1 l/2 percent of GDP in mining revenues, as well as the lack of buoyancy of some taxes, total revenues and grants are projected to decline by 3/4 percent of GDP to 26 percent of GDP in 1995. Current expenditures, which have been subject to substantial overruns in the past, are projected to fall by 4 l/4 percent of GDP to 22 percent of GDP. Within this, the wage bill is to be reduced by 1 l/2 percent of GDP by limiting the increase in public sector wages to 3 percent, reducing excess employment in provincial departments, and by the initiation of civil service restructuring (see below). Notwithstanding higher domestic interest payments, nonwage current expenditures are to be reduced by 2 3/4 percent of GDP (paragraphs 12 and 13, MEFP), including through a sharp cut in defense expenditure (halved to 1 percent of GDP, partly reflecting the improved security situation in Bougainville); lower price support payments reflecting higher commodity prices and the depreciation of the kina (314 percent of GDP); and by a reduction in transfers to provincial governments and statutory authorities (1 percent of GDP). There is also to be a shift in current expenditures toward greater provision of basic government services, including primary and secondary education, primary health and hospital services, and agricultural support services. The public investment program is projected to increase from 3 percent of GDP in 1994 to 5 percent of GDP, with substantial increases in outlays on transportation and communications and energy, and agriculture, as well as a sizeable allocation for reconstruction work: in Rabaul. While public investment would still remain low in relation to infrastructural “In terms of the balance between nonmining revenues and current expenditures. ‘“The authorities introduced a Supply Bill in November 1994 setting out revenue measures and appropriations for the first quarter of 1995.

With the help of the World Bank, the authorities are introducing a series of measures to improve project implementation including simplification and streamlining of disbursement procedures; permitting imprest accounts and direct donor financing of aid projects; and abolition of parliamentary approval requirements for public work projects exceeding K 200,000. In contrast to past practice, departments will not now be permitted to cover overruns on current outlays by reducing investment expenditure. While the staff generally supported the framework and measures included in the 1995 budget, it noted that the targets could prove dificult to achieve even though budgeted expenditures on price supports are not expected to be required, and projections of mining revenues were likely to prove conservative in light of recent increases in oil prices. In particular, owing to recent complications in the sale of RoadCo to the Ok Tedi mine, it was unclear how the K 50 million of asset sales would be achieved. Moreover, there were risks of expenditure overruns in a number of areas, particularly defense, whose appropriation was reduced by more than 50 percent in real terms and which has been subject to perennial overruns in the past; in debt service, given higher-than-budgeted domestic interest rates and the depreciation of the kina (especially against the yen); and in wages and salaries, as savings from civil service restructuring may not fully materialize in 1995. The authorities stressed their determination to meet the budgetary targets, underlining the recent improvement in expenditure control, but agreed that risks remained. Given the difficulties with RoadCo, they intend to move ahead rapidly with the sale of 5 percent of the Government’s share in the Porgera gold mine to the landowners and the Enga Provincial Government, financed by offshore borrowing (paragraph 11, MEFP) and to divest their shares in Ramu Sugar, which could in total raise K 45 million. In addition, they intend to delay K 15 million of expenditures on Jackson Airport and the Poreporena Freeway until the fourth quarter of 1995, and to defer them if sufficient funds are not available; and to collect at least K 25 million in coffee levies and associated STABEX funding, which have not been included in the budget. The latter will provide an additional safety margin; if not required, there would be scope for additional credit extension to the private sector. The 1995 budget includes structural reforms on both the revenue and expenditure side. With the assistance of the World Bank, the authorities are presently reviewing the export tax system on logs, with a view to introducing a variable levy system in 1996. They also intend to review the tariff system to reduce the level and dispersion of the tariff bands in 1996 and beyond, in conjunction with the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax in 1996-97 (for which Fund technical assistance has been requested).13 The authorities have also embarked on a major public service reform, with the twin aims of improving service delivery and reducing public employment by 7 l/2 percent over the next 18 months (paragraph 20, 13This would likely be in parallel with the existing provincial government sales tax, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- MEFP). Expenditure control has also been strengthened further through the introduction of monthly controls on warrant issues (paragraph 16, MEFP). The authorities intend to maintain a tight fiscal stance in 1996, with the overall deficit maintained at about 1 percent of GDP. This will be more than covered by foreign financing, including higher concessional loan disbursements as well as program aid, permitting substantial repayment of borrowing from the banking system. Revenue and grants are targeted to remain at 26 percent of GDP and expenditures at 27 percent of GDP, with an increase in public investment offset by lower current expenditures. The mission expressed concern at the impact of recently announced reductions in mining taxes to take effect in 1996 (l/2 percent of GDP)i4 and possible expenditures related to the proposed reform of provincial and local governments (l/2 percent of GDP in 1996, and more thereafter).” The authorities indicated that the revenue outlook would be reassessed nearer the time, taking into account the impact of the tax reforms described above, and additional measures taken as necessary. While the financial implications of provincial and local government reform have yet to be fully assessed, any expenditures in 1995 would be offset by cuts elsewhere; thereafter, the reforms would be implemented at a pace consistent with available resources. The authorities underlined their determination to maintain tight control over current outlays (whose growth will be held to about 3 percent) through a strict wage policy, completion of the public service restructuring, and stringent control of less essential expenditures, including transfers to statutory authorities, C. Monetary Policy The interpretation of recent monetary developments, and with it the design of a monetary program for 1995, is complicated by a number of special factors including the buildup and subsequent repayment of domestic arrears. While it is diflicult to untangle the effects with certainty, developments during the first quarter of 1995--during which much of the adjustment is likely to have been completed--suggest that the arrears repayment was reflected primarily in a combination of higher import demand and repayment of outstanding 141n addition, the Mineral Resource Development Corporation’s (MRDC ) resources were used to finance the purchase of the Government’s share in Lihir; these t?mds would otherwise have been transferred to the budget. “Transfers to provincial governments could increase by at least 1 l/2 percent of GDP from 1997 onward (paragraph 2 1, MEFP), although there may be some offsetting savings in other parts of the budget. A discussion of the proposed reforms of provincial and local governments is attached to the forthcoming Statistical Appendix.

Given the slow growth in the first quarter, this allows an increase of 12 l/4 percent during the last three quarters of the year implying some rebound in real money demand reflecting lagged adjustment to the increase in the CPI during the previous six months. Monetary growth is targeted at 12 percent in 1996, implying some decline in velocity in response to lower inflatic as well as a gradual restoration of confidence. on Given the targeted increase in net international reserves, and the repayment of swaps to domestic commercial banks, net domestic assets are programmed to increase by 11 3/4 percent in 1995. Within this, the increase in net credit to the consolidated central government is projected at K 129 million (entirely accounted for by repayment of arrears). While private sector credit growth is limited to 5 l/2 percent for 1995 as a whole, this would--given the decline in the first quarter which was partly arrears related--result in an increase of 9 l/2 percent during the last three quarters. Private sector credit growth is expected to pick up to 12 l/4 percent in 1996, aided by the pickup in money demand and the projected repayment of net credit to the Government. Since October, monetary policy has been tightened significantly, reflected in a steady rise in interest rates on government paper, and--with some lag--on deposits and lending. Nevertheless, partly reflecting the impact of the repayment of arrears, the situation remains fragile, as the current pressures in the exchange market indicate. Against this background, the authorities indicated that they continue to closely monitor developments in monetary and credit aggregates and the exchange rate, and will take additional measures as necessary to ensure that the program targets can be met. At present, monetarv management is effected primarily through changes in the MLAR and by sales of government securities in the auction. However, the MLAR is a blunt and inefficient instrument. At the same time, while the BPNG no longer provides informal guidance on interest rate spreads to commercial banks, the transmission of changes in the treasury bill rate to other interest rates in the system is relatively weak, partly reflecting the concentration of treasury bills in commercial banks, and the thinness of domestic money markets. The move to a floating exchange rate reinforces the need to shift toward indirect instruments of monetary control. Against this background, and given their desire to return the MLAR to more normal levels as soon as possible, the authorities have requested technical assistance from the Fund in this area. i6Private sector credit fell sharply during the first quarter of 1995, although this was also due to the tightening of monetary conditions.

External Policies While the tightening of financial policies will lead to a marked improvement in the underlying external accounts, the effect in 1995 will be offset by higher external payments related to the settlement of domestic arrears, as well as repayment of swaps with domestic commercial banks.” As a result, the overall balance of pavments deficit is expected to remain broadly unchanged at $89 million. However, with the completion of these once-off transactions, as well as net inflows of funds associated with the Lihir gold mine project, the overall balance is expected to register a surplus of $30 million in 1996. Developments in the balance of payments in Papua New Guinea are heavily influenced by the mineral sector. While the external current account surplus is projected to decline from 10 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 to 4 percent of GDP in 1995, and to register a deficit of 6 l/2 percent of GDP in 1996 (Table 4 and Chart 4), this entirely reflects the combination of declining mineral exports and higher imports associated with construction of the Lihir gold mine and the Gobe oil field which are largely offset by higher direct investment and other capital inflows. In contrast, the nonmineral current account deficit, which is more closely related to underlying developments in the domestic economy, is expected to decline from 10 l/4 percent of GDP in 1994 to 9 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995, owing to the tightening of financial policies, partially offset by higher imports associated with the settlement of arrears and the increase in public investment. In 1996, this improvement is expected to be reversed, reflecting higher imports associated with the pickup in economic growth, tariff reform, and a further increase in public investment. The decline in Australian budgetary aid over the period is expected to be partially offset by an increase in project-related grants and STABEX grants of $18 million in both 1995 and 1996. While other concessional aid inflows are expected to increase sharply owing to higher public investment, these will be offset in 1995 by higher public sector debt repayments and repayment of swaps, and in 1996--to a lesser extent--by a buildup in banks’ holdings of foreign assets as transactions in the forward market return to more normal levels. A key aim of the program is to reconstitute gross official reserves in order to provide a buffer against fluctuations in the central bank’s cash flow and seasonal swings in export earnings, and to give some protection against terms of trade shocks and natural disasters. Accordingly, the program has targeted gross reserves to increase to $176 million (2 months of nonmineral imports) by end-1995 and further to $300 million (3 l/4 months of nonmineral “The latter will, however, be offset by the collapse in the forward market (Annex II) which allows banks to reduce their holdings of foreign assets, since they no longer need to hold foreign exchange to close their forward foreign exchange positions.

To this end, the program incorporates a cautious reserve management policy, including full reserve coverage of higher-than-programmed levels of foreign exchange swaps and forwards.” The Government intends to refrain from any ‘additional external commercial borrowing for balance of payments purposes during 1995-96 to provide a clear market for the project financing for Lihir and Gobe, and to permit international capital markets time to observe Papua New Guinea’s improving economic petformance.20 The proposed buildup in international reserves, together with the outlook for the balance of payments described above, implies external financing gans of $200 million in 1995, and $157 million in 1996. In 1995, it is anticipated that the external financing gap will be covered by the first three purchases under the proposed stand-by arrangement (SDR 33.34 million, about $50 million); foreign borrowing associated with the sale by the Central Government of a 5 percent equity stake in the Porgera gold mine ($25 million); and the voluntary rollover of reserve management swaps ($15 million). In addition, the authorities are discussing an Economic Recovery Loan with the World Bank ($30 million) and have requested bilateral assistance from Australia and parallel financing from JBXIM ($80 million). The 1996 financing gap is expected to be fully covered through a combination of the remaining purchases under the stand-by arrangement; parallel financing from JEXIM; a follow on World Bank program loan; and the first tranche of a program loan from the Asian Development Bank. The authorities felt, and the staff concurred, that the auction system introduced last October had, in general, provided a simple and transparent mechanism for determining the exchange rate. However, since trading can take place, and the market can close, before an equilibrium exchange rate has been reached, unsatisfied demand can remain at the closing rate. This has resulted in the emergence of queuing and--for the first time in Papua New Guinea-- ‘*The reserve figures reported by the BPNG include a blocked deposit held as security for foreign commercial borrowing of the Government. Usable reserves were $66 million at end-1994, and are targeted to increase to $15 1 million by end-l 995, and $275 million by end- 1996. 19To this end, the performance criterion on net international reserves of the BPNG is defined net of spot and forward liabilities to residents and nonresidents alike. 2oHowever, the program has made allowances for a public sector guarantee to cover the construction phase of the state’s 30 percent share of the proposed $300 million loan for the Lihir gold mine; parallel financing from the Export Import Bank of Japan (JEXIM); borrowing by a provincial government (jointly with land owners) to finance the purchase of equity in the Porgera gold mine; and normal commercial borrowing by statutory authorities and the MRDC.

While the authorities felt that the incidence of queuing was largely due to seasonal shortages of foreign exchange that should be reversed by end-July, as well as arrears repayments, they agreed that the structure of the market could give rise to inefficiencies. They, therefore, intend to introduce by end-July 1995 a fully functioning screen-based market in which prices are posted and transactions concluded by electronic communication (a structural performance criterion under the program). Given the thinness of the market, this will not necessarily eliminate queuing altogether, but it will permit the market to adjust more rapidly, as well as allowing more continuous and convenient trading. In the interim period, the authorities have increased the initial step in the auction from 5 to 10 basis points to permit the exchange rate to adjust more flexibly to underlying market conditions, especially in view of the recent move to one-a-day auctions (Annex II). Given the present low level of reserves, the staff underlined the need to avoid any intervention to support the rate. It also stressed the uncertainties regarding the market clearing level of the exchange rate which underscored the need to maintain confidence in the system through tight financial policies. The failure of the current auction market to clear, that is, to satisfjr the demand for foreign exchange by customers willing to pay an equilibrium price, gives rise to an exchange restriction and a multiple currency practice subject to the jurisdiction of the Fund. These restrictions were, however, introduced for balance of payments purposes, and are nondiscriminatory and temporary (they will be eliminated with the introduction of the screen- based system). Apart from this, there are no other restrictions on current account transactions. E. Structural Policies Although important progress has been made in recent years in wage reform and foreign exchange liberalization, Papua New Guinea continues to face substantial structural and institutional impediments to growth. The 1995 budget includes a range of initiatives, designed in conjunction with the World Bank, which constitute a first step in a program of reforms to improve the environment for private sector activity and to lay the basis for sustained growth over the medium term. The Government has announced a number of reforms of trade and investment policv designed to increase competition and encourage private sector investment. To this end, almost all import bans and quotas21 have been replaced with tariffs set at the current protective rate of 40 percent (some at 75 percent and 100 percent) (paragraph 34, MEFP). In collaboration with the World Bank, and subject to commitments under international agreements, the Government intends to reduce the level and dispersion of the major tariff bands in the 1996 budget, with the aim of moving to a low uniform duty rate for most goods over the medium term. It has also applied to join the WTO. To encourage foreign and 21Except for beef/lamb, which will be removed in the November 1995 budget, cement, sugar, and some restrictions maintained for health and security reasons.

In order to bring more land into productive use, legislation to allow the registration of customary land is being finalized, after which the Government intends to move rapidly to develop an effective land registration system. Reform of trade and investment will be accompanied by measures to restrain wages and liberalize prices. While it proved impossible to maintain a full freeze as originally intended, public sector wage growth will be limited I:O 3 percent in 1995, 1 l/2 percent of which1 was backdated to January 1, 1994, implying a substantial real wage cut. No fLrther increalse will be provided during the remainder of the year. To help contain wage pressures in the private sector, the authorities do not intend to permit any increase in the national minimum wage in 1995. With the exception of a few items with natural monopoly status, the Government intends to remove one third of price controls (which cover 45 percent of goods in the CPI) by August 1995 and the remainder by March 1996. Given the limited size of the domestic market, this will be done to the extent possible in conjunction with a reduction in domestic protection, to ensure that prices are set competitively. The agricultural sector., which supports some 80 percent of the population, is crucia.l to Palpua New Guinea’s long-term development. While agricultural price supports played am important role in maintaining the tree crop industry during the period of weak international commodity prices, they also discouraged diversification and contributed to the deterioration in the budgetary position. With the recovery in commodity prices and the depreciation of the kina, bounty payments have been eliminated for all crops, and levies introduced for coffee amd copra.22 On present projections, no tirther price support will be needed over the next two years:, the Government intends to reform the operations of the price support schemes by November 1997, at the latest, to allow them to operate without direct financial support. The sharp increase in loRging activity in recent years, as well as experience in some neighboring countries, has underlined the need to ensure that forestry resources are exploited on a sustainable basis. To this end, the authorities intend to bolster recent steps to improve surveillance of logging operators (for which initial results have been very encouraging) by ensuring that all current licensed operators hold production to existing levels and that all new licenses comply with sustainability criteria for <the forest areas involved. In addition, the replacement of the current flat rate export tax by a variable levy (increasing with world prices) will help ensure that the Government, landowners, and entrepreneurs receive an equitable return. In the mining sector, the authorities intend to float their equity share in the MRDC in 1996-97. The proceeds will be used to build up foreign assets, repay debt, or finance once-off costs of structural reforms, and not to finance current consumption. ‘*The Government is considering changes in the price support system, which would reduce the effective rate of levies (paragraph 38, MEFP).

Medium-Term Prospects The staffs medium-term scenario is predicated on the assumption that the authorities maintain tight financial policies to ensure that inflation is reduced to the level in trading partners in 1997 and beyond, supported by the continuation of the structural reforms begun in the context of the 1995 budget. On the fiscal side, the deficit is assumed to increase slowly to 2 l/4 percent of GDP by the end of the period, entirely accounted for by higher capital expenditures; aided by higher project aid and lower amortization payments, net domestic financing is assumed to be held to 1 percent of GDP over the medium term. On the external side, the terms of trade are expected to decline by 1 l/2 percent a year on average, mainly reflecting the fall in coffee prices from the current peak (Table 5). In the mining sector, construction of Lihir and Gobe are assumed to begin in 1995-96, and production to begin in 1997-98. No other major new developments are assumed over the projection period, and with output from Kutubu and Porgera falling further, mineral output and exports are expected to continue to decline until 1998. Nonmineral GDP growth is expected to dip to about 2 l/4 percent in 1997 as the construction of Lihir and Gobe comes to an end, before increasing steadily to 4 l/4 percent by the end of the period. The balance of payments will continue to be heavily influenced by developments in the mining sector (Table 6). After increasing in 1996, the mineral balance of payments surplus is expected to decline significantly in 1997-98 reflecting falling output and the completion of construction of the Lihir and Gobe projects,23 and thereafter to remain broadly constant in U.S. dollar terms. In contrast, the nonmineral balance of payments position is expected to improve steadily over the period. Within this, the nonmineral current account balance is projected to remain broadly constant as a percentage of GDP in 1996-97, but to strengthen thereafter as the effect of lower coffee prices and higher project-related imports are offset by a further pickup in log exports, and by export diversification and import substitution in response to the depreciation of the exchange rate and the implementation of structural reforms. At the same time, the nonmineral capital account should also move into surplus owing to declining public and private sector amortization payments, as well as to lower outflows from commercial banks.24 *‘The mineral balance of payments surplus is conceptually equal to the sum of the mineral sector’s tax and dividend payments, domestic expenditures, and purchases of domestic assets The construction of the Lihir and Gobe projects results in an improvement in the mining balance of payments since some domestic construction is externally financed. 24The buildup in commercial bank net foreign assets will be boosted in 1995-96 as a result of the rebuilding of the forward market.

Overall, the improvement in the nonmineral balance of payments deficit more than off:;ets the decline in the mineral sector surplus, resulting in small overall surpluses in 1996-97, and after a small deficit in 1998, a growing surplus thereafter. On the assumption that reserves are maintained at about 3-3 l/4 months of nonmining imports, external financing gaps will persist in 1996-98, but will be eliminated thereafter. 25 After increasing in 1996 and 1.997 (owing mainly to mining sector borrowing related to the Lihir and Gobe projects), the ex:ternal debt/GDP ratio is projected to decline steadily to 34 percent over the period; the debt-service ratio would decline to 14 percent. It must be stressed, however, that achievement of this outturn will depend importantly on firm policy implementation. Given the expected decline in mineral sector output and mineral tax revenues, as well as the shift in the composition of Australian aid from budgetary support to project grants, this implies a continuing underlying fiscal adjustment, requiring new measures of about 2 percent of GDP over the period; this could increase if the provincial government reforms are implemented in full. Together with the need to encourage export diversification, this underlines the need for the continued implementation of structural reforms, especially to broaden the tax base, restructure the public sector, improve project implementation, and strengthen trade and investment policies. Were this not to occur, there would be the possibility of a re-emergence of financing gaps toward the end of the decade, and consequent downward pressure on the exchange rate. B. Capacity to Repay and Risks to the Fund If the amounts under the proposed stand-by arrangement are fUy purchased, outstanding Fund credit would peak at SDR 71.48 million (75 percent of quota, or about 2 percent of GDP) at end- 1996, and gradually decline to zero by 2001 (Table 7). Gross Fund financing is expected to account for about 30 percent of total financing needs (about 35 percent of financing needs from official sources) during the program period. Debt service to the Fund would peak in 2000 at SDR 3 1 million, equivalent to 32 percent of quota or about 1 3/4 percent of exports of goods and services, before declining to 3/4 percent in 2001 (the last year of debt-service payments to the Fund). The ratio of Fund repurchases and charges to gross international reserves is projected to increase from about 1 l/2 percent in 1996 to 12 3/4 percent in 2000, before declining to about 5 percent in 2001 (Table 8). The proposed stand-by arrangement will entail some risk for the Fund. The medium- term balance of payments outlook depends critically on sustained implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reform. As noted above, Papua New Guinea will face continuing fiscal pressures over the medium term, stemming from declining mineral sector earnings and aid flows, as well as the possibility of higher-than-expected expenditures related to provincial and local government reform. Moreover, it remains vulnerable to natural 25The external position in 1996-97 will be strengthened by receipts from the flotation of MRDC, which--given the uncertainties--has not been included in the projections.

However, Papua New Guinea has been able to maintain orderly relations with creditors and has avoided rescheduling. There are at present no outstanding obligations to the Fund, debt service to the Fund will remain relatively low as a percentage of exports of goods and services, and Papua New Guinea’s record in making payments to the Fund is generally good. The authorities have also indicated that they would make every effort to continue to discharge their payments to the Fund on a timely basis, and will maintain close collaboration with the Fund (paragraph 6, MEFP). VI. Performance Criteria, Structural Benchmarks, and Reviews 26 Progress under the adjustment program and the appropriateness of policies will be monitored through quantitative and structural performance criteria, structural benchmarks, and indicative targets (Annex I, Tables 1 and 2). The performance criteria comprise (a) quarterly ceilings on net domestic assets of the banking system, including subceilings on net claims of the banking system on the central government and agricultural commodity stabilization fimds; (b) quarterly ceilings on the net domestic financing of the central government and agricultural stabilization funds; (c) quarterly floors on net international reserves of the BPNG; (d) ceilings on the cumulative contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external borrowing by the public sector in the maturities of l-15 years, including a sublimit on l-5 years’ maturity; (e) ceilings on the stock of public and publicly guaranteed short-term foreign debt (excluding normal import-related short-term credit); and (f) the standard trade and payments clause. In addition, three reviews of economic performance will be conducted by the Executive Board as conditions for the second, fourth, and sixth purchases (Table 9). The introduction of a screen-based foreign exchange system is a structural performance criterion; structural benchmarks have been set on price liberalization and the elimination of construction and manufacturing from reserved activities. In addition, there are indicative targets for the civil service wage bill, government expenditure, reserve money, and asset sales. The program includes two automatic adiustors to performance criteria in respect of unexpected developments in the external sector. To this end, the floors on net international reserves will be automatically increased by the full extent to which the cumulative receipts of the Mineral Resource Stabilization Fund (MRSF) revenues and balance of payments/ budgetary support (excluding the liabilities of the BPNG) exceed the targets.” Correspondingly, downward adjustments will be made to the ceilings for net domestic financing and net credit to the central government and agricultural stabilization funds. This will ensure that any unexpected improvement in mineral tax receipts (for instance, resulting 26Performance criteria have been set through December 1995; performance criteria for 1996 will be set at the second review.

Staff Appraisal Following three years of expansionary macroeconomic policies, Papua New Guinea experienced a serious economic crisis in September/October 1994, culminating in the almost complete exhaustion of usable reserves and the forced flotation of the kina. Since that time, the new Government has taken a number of important steps to address the economic situation. The fiscal position was brought into surplus, albeit through emergency measures, to restrain expenditures, while monetary policy has also been tightened significantly. Even so, the economic situation has remained very difficult, reflected in a steady decline in reserves and in the emergence of exchange market pressures in late March. While partly due to seasonal factors, this has also reflected the authorities’ decisions to repay domestic arrears rapidly and to meet swaps and forwards from reserves as they fell due. The 1995-96 program represents an ambitious attempt to combine macroeconomic stabilization with the structural reforms necessary to begin to reverse the stagnation in real per capita income that has persisted for so long. On the macroeconomic side, the program includes a sharp improvement in the fiscal deficit; a tightening of monetary policy; and strict wage restraint designed to achieve a sharp reduction in inflation during 1995 and to support the rebuilding of gross international reserves. This will be accompanied by a major shift from current to capital expenditures; public sector restructuring; strengthening of competition and economic incentives; and measures to promote sustainable economic development, especially in the forestry sector. The 1995 budget, together with the tightness of expenditure control in recent months, provides a welcome signal of the Government’s commitment to restore financial discipline, a prerequisite for the success of the program. However, the underlying fiscal adjustment envisaged under the program is ambitious; while the additional revenue and expenditure measures the authorities have implemented provide a welcome margin of safety, resolute expenditure control will be required to ensure that the budgetary targets are met. It will be especially important to resist any additional public sector wage claims, both in light of the fiscal implicationsand the effect on private sector wages and inflation. It will also be essential to move ahead rapidly with arrangements for the sale of a portion of the Government’s share in the Porgera gold mine. As the authorities well recognize, the projected decline in mineral revenues and in foreign budgetary support will lead to continued fiscal pressures during the remainder of the decade. For 1996, these problems will be exacerbated by the recent reductions in mining taxation, and by the possibility of significant additional expenditures related to provincial government reform. This underscores the need for continued restraint of nonpriority expenditures, including through the rapid implementation of the proposed civil service restructuring, and for measures to broaden the tax base, including the introduction of a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - national consumption tax (which will also facilitate the implementation of tariff reform). Provincial government reform must also be implemented at a pace consistent with available resources. Over the coming months, a key concern will be to limit the second-round impact of recent price increases to set inflation firmly on a downward trend during the second half of the year. This underscores the importance of restoring stability in the exchange market, both to limit direct pressures on inflation and to facilitate the maintenance of strict wage restraint. While pressure in the exchange market should ease as exports pick up and arrears repayments are completed, continued pressures are likely in the short term. During this period, close vigilance will be required, especially given the difficulties in interpreting monetary conditiorrs, and the authorities will need to stand ready to take additional measures as necessary. Given the move to a floating exchange rate, the development of indirect monetary instruments, to be supported by technical assistance from the Fund, takes on added importance. A central aim of the program is to rebuild gross international reserves to provide a buffer against fluctuations in exports, as we!! as protection against natural disasters and terms of trade shocks. In the immediate future, reserve management policy will need to be very cautious; in particular, any new forwards or swaps should be fully matched by higher reserves, and the authorities should avoid intervention in the market to support the exchange rate. Once reserves have been built up to more comfortable levels, there will be greater flexibility to manage seasonal fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, thus eliminating an important source of instability. The buildup in reserves, together with the projected balance of payments outlook, implies external financing gaps of $200 million in 1995, and $157 million in 1996. These gaps are expected to be covered by a combination of purchases under a stand-by arrangement from the Fund; drawings from multilateral agencies; support from bilateral creditors; rollover of swaps; and financing related to asset sales . The authorities do not intend to undertake additional external commercial borrowing, including securitized borrowing, for balance of payments purposes during the program period. The twice daily “open-outcry” auction for foreign exchange, introduced as a transitional measure, has generally operated in a satisfactory manner but, under certain circumstances, can give rise to queuing. The introduction of a continuous screen-based market by end-July 1995 will allow the market to clear expeditiously, permit more continuous and convenient trading, and eliminate the exchange restriction and multiple currency practice resulting from the present auction system. Since these restrictions were introduced for balance of payments reasons, and are nondiscriminatory and temporary, the staff recommends that temporary approval be granted until July 3 1, 1995. The structural measures,inc!uded in the program, in conjunction with the policies set out in the World Bank’s Economic Recovery Loan, constitute an important start in addressing obstacles to private sector development. As the authorities recognize--and as the medium- term projections underline--continued efforts will be needed over the medium term, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-35 - particularly in the areas of expenditure and tax policies, public administration, and trade and investment incentives. The staff welcomes the recent improvement in data reporting and urges that it be sustained and strengthened in the coming period. The staff encourages the authorities to intensify their efforts to improve the statistical base, especially the national accounts, consumer prices, and the balance of payments, including through the use of Fund technical assistance. The staff believes that the policies and measures set out in the Government’s MEFP will contribute significantly to the achievement of the short-term macroeconomic objectives of the program, while (in conjunction with the policies set out in the World Bank’s Economic Recovery Loan) constituting an important first step toward the structural reforms required to support growth over the medium term. Provided appropriate macroeconomic policies are maintained and structural reforms are implemented vigorously, the medium-term balance of payments is projected to remain viable and Papua New Guinea would be able to service its obligations to the Fund in a timely manner. The staff, therefore, recommends approval of Papua New Guinea’s request for a stand-by arrangement with the Fund for an amount equivalent to SDR 71.48 million (75 percent of quota). It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Proposed Decisions The following draft decisions are proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: A. 1995 Article IV Consultation 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Papua New Guinea’s exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, in the light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. The operation of the foreign exchange auction mechanism in Papua New Guinea gives rise to an exchange restriction on current international transactions and a multiple currency practice subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. The Fund notes the temporary nature of the restriction and the multiple currency practice and the authorities’ intention to eliminate them by end-July, 1995, and grants approval of the retention by Papua New Guinea of that restriction and multiple currency practice until July 3 1, 1995. B. Stand-By Arrangement 1. The Government of Papua New Guinea has requested a stand-by arrangement for a period of 18 months in an amount equivalent to SDR 71.48 million. 2.

Dear Mr. Camdessus: 1. Over the past three years, sustained expansionary fiscal policies have led to growing balance of payments pressures, culminating in September 1994 in the near exhaustion of gross international reserves followed shortly afterwards by the float of the kina. In response, the Government of Papua New Guinea has introduced a comprehensive stabilization and structural adjustment program designed to reduce the fiscal deficit; restrain inflation; restore exchange market stability; and lay the foundation for sustained economic growth. The attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies presents the objectives and policies that the Government of Papua New Guinea intends to pursue during 1995-96. To support this program, Papua New Guinea hereby requests an 18-month stand-by arrangement for the equivalent of SDR 7 1.48 million (75 percent of quota) with the Fund. 2. The Government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached Memorandum together with the observance of the performance criteria are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program. The Government is prepared to take any additional measures that may become necessary to achieve the aims of the program. The Papua New Guinea authorities will remain in close consultation with the Fund, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations, and will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requests in connection with assessing the implementation of policies and the progress made toward achieving the objectives of the program. In addition, we will complete comprehensive reviews of the program before September 15, 1995; February 15, 1996, and August 15, 1996. Sincerely yours, IS/ IS/ Koiari Tarata, I.S.O. Chris S.

Background and Recent Economic Developments 1. During the early 199Os, Papua New Guinea enjoyed a period of rapid economic growth driven by increased activity in the mining sector, and latterly by strong growth in agriculture and forestry. Inflation was kept at low levels, and progress was made in implementing structural reforms in the areas of wage policy and foreign exchange liberalization. Despite rapid growth in mineral exports and revenues, the overall financial situation deteriorated due to an expansionary fiscal stance. During 1992 and 1993, the overall fiscal deficit averaged 5 3/4 percent of GDP, above historical norms; in the first half of 1994, it surged to 11 percent of GDP on an annual basis For a period, the impact on the balance of payments, was offset through foreign borrowing, and through a buildup of foreign exchange swaps and forwards with domestic banks during 1994. By early September 1994 gross international reserves had fallen to unsustainably low levels. Despite a 12 percent devaluation of the kina, speculative pressures persisted, and in early October the Government decided to float the kina. 2. The float of the kina has been accompanied by a significant tightening of macroeconomic policies. This was reflected, inter alia, iin the relative stability of the kina (after an initial depreciation immediately following the float) during the remainder of 1994. Monetary policies, which had been accommodative, were tightened significantly through an increase in the Minimum Liquid Asset Ratio (MLAR) from 11 percent to 26 percent and more aggressive sales of government paper. Most importantly, a fiscal surplus was achieved during the second half of the year, resulting in a reduction in the overall deficit to 2.3 percent of GDP for 1994 as a whole. This improvement was achieved through emergency measures to restrain expenditures, which had a serious impact on investment outlays. The strict control on cash payments that was imposed also led to a large buildup of domestic arrears. 3. Between mid-December 1994 and late January 1995, the Government paid off the bulk of the outstanding stock of domestic arrears. This was financed largely by recourse to borrowing from the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG); to offset the expansionary impact, the MLAR was raised from 26 percent to 29 percent effective early March, and interest rates increased.. At the same time, fiscal policies have remained very tight (a surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP in the first three months of the year). Nevertheless, downward pressures appeared in late March in the foreign exchange market. At the same time, repayments of outstanding swaps and forwards and government debt-service payments have resulted in gross international reserves again dropping to very low levels.

The Government’s main economic objectives are to restore macroeconomic stability while encouraging strong, broadly based, and sustainable economic growth. In particular, it aims to achieve a reduction in inflation to the levels prevailing in its main trading partners; to rebuild international reserves to adequate levels; to maintain stability in the foreign exchange market; and to encourage private sector development and growth. To this end, its adjustment program is centered on a return to a conservative and responsible fiscal strategy; prudent monetary and credit policies, supported by strict restraint in public sector wage increases, and flexible interest rate and exchange rate policies. Macroeconomic stabilization will be supported by a program of structural reform designed to provide an environment in which the private sector can expand through rapid growth in private capita! investment, accompanied by a greater government commitment to the development of physical and social infrastructure. 5. The main objectives of the Government’s macroeconomic program are: (i) to restore financial stability and to restrain CPI inflation to 14 percent for 1995 as a whole and to 5 percent in 1996; (ii) to achieve an $80 million increase in gross international reserves to $176 million (2 months of nonmining imports) in 1995 and to $300 million (3.3 months of nonmining imports) in 1996; and (iii) to limit to the extent possible the negative effects on economic activity. Nonmining GDP growth is expected to fall to about 1 percent in 1995, and to rebound to about 4 l/2 percent in 1996, aided by the full-year effect of construction of the Lihir gold mine and the Gobe oil field. 6. This Government is committed to continue and maintain a sound macroeconomic framework, supported by active implementation of structural reforms in both the policy and administrative areas. It will collaborate very closely with the Fund and key multilateral donors; in this context, it intends to discuss with the Fund the possibility of a follow-up arrangement to the current stand-by, which could include an extended arrangement. Fiscal Policy 7. The Government’s adjustment program is centered on a further reduction in the fiscal deficit to restore financial stability and strengthen the external position. To this end, the Government’s 1995 budget targeted a deficit of 1 percent of GDP for the year as a whole, compared with 2.3 percent of GDP in 1994. Taking account of higher project and program aid disbursements, as we!! as exceptional financing from multilateral and bilateral creditors, a limit of K 49 million on net domestic financing has been set. 8. The reduction in the fiscal deficit will be accompanied by a very substantial shift from current to capita! expenditures. The 1995 budget has allowed for an increase of 2.2 percent of GDP in the Public Investment Program, which was severely reduced in 1994, with a substantial portion of the increase associated with the implementation of donor-assisted projects including the reconstruction of Rabau!. After allowing for the projected reduction in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - ANNEX1 ATTACHMENT mineral revenues, this will require a combination of revenue increases and current expenditure reductions totaling about 5 percent of GDP. Revenue 9. Total revenue and grants are budgeted at K 1,572 million (26.1 percent of GDP) in 1995, compared with K 1,447 million (26.8 percent of GDP) in 1994. The Supply Bill approved in November 1994 incorporated new revenue measures, estimated to yield K 65 million, and asset sales of K 50 million. The revenue measures include the elimination of tax exemptions for fringe benefits introduced in the 1993 budget (K 15 million); an increase in the protective import duty rate from 33 percent to 40 percent and upward adjustments of import duties for alcohol and tobacco (K 12 million); the application of customs duties to public sector imports (K 1 million in net terms); increases of lo-20 percent in excise duties on tobacco and cigarettes, together with the introduction of duties on selected alcohol (K 7.5 million); increases in fees and charges (K 15 million) and stamp duties on lotteries (K 2 million); and the strengthening of tax administration through the introduction of surveillance on log exports (K 7.5 million) and of compulsory preshipment inspection of imports (K 5 million). 10. The measures related to fringe benefits, excise taxes, and import duties were implemented by January 1, 1995. The proposed fees and charges for fishing and land use were implemented in March and the other new fees and charges were made effective as of May 1995. The implementation of full surveillance on log exports has been slower than expected, but initial results on revenue collection are encouraging: 3 1 inspection camps are expected to become operational by mid-1995, covering about 65 percent of total log exports. However, the implementation of compulsory preshipment inspection of imports has been postponed for the time being; the Government intends that this be introduced in 1996. In addition, the 1995 budget reduced custom duties on selected food items and construction materials by between 15 percentage points and 44 percentage points, with an estimated revenue loss of K 1.4 million; these revenue losses are expected to be offset by revenue gains from the tariffication of banned items. 11. The Government intends to move ahead rapidly with the sale of 5.1 percent of its equity stock in the Porgera gold mine to the landowners and the Enga Provincial Government, financed by offshore borrowing, which could raise K 35 million. To this end, it will (i) produce a pro forma financing plan by mid-May 1995; (ii) begin discussions with landowners and the provincial government by end-June 1995, and agree a Memorandum of Understanding by end-August 1995; and (iii) seek to fnalize the sale by October 1995. The Government will seek to raise the remaining K 15 million through the sale of RoadCo (which could net K 50 million) or by other asset sales. The Government also intends to give high priority to the audit and review of mining and petroleum taxes, and to efforts to strengthen recovery of land rental arrears. The Government will continue to closely monitor revenue developments and stands ready to take additional measures to meet the target if necessary.

The rapid expansion in current expenditure has been a principal factor responsible for the sharp deterioration in the fiscal position since 1990. The 1995 budget incorporates a major step to contain current expenditure to a sustainable level over the medium term. To this end, current expenditure is budgeted at K 1,321 million (21.9 percent of GDP) in 1995, a substantial decline from K 1,4 16 million (26.2 percent of GDP) in 1994. 13. Departmental appropriations for nonwage current expenditures and transfers are to be curtailed by K 94 million (1.6 percent of GDP). Major cuts are associated with the Prime Minister’s Office (K 16 million), including a reallocation of at least 50 percent of the Electoral Development Fund for investment and development projects; Finance and Planning (K 34 million), including a reduction in commodity price support and the District and Urban Development Scheme; Village Service and Provincial Affairs (K 8 million); Defense (K 43 million) on the basis of an improvement in the security situation in Bougainville; and provincial departments (K 6 million), partly reflecting a shift in administration of health services to the newly established Hospital Management Services. Departmental appropriations for salaries and wages are to be reduced by K 34 million (0.6 percent of GDP), through limiting the wage adjustment for public sector employees to 3 percent in 1995 (see paragraph 37) stringent control on wages and salary payments to provincial departments, and the initiation of the civil service retrenchment program that will result in a 7.5 percent reduction in staffing levels over the next 18 months. Transfers to provincial governments are to be reduced by K 13 million (0.2 percent of GDP) including deferral of appropriations for mining agreements to 1996; the impact will be partly offset by their ability to raise additional revenues following the upward adjustment of the ceiling on the provincial sales tax rate to 5 percent. Transfers to statutory authorities and net lending are to be kept broadly unchanged in nominal terms. These reductions are partly offset by a substantial increase in interest payments as a result of higher domestic interest rates and the increase in domestic debt in recent years. The composition of current expenditure appropriations has been reviewed in consultation with the World Bank. The budget does not include any appropriation for the cost of reform of the provincial and local government system in 1995. The Government will not undertake any additional expenditures in this area unless fully offset by cuts in other expenditure appropriations, or by additional revenue measures. 14. The budget incorporates a sharp increase in capital expenditure, from K 157 million in 1994 to K 309 million in 1995. Much of the budgeted increase is designed to support improvements in transportation and communications and investment in the energy, agricultural, and other sectors. The composition of the public sector investment program is being reviewed carefully in consultation with the World Bank, taking into account the economic return of individual projects and the need to promote balanced regional development in infrastructure. One half of the appropriation for the Electoral Development Fund (K 32.7 million) has been earmarked for investment programs and made subject to stricter eligibility criteria. A substantial portion of the budgeted increase in capital expenditure will be associated with the implementation of existing donor-assisted projects, A number of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 46 - ANNEX1 ATTACmNT steps are to be taken to facilitate disbursements of donor assistance and ensure the implementation of projects. These include the simp.lification and streamlining of project approval procedures, the abolition of the parliamentary approval requirement for public work projects costing more than K 200,000, and allowing imprest accounts and direct donor financing of aid projects to replace the current reimbursement system.. 15. The Government believes that the revenue and expenditure targets in the budget, while tight, are achievable. It recognizes, however, that there are risks of shortfalls of revenues (particularly in relation to asset sales) and of expenditure overruns in some areas, including defense, debt service, and public sector wages. These risks are expected to be partially mitigated by the prospect of higher-than-budgeted revenues from MRSF (due to the recent pickup in oil prices); and the likelihood that the K 10 million appropriation for commodity price support will not in fact be required. In addition, the Government intends to sell its preference shares in Ramu Sugar by end-July (K 10 million); and to delay K 15 million of domestically financed expenditures on the Poreporena Freeway and the Jackson Airport until the fourth quarter of 1995; in the event that sufficient resources were not available, these expenditures would be deferred. The Government will also collect coffee levies and drawdown associated STABEX debt-reduction finds (see paragraph 38 below) (at least K 25 million). While the Government intends to set these funds aside, thus permitting additional private sector credit extension, this would provide an additional safety margin. Expenditure Control 16. Expenditure control has been tightened since mid-1994 in response to the expenditure overruns in the first half of the year, which resulted in a significant improvement in the fiscal position in the second half. The expenditure control measures introduced in the second half of 1994 primarily focused on cash control. In January 1995, further expenditure control measures were introduced with a view to enhancing control over warrant issues. Under the new system, the total amount of warrants is determined monthly by the Department of Finance and Planning on the basis of the projected availability of budgetary funds and financing. Further measures will be undertaken during 1995, aided by technical assistance, including a review of the structure and organization of the Department of Finance and Planning with a view to strengthening its planning functions and expenditure control. At the same time, the current budget and accounting scheme will be reformed by end-1995 so as to permit a full separation of the recurrent and capital expenditures. 17. The Government intends to maintain a tight fiscal stance in 1996, with the overall deficit held to 1 percent of GDP. Total revenue and grants are targeted to remain around 26 percent of GDP. Within this, mining revenues are expected to increase slightly, following the repayment of the carried stake in Kutubu, but this will be partly offset by the recently announced reduction in mining taxation, as well as the use of dividend receipts from Kutubu to finance the Government’s share in the Lihir gold mine. Nonmining revenues are expected to increase, as higher import duties offset a reduction in nontax revenues owing to lower asset sales. The revenue outlook will be reassessed in the 1996 budget, taking into account Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 47 - ANNEX I ATTACHMENT proposed reforms in import and logging taxes; additional measures will be proposed to achieve the revenue target, if necessary. Total expenditures will be held to 27.1 percent of GDP, the same as in 1995. Current expenditure growth will be held to about 3 percent in 1996, aided by the maintenance of a tight wage policy, completion of the public service restructuring begun in 1995, and continued stringent control of less essential expenditures. Budgetary appropriations for the public sector investment program are targeted to increase further by 0.5 percent of GDP to 5.6 percent of GDP (6.7 percent of GDP including off- budget development expenditure). The overall deficit will be more than covered by foreign financing, including higher concessional loan disbursements and exceptional budgetary support, permitting substantial repayment of borrowing from the banking system. 18. The Government intends to undertake a public flotation of a proportion of the Government’s holding in the Mineral Resources Development Corporation in 1996. The receipts from this sale will be sterilized offshore; used to repay debt; or used to cover once-off costs related to structural reforms; it is not intended that they be used to finance current consumption. As part of its policy to improve the environment for private sector development and privatization, the Government will continue with its efforts to establish a stock exchange. As an initial step, stamp duties on share transactions have been lifted and conditions relating to the operation of unit trusts eased. Medium-Term Fiscal Outlook 19. The fiscal position is likely to remain under pressure over the medium term, as revenue from the mineral sector and budgetary grants are expected to decline significantly. Against this background, the Government intends to broaden the tax base and improve its buoyancy and efficiency. To this end, the Government intends to introduce a broad-based consumption tax (in the context of a reform of the tariff system) in 1996-97, and has requested technical assistance from the Fund. In the recently passed Organic Law, the right to levy sales taxes remains limited to provincial and local governments. The Government intends to put forward an Organic Law Amendment Bill to give the Government concurrent powers to introduce a national sales and services tax. 20. On the expenditure side, a central element of the Government’s adjustment program is a restructuring and reduction of the public sector. In the 1995 Expenditure Budget, the Government announced that public sector employment would be reduced by 4,500 people. One third of this reduction is to be met by not filling approved and fimded positions, but 3,000 staff will be retrenched. This retrenchment program, which is being discussed with the World Bank, will be conducted over an l8-month period. The details of the retrenchment package are currently under discussion with the Public Employees Association, and will be announced by end-July 1995. The Government intends to spread the redundancy payments (estimated at about K 45 million) over a three-year period. Payments in 1995 will not exceed the K 12 million allocated in the budget. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 48 - ANNEX1 ATTACHMENT 21. Following the recommendations of the Constitutional Review Committee, Parliament has recently passed legislation for a new system of provincial and local government designed to decentralize powers and resources to the level of local and village-based governments, with the aim of improving service delivery to the rural population. The new system will become fully operational following the general election in 1997, although transitional arrangements are likely to take effect from the middle of 1995. To help improve service delivery in the rural areas, there will be a redistribution of the public service away from the center and into the provinces, although all public servants will come under the control of the relevant National department. While the final details of the reforms are still under discussion, the restructuring costs could amount to K 20 million in 1995 and to K 40 million per year during 1996-98; in addition, transfers from the national government budget to the provinces are expected to increase by at least K 100 million per year (based on 1994 figures). The Government is committed to ensuring that any costs incurred in 1995 related to the restructuring will be offset fUy by expenditure reductions elsewhere in the budget. In 1996 and beyond, the reforms are expected to be financed through cuts in other government expenditures (including civil service restructuring), as well as through measures to broaden the tax base. Beyond this, the Government will ensure that the pace at which the reforms are implemented is consistent with available resources in the context of a continued tight fiscal policy. Monetary Policy 22. The principal objectives of monetary policy will be to maintain financial stability and a level of broad money consistent with the targets for nonmining GDP growth and inflation. The formulation of the financial program for 1995 has taken into account the impact of the repayment of domestic arrears. (During 1994, the increase in domestic arrears was partly offset by a drawdown in deposits and by increased credits to suppliers.) Broad money is projected to grow by 13 l/2 percent in 1995; this would be consistent with some increase in velocity, reflecting the higher level of inflation. 23. Given the targeted increase in net foreign assets, net domestic assets are projected to increase by K 184 million (1 I .9 percent) in 1995. Within this, the increase in net credit to the Government and the price stabilization funds will be limited to K 129 million (including a K 10 million STABEX counterpart deposit), with the bulk of the expansion expected to occur in the first quarter of 1995, related to the repayment of domestic arrears. This will permit credit to the private sector (excluding price support) to grow by 5.5 percent for the year, and--given the decline in the first quarter--9 l/2 percent between March and December 1995. On the basis of these annual projections, quarterly limits have been set on net domestic assets of the banking system, with subceilings on net credit to the Government and the price stabilization funds. In addition, consistent with key aggregates of the monetary survey, an indicative program has been established for the stock of reserve money in the central bank’s balance sheet, which will be monitored on a monthly basis. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 49 - ANNEX1 ATTACHMENT Conduct of Monetary Policy 24. Despite the recent tightening of monetary policy in early March, continued vigilance remains necessary, especially given recent pressures in the exchange market. Against this background, in May 1995 the Government increased interest rates on six-month government paper to 15 percent and increased the MLAR by a t?n-ther 3 percent to 32 percent. The central bank will continue to closely monitor developments in key monetary and credit aggregates and the exchange rate, and take additional measures as necessary to ensure that the monetary and credit targets can be met. Such measures would include the sterilization of excess bank liquidity through increased sales of government securities (with an associated increase in the rate of return) and, if necessary, a further increase in the MLAR. Changes in interest rates will continue to constitute a principal channel through which changes in monetary policy are transmitted. Since October 1994, the BPNG no longer provides guidance to banks on the appropriateness of the spread between lending and deposit rates. Development of Indirect Monetary Instruments 25. At present, monetary management is effected primarily through changes in the MLAR and sales of government securities through the auction. However, the MLAR is a blunt and inefficient instrument; moreover, the transmission of treasury bill rates established in the auctions to other interest rates is relatively weak, partly because the instrument does not have a direct impact on the cost of funds. The introduction of a floating exchange rate has reinforced the need to strengthen instruments of monetary control. In this context, the Government has requested technical assistance from the Fund to develop a program of reforms designed (i) to permit a steady reduction in reliance on the MLAR and a shift toward greater use of indirect monetary instruments, and (ii) to develop primary and secondary money and securities markets. Since January 1995, the BPNG has been limiting temporary advances to an agreed level of expenditures, with government receipts placed in a Revenue Subsidiary Account. The BPNG will continue to monitor closely the difference between Temporary Advances and the Revenue Subsidiary Account; in the event of slippages in receipts, appropriate offsetting action will be taken to ensure that the target on net credit to the Government can be met. External Outlook 26. The underlying improvement in the external accounts in 1995 stemming from the fiscal adjustment and tightening of monetary conditions is partially offset by the impact of the settlement of domestic arrears carried over from the previous year and, in the capital account, the increase in commercial banks’ net foreign asset position as short-term swaps vis-a-vis the BPNG are unwound. As a result, the imbalance in the external accounts witnessed in 1994 is likely to continue in the current year, before abating in 1996. The deficit on the nonmining current account is projected to improve in 1995 to $0.5 billion (9.5 percent of GDP) compared with $0.6 billion (10.3 percent of GDP) in the previous year, though the impact on the overall balance is expected to be largely offset by a deterioration in the capital account Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50 - ANNEX1 ATTACHMENT reflecting the unwinding of swaps, partially offset by higher disbursements of project loans. With the start of construction of the Lihir gold mine, the mineral sector’s current surplus is expected to decline to $0.7 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the previous year. The higher mineral sector imports are expected to be financed largely from increased capital inflows, giving little change in the mineral sector’s overall balance between the. two years. The overall balance is expected to witness a deficit of $90 million in 1995, broadly unchanged from the previous year. In 1996, the current balance is projected to deteriorate to a deficit of $0.3 billion from a surplus of $0.2 billion in 1995 largely on account of imports associated with the Lihir and Gobe developments. The capital account is expected to improve as a result of both mineral sector project financing and the slower increase in the net foreign assets of commercial banks, and the overall balance to be in a surplus of $30 million. 27. The deficit in the balance of payments, together with the targeted buildup of reserves and Fund repurchases, gives a need for exceptional external financing in 1995 of $200 million. A further $157 million will be needed in 1996. The authorities consider that in support of a sound policy framework, this gap could be fully covered by a combination of purchases under a stand-by arrangement with the Fund; drawings under a program loan from the World E3ank; support from official bilateral creditors; the sale of assets abroad financed by external borrowing (principally Porgera); the rollover of at least $15 million of swaps; as well as, in 1996, drawings under a program loan from the Asian Development Bank. Foreign Currency Reserves 28. One of the Government’s central policy objectives is to rebuild the foreign currency reserves of the BPNG to a level of about 3-4 months of nonmining imports. Such a level would enable the BPNG to use intervention in the foreign exchange market to help offset the impact of seasonal fluctuations. in export earnings as well as to smooth erratic fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. The policies described above, together with the projected level of exceptional financing, will enable the BPNG to increase its holdings of gross reserves from $35 million at end-March 1995, to $176 million (2 months of nonmining imports) by end-1995 and $300 million (3.3 months of nonmining imports) by end-1996. Consistent with these targets, the Government has established floors on the net international reserves (NIR) of the BPNG; fi.111 reserve coverage will be maintained for all new obligations in respect of foreign exchange swaps and outright forwards with both residents and nonresidents. The authorities are committed to ensuring that the net transactions of the BPNG in the foreign exchange market (which constitute government payments of debt service and for missions abroad, and the Bank’s own net needs, less receipts of MRSF and balance of payments/budgetary support) are consistent with achieving the targeted buildup in its net international reserves. External Debt Management 29. The Government has decided to limit its external commercial borrowing and loan guarantees during 1995-96 for two main reasons: first, to provide a clear market for maljor project financing being sought for Lihir and Gobe; and second, to allow international capital markets time to observe Papua New Guinea’s improving fiscal circumstances which will enable the authorities to obtain better loan pricing. At the same time. with substantial Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5l- ANNE)!1 ATTACHMENT scheduled repayments on commercial borrowings, including the final payments on the carried stake in the Kutubu oil project, the structure of the Government’s external debt is expected to improve over 1995-96. Although the Government will generally avoid contracting new commercial loans during 1995, the public sector will issue a guarantee in mid-1995 to cover the state’s 30 percent share of the proposed $300 million loan for the -Lihir gold mine during the construction phase; the guarantee will automatically lapse at the conclusion of the construction phase, expected to be in 1997. In a similar vein, if the Government decides to exercise its option to participate in the Gobe oil project, it would borrow its share of both the entry and capital costs, possibly in the form of a carried stake. In addition, statutory authorities and the MRDC intend to contract loans amounting to $55.3 million in 1995, and a further $22.7 million in 1996 to finance investment operations. The Government has established cumulative limits on the contracting or guaranteeing by the public sector of new nonconcessional external debt with initial maturities of 1 year and up to 15 years, with a sublimit on loans with an initial maturity of 1 year and up to 5 years. The public sector will not contract debts with an initial maturity of up to one year (excluding normal import-related trade credits). Exchange System 30. Experience with the twice-daily “open-outcry” auctions for foreign exchange, introduced as a transitional measure in October 1994, has been generally favorable. Nevertheless, the Government considers that the structure of the market could give rise to certain inefficiencies. Accordingly, the BPNG has decided to introduce, in close consultation with commercial banks, a Mly functioning continuous (screen-based) market in which prices are posted, and transactions concluded, by electronic communications. The Bank’s role would continue to be limited to that of a foreign exchange broker, and the market would be open to all licensed foreign exchange dealers. The BPNG considers that market conditions should enable such arrangements to be introduced by end-July 1995 at the latest, with technical assistance from the Reserve Bank of Australia. This will be a structural performance criterion under the program. In the interim period, the initial auction step was increased from 5 to 10 basis points in June 1995. The authorities are committed to allowing the foreign exchange market to continue to operate free of direct or indirect controls. 31. The Government recognizes the importance of rebuilding the forward market in foreign exchange. While the demand for forward cover to date has been predominantly from importers, the Government considers that a combination of sound macroeconomic policies and a freely floating exchange rate accompanied by market based-domestic interest rates, should over the medium-term increase the attractiveness of forward cover to exporters. (Enabling banks to cover a portion of their forward positions with purchases from exporters, will diminish their demand for spot holdings of foreign currency and/or forward cover from the BPNG.) 32. Papua New Guinea accepted the obligations of Article VIII at the time of becoming a member of the Fund in September 1975. During the period of the stand-by arrangement, the authorities will not impose or intensify any restrictions on the making of payments or transfers for current international transactions or impose or modify multiple currency practices, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - ANNEX I ATTACHMENT conclude bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII, impose or intensify import restrictions for balance of payments reasons, or incur external arrears. Papua New Guinea has imposed payments restrictions against Iraq and against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) pursuant to the relevant UN resolutions; the Fund was notified in accordance with Decision No. 144. 33. To help ensure that exchange controls are honored and, in particular, to ensure that exporters repatriate export earnings within the prescribed period (three months for mineral exports and six months for other exports), penalties for breaches of the Foreign Exchange regulations have recently been strengthened. The BPNG has taken a cautious approach ‘to removing controls on international capital transactions, although in practice the regulations are administered liberally. The Government considers that Papua New Guinea’s controls on capital restrictions are already fairly liberal for a small open economy, but intends to ease restrictions further over time. The authorities are committed to avoiding any intensification of controls on international capital transactions. Structural and Other Issues A. Trade and Tariff Reform 34. The Government is committed to a program of further trade liberalization, and in this context has applied to join the WTO. The Government has replaced all existing import bans and quotas by tariffs except in the cases of beef/lamb (which will be removed in the November 1995 budget), cement and sugar (which we are legally obliged to maintain until October 3 1, 1995 and December 3 1, 1996, respectively, although in the interim we will make every effort to negotiate their replacement by a tariff), and those maintained for reasons of health and security. Tariffs were set at 40 percent, except for pork and pork products, vegetables and tropical fruit (75 percent) and mackerel (100 percent). It is the Government’s firm intention to avoid entering into any new agreements entailing import bans or quotas. In close collaboration with the World Bank, and subject to commitments under international agreements, the Government intends to reduce the level and dispersion of the major tariff bands in the 1996 budget. In order to help compensate for the resulting lower yield of trade taxes, the Government has requested technical assistance with the introduction of a nationally based sales tax. B. Privatization and Divestiture of Government Assets 35. Despite an increased emphasis on privatization in recent years, progress to date has fallen short of expectations. However, it is the Government’s intention to speed up substantially the implementation of the privatization program, which--apart from providing additional revenues over time--will also lead to increased efficiency and encourage private sector development. To this end, the Government announced its intention in the budget to sell off equity holdings to the value of K 50 million from the State’s interests in mining and petroleum ventures and to divest the State’s holdings in a variety of other areas, including cement, sugar, tuna, abattoirs, agricultural ventures, agricultural marketing companies, and agricultural processing ventures. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - Ai\JNEX I ATTACHMENT 36. During the course of 1995, the Government will divest its holdings in RoadCo and PNG Forest Products. It will also sell 5. I percentage points of its present holdings of the equity in the Porgera gold mine to the landowners and Enga Provincial Government; the preference shares in Ramu Sugar; and corporatize PTC Postal and Spectrum Management. The Government will also act to corporatize a number of public enterprises including ELCOM, the Harbors Board, Telecom, and Air Nuigini. C. Wage Policy 37. To ensure that inflation can be rapidly reduced and that the improvement in competitiveness resulting from the devaluation of the kina can be maintained, the Government believes that it is crucial that tight financial policies be accompanied by a disciplined wages policy. To this end, the Government announced in the budget that firm restraint will be applied to public sector wages in 1995. A public sector pay increase of 3 percent, with 1.5 percent of this backdated to January 1, 1994, has been awarded. The Government has imposed a wage freeze on the public sector for the remainder of 1995 and will maintain a tight wage policy thereafter. Given the trend-setting role of the public sector, this should have a significant moderating effect on private sector wage increases; to support this, the Government, by deferring any sitting of the Minimum Wages Board, will ensure that there is no increase in the national minimum wage in 1995. D. Agricultural Stabilization Funds 38. While the high level of support prices in recent years has played an important role in supporting the agricultural sector at a time of declining commodity prices, it also contributed to the deterioration of the budgetary position. Since mid-1994, agricultural support payments have fallen owing to the increase in commodity prices (especially for coffee) and latterly the depreciation of the kina; the export prices for coffee, copra, and palm oil all moved above their respective support prices in the second half of 1994. The budget allocated K 10 million for support payments in 1995, although on current price projections no payments are likely to be needed. Levies have now been imposed on coffee and copra producers at a rate of 65 percent of the difference between the kina export price and the domestic support price plus a 10 percent marg,in. The Government is considering reducing the levy rate to 50 percent, and increasing the margin to 26 percent; this would be consistent, on present commodity price projections, with the collection of K 25-30 million of levies in 1995. STABEX funds of up to K 8 million are also available to match any debt reduction by the industry corporations. The Government does not intend to raise domestic support prices and, on present price projections, expects that no further commodity price support will be needed in the next two years. By November 1997 at the latest, reforms will be introduced to the price support schemes to allow them to operate without any financial burden on the Government. E. Other 39. The Government has announced its intention to eliminate all price controls (which presently cover some 45 percent of consumer goods), with the exception of a few items with natural monopoly status. Where possible, this program will be implemented Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - ANNEX I ATTACHMENT contemporaneously with a reduction in domestic protection, to ensure that prices are set in a competitive fashion. As a first step, prices on a range of consumer goods and food items will be liberalized by August 1995; the remainder (excluding petroleum and utilities) will be completed by March, 1996. The Government will remove all license barriers currently restricting free trade in primary products and will remove construction and manufacturing from the list of activities currently reserved for Papua New Guineans by August 1995, and will eliminate the remaining reserved activities by March 1996. The Government will also act to finalize the necessary legislation allowing for the registration of customary land, and thereafter will develop, as soon as possible, an effective land registration system. Performance Criteria 40. Close monitoring of several key indicators, as well as the proposed performance criteria, will enable the Government to assess the performance of the adjustment program and to take any remedial measures that may be necessary to keep the program on track. The proposed quantitative performance criteria for the stand-by arrangement, which are specified in Table 1, comprise the following: (i) quarterly ceilings on the banking system’s net domestic assets, including a subceiling on net credit to the Government and the price stabilization funds; (ii) quarterly ceilings on net domestic financing of the Government and price stabilization funds; (iii) quarterly minimum levels of net international reserves of the BPNG; (iv) ceilings on the cumulative contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external borrowing by the public sector in the maturities of l-15 years, including a sublimit on l-5 years maturity; (and (v) ceilings on the stock of public and publicly guaranteed short-term foreign debt (excluding normal import-related short-term credit). 41. The program includes automatic adjustors to performance criteria in respect of certain unexpected developments in t,he external sector. To this end, the floors on NIR will be automatically increased by the fi.rll extent to which the cumulative receipts of (i) budgeted MRSF revenues (plus a margin); and (ii) balance of payments/budgetary support (excluding the.liabilities of the BPNG) exceed the targets; no automatic adjustments will be made in respect of shortfalls in inflows from these sources.’ At the same time, downward adjustments in an amount equal to the domestic currency value of the adjustments to NIR (valued at the exchange rate on the day of the receipt of foreign exchange) will be made to the limits on net credit to the Government and net domestic financing. The program also includes indicative targets on the civil service wage bill; central government expenditure; the stock of reserve money; and revenue from asset sales; a structural performance criterion on the introduction of a screen-based foreign exchange market, and structural benchmarks on the removal of price controls covering 15 percent of the consumer price index, and removal of construction and manufacturing from the list of reserved activities (Table 2). ‘No adjustment would be made in respect of either higher-than-programmed receipts of project assistance or emergency relief/rehabilitation loans specifically earmarked for Bougainville and Rabaul.

The first review, to be completed by September 14, 1.995, would focus, inter alia;oti progress on achieving the immediate stabilization objectives of the program, asset sales, the financing of the PIP, and the management of foreign exchange reserves. The second review, to be completed by February 14, 1996, would focus inter alia, on policies for 1996, including the fiscal and monetary policies, structural reforms (including tariff reforms and public sector restructuring and the fiscal impact of the reform of Provincial Governments), as well as reserve management policies, and will establish performance criteria for the remaining period of the stand-by arrangement. The third review, to be completed by August 14, 1996, would focus, inter alia, on progress with implementing stabilization policies, the financing of the PIP, as well as reserve management policies.

In the face of severe balance of payments difficulties, and following a 12 percent devaluatidn on September 12, 1994, trading in the kina was suspended on October 3. On October 10, 1994, the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) introduced, as a transitional arrangement, twice- daily’ “open-outcry” auctions to determine the exchange rate for the kina. The kina exchange rate vis-Lvis the U.S. dollar since the float and the volume of transactions in the auction are shown in Chart II. 1. I. Operation of the Auction System The auctions take place at the BPNG. The participants in the auction are the six commercial banks (the only authorized dealers in foreign exchange), and the BPNG, which acts as a broker as well as trading on its own account. The transactions channeled through the market comprise nonmineral current inflows (which must be surrendered to commercial banks), private sector current payments, and capital transactions for which exchange control approval has been obtained. Central government transactions, including most external aid inflows, mineral receipts, debt-service payments, and payments for embassies abroad, are channeled through the BPNG and do not have a direct impact on the auction. At the start of the auction, buy- and sell-orders from commercial banks (which are required to bring their gross buy/sell offers to the market) are aggregated and displayed. The auction opens at the closing exchange rate from the previous auction (quoted in U.S. dollars per kina), appreciated (depreciated) by 5 basis points if total offers to buy kina exceed (fall short of) the total offers to sell kina. The first step i.s for commercial banks which have brought matching buy and sell offers to complete their transactions. Thereafter, trades between banks take place. If offers to buy (sell) kina exceed the offers to sell (buy) at the going exchange rate, transactions are prorated among the banks holding excess offers to buy at that exchange rate. When the possibilities for trade have been exhausted, the exchange rate is adjusted by a further 5 basis points. This process continues until there are no remaining offers on one side of the auction (or if the exchange rate has moved by 50 basis points), at which point trading is terminated. Following the auction, the banks obtain tirther buy/sell orders from their larger customers and trade with retail customers at a margin over the closing rate in the last auction. ‘Since late May 1995, the number of auctions was reduced to one a day at the request of the commercial banks. ‘The initial step was increased to IO basis points in June 1995.

One important shortcoming, however, is the absence of a mechanism to ensure that the market will clear. As trading can take place before an equilibrium exchange rate has been reached, the market can close while unsatisfied demand to buy (sell) kina remains, resulting in the emergence of queuing. In these circumstances, offers to buy (sell) kina at exchange rates outside the range at which transactions are conducted will have no impact on the exchange rate, because the auction will close before such bids are reached. II. Recent Developments in the Auction Market In March-June 1995 (a period of seasonally low foreign exchange inflows combined with increased demand following the settlement of domestic arrears) there were protracted periods in which the exchange rate was insufficiently depreciated to clear the market, leading to unsatisfied demand for foreign exchange. The resulting queuing of transactions, some for as long as three weeks, delayed the transfer of foreign exchange for current transactions (including payments in respect of trade credit and debt service). To help ameliorate these difficulties, the BPNG provided support to the market both directly, through net sales of foreign currency in the auction, and indirectly, through the settlement of trade-related forward contracts by drawing down the official reserves. The scope for such intervention was limited, however, by the low level of usable reserves. Queuing in the foreign exchange market has a number of adverse effects on economic efficiency. The market sends distorted price signals. Moreover, as exporters learn that the exchange rate does not clear the market they may come to expect a further depreciation, and will likely defer repatriation of export earnings, while importers faced with the risk of queuing will likely try to obtain foreign exchange in advance of their actual needs, thereby intensifj4ng the imbalance. At the same time, the possibility of transfer risk will likely result in upward pressure on the risk premium charged on trade credit and other foreign borrowing. Queues for foreign exchange create perverse incentives for participants in the auction, as importers who require foreign exchange would actually reduce their chance of entering a successful bid by offering a more depreciated exchange rate, as auction trading would likely have finished before the bid was reached. Indeed, the chances of success would be maximized by bidding close to the previous--nonmarket clearing--price, thereby prolonging the imbalance. Moreover, queuing tends to reduce interbank trading, and thus the adjustment of the exchange rate, as banks provide all available foreign exchange to their own importers. Finally, queuing in the spot market for foreign exchange impedes the operation of the forward market, as banks will likely give preference to meeting the immediate needs of their customers (and thereby help to avoid economic dislocation and potential defaults on obligations such as debt service and letters of credit) over the use of foreign exchange as a hedge to support forward cover.

These restrictions were introduced for balance of payments purposes, are nondiscriminatory, and are temporary (they will be eliminated ‘when a continuous screen-based system is introduced by end-July 1995). III. Introduction of a Continuous Screen-Based Market for Foreign Exchange The Government of Papua New Guinea has decided to introduce by end-July 1995 a continuous screen-based market for foreign exchange with technical assistance from the Reserve Bank of Australia.3 While the details have yet to be tinalized, it is likely that the principal features of the proposed system will be as follows: the BPNG’s role would be limited to that of a foreign exchange broker, and the market would be open to all licensed foreign exchange dealers. During the daily trading sessions, the BPNG would be in contact with foreign exchange dealers via dedicated telephone lines and a screen-based communications system.. The screen would show both live prices to buy and sell kina (vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar), which could represent the interests of one or several banks. In determining whose interest is satisfied first, a higher (more appreciated) buying price would have priority over a lower buying price; while a lower selling price would have priority over a higher selling price. When more than one bank has indicated interest at the same exchange rate level, priority would be given on the basis of timing (i.e., orders received first are executed first). When all bids/offers at a particular exchange rate level have been exhausted, the next price (highest buying price, lowest selling price) would be entered on the screen. Under this system, provided there are active bids and/or offers in line, there would always be a live price shown on the screen. Finally, bids and offers could be withdrawn at any time, and they would in any event expire at the end of each daily trading session. A screen-based system would have a number of clear advantages over the current auction arrangements. First, it would enable market participants to adjust rapidly to new information (including the evolving pattern of supply and demand in the market), in contrast to the current system in which adjustments take place only slowly in a number of discrete steps, possibly spread over several days. As a result, the exchange rate would be expected to adjust more smoothly, and allow transactions’to be completed after a relatively short lag. Unsatisfied bids and/or offers will remain live, and thereby provide appropriate signals to other market participants. This in turn will ensure that live transactions would remain in a queue for the briefest possible period. While it is recognized that not all transactions could be completed instantaneously in a thin market, this should significantly ameliorate the problems described in Section II above. ‘Technical assistance on the design of a screen-based system was provided jointly by MAE; and the Reserve Bank of Australia in October-November 1994. At that time it was envisaged that the system would be introduced by end- 1994. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-61 - ANNEX II IV. Forward Market for Foreign Exchange Authorized dealers are permitted to offer forward contracts to buy and sell kina for all bona fide current transactions. In practice, however, the forward market in Papua New Guinea is dominated by contracts to sell foreign exchange. The BPNG discontinued providing automatic cover for commercial banks in May 1993 and reduced substantially the size of its forward book. As a result, there was a structural shift in holdings of foreign exchange away from the BPNG and toward the commercial banks, as banks used foreign balances to hedge their forward books.4 While official data are not available on the developments in the forward market, indirect indicators suggest that there was a sharp increase in the demand for forward cover in the middle of 1994 in the face of considerable uncertainty concerning the exchange rate, but that the market declined to more normal levels by the turn of the year reflecting diminished uncertainty. During this period, the BPNG resumed intervention in the forward market in order to strengthen the reserve position. In the first quarter of 1995, however, the size of the forward market declined dramatically as the BPNG unwound its forward position, and commercial banks became increasingly unwilling to offer forward cover in the face of tight liquidity conditions and the emergence of queuing in the spot market. 4Commercial banks are subject to prudential limits on their uncovered forward position, but in practice keep their forward book fully covered so as to limit their exposure to exchange rate risk.

Exchange Rate Arrangement From December 1976, the kina was pegged to a basket of currencies of Papua New Guinea’s major trading partners and from April 1980, the U.S. dollar was used as the intervention currency. The representative rate of the kina agaimt the U.S. dollar was the midpoint between buying and selling rates for spot transactions in U.S. dollars as determined daily by the BPNG. On September 11, 1994, the kina was devalued by 12 percent against the U.S. dollar; on October 4, 1994 with reserves at very low levels, kina trading was suspended, and the Government announced that it would float the currency from October 10, 1994. Under the new exchange rate regime, the value of the kina is determined in a daily interbank auction brokered by the BPNG; outside the auction, commercial banks are allowed to freely negotiate the exchange rate with their customers. Exchange restrictions against Iraq were imposed in August 1990 and continue to be maintained in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 661, Exchange restrictions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’(Serbia/Montenegro) were imposed in July 1992, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 757. VIII. Article IV Consultation Papua New Guinea is on the standard 12-lmonth consultation cycle.

This includes a structural adjustment loan which was fully disbursed in December 199 1. The Bank’s assistance strategy continues to focus on the following interdependent objectives: (i) structural reforms; (ii) sound macroeconomic management; (iii) strengthening public sector management, especially public investment preparation and implementation, as well as improving institutional capacity; (iv) human resource development; (v) environmental management, emphasizing sustainable forestry development; and (vi) coordination of international support. Thus far, there has been only one IFC investment in Papua New Guinea: a US$13 million investment in a tuna canning operation, approved in August 1993. IFC continues to look for other private sector initiatives and, through the South Pacific Facility, is assisting in the development of project proposals and in the mobilization of funding. Papua New Guinea signed the MIGA Convention in 1990. To date, no MIGA guarantee arrangements have been concluded.

Of this total, 17 loans amounting to US$224.98 million were made from ordinary capital resources and 25 loans totaling US$320.75 million were made from special fund resources. In addition, US$21.4 million has been provided for 80 technical assistance projects. In 1994, only one emergency loan for USSO. million was approved as the Government wished to concentrate on the implementation of existing projects. The AsDB’s strategy focuses on sustainable employment generation, achieving competitiveness in the nonmineral sectors and creating a policy environment, including infrastructure support, that stimulates private sector growth. In broad terms, the AsDB’s medium-term strategy is to assist the Government in the formulation and implementation of appropriate sector policies and the development of institutional frameworks for employment creation, output diversification, and economic growth on a sustainable basis. The AsDB will continue to focus on four key areas: agriculture, including fisheries and marine resources; health; water supply and sewerage; and education. For the 1995 program there are two stand-by loans amounting to about US$25 million and five technical assistance grants amounting to about US$l.63 million. Over the next three years, annual lending is projected to be about US$33 million with technical assistance grants at about US$l.2 million per year. In addition, a program loan may be provided in 1996 subject to progress made in structural adjustment. Table I.

Data relating to the national accounts and the balance of payments in particular are of an uncertain quality and subject to considerable delay in compilation. The staff has encountered significant problems in the past in obtaining data from the authorities on a timely basis. However, the staff has emphasized the importance of the regular reporting of data, and there has been a noticeable improvement in recent months. I. Real Sector The National Statistical Office (NSO) produces annual estimates of the production and expenditure sides of the national accounts in collaboration with the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG). However, despite an Asian Development Bank funded project in the NSO in 1990 and 1991 to improve data collection, methodology, and systems for the national accounts, the data are of poor quality, particularly on the expenditure side. The data are not published on a timely basis, although the BPNG now produces its own estimates of the broad components of the accounts based on a voluntary survey of large companies ahead of official publication; they are also frequently, and often substantially, revised. The major impediment to the production of timely and reliable national account statistics appears to be the weak institutional capacity of the NSO. A national accounts statistics adviser will be available to the Papua New Guinea authorities under the regional national accounts project. It is expected that his visits (four three-week missions are plannecl) will provide the catalyst for an improvement in the statistics in this area. The consumer price index is only published on a quarterly basis and is subject to a three-month lag, making it somewhat untimely. The weights used in the calculation of the index are based on 1977 data and are unlikely to be representative of current expenditure patterns. Efforts need to be made to calculate and publish the index on a monthly basis and t.o update the weights used in calculating the index. The BPNG publishes a quarterly index of employment, but again with a significant lag (currently the index is available only up to the September quarter of 1994).

Government Finance Data on government finance appear to be of a reasonably sound and reliable quality, and are to a large extent compiled in line with the standard Fund format. Recently, problems have been encountered with foreign debt data as they appear to be incompatible with the data provided for foreign financing and with data for interest payments-debt service (in Table B) that are inconsistent with interest payments data in Table C. Papua New Guinea is a regular contributor to the GFS Yearbook; preliminary data for 1992 and forecast data for 1993 were published in the 1994 Yearbook. III. Monetary Accounts Recent changes to the methodology and presentation of the monetary accounts have brought them more into line with the standard Fund presentation. Problems have been encountered in reconciling the monetary data with the financing of the Government budget deficit from the fiscal accounts. Data are reported to STA on an irregular basis, and with a considerable delay. Monetary accounts and interest rate data through June 1994 are shown in the May 1995 II??. IV. Balance of Payments There are significant problems in the balance of payments statistics in Papua New Guinea. The BPNG produces balance of payments data, measured on a cash flow basis, which cover all transactions that flow through the banking system, and some other transactions. Data are collected monthly and aggregated into quarterly and annual totals. Reconciliation with customs data has only been made up to 1992 for exports and 1990 for imports. Customs is still introducing the new computerized ASYCUDA system for processing customs declarations. A significant improvement will be made when merchandise trade statistics based on customs returns are produced on a timely basis, but progress so far has been slow. Other areas of particular concern are the treatment of the mining sector, the capital account data, and the integration of the debt reporting system with the balance of payments statistics. The statistical advisor from the PFTAC visited Papua New Guinea in October 1994 to review the methodology and compilation of the balance of payments statistics. Several recommendations were made and a follow-up visit is scheduled for October 1995. Data published in the Halarrce of Payments Yearbook is significantly out of date, with data up to the third quarter of 1990 available in the 1993 Yearbook. Through IFS, balance of payments data is available on an annual basis up to 1993. Exchange rate data available up to December 1994 as shown in the May 1995 /I?$.
