Introduction and Staff Aovraisal At the Executive Board discussion of the Japan staff report last July, Directors noted that a mild recovery had begun, although downside risks remained. On monetary policy, views were mixed: some Directors believed that a cut in interest rates was not appropriate, while others argued that further easing was needed, in part to offset yen appreciation and declining inflation. On fiscal policy, Directors believed that, in view of the substantial stimulus that had already been provided, no further measures were called for at that time; consolidation efforts should be resumed once the recovery was clearly established. They urged a strengthening of efforts to remove structural rigidities, promote deregulation, and open markets. In the event, the recovery continued through 1994, although growth was weak by historical standards and the pace uneven. Indicators in early 1995 pointed to a gradual strengthening of the recovery, reflecting the unwinding of the forces that had initially led to the downturn--the sharp decline in asset prices from unsustainable levels and stock adjustments by firms and households. But the renewed appreciation of the yen since mid-February, the simultaneous drop in equity prices, and the fragility of the financial system posed new risks to the outlook in the period leading up to the consultation discussions in mid-May. Against this background, the discussions focussed on the underlying pace of the recovery and the steps to address the risks posed by yen appreciation. u At that time, there were indications that the recovery was proceeding, albeit slowly, and that the sharp appreciation of the yen could be (at least partially) reversed. Thus, the staff believed that, with the cut in the official discount rate (ODR) in April and the introduction of the first supplementary budget for FY 1995, there was adequate economic support for the time being, but advocated further stimulus measures if the recovery were jeopardised. Subsequent developments indicate that the downside risks have indeed materialized: the yen remains high, equity prices have dropped further, the GDP outturn for the first quarter was unexpectedly weak, and indicators point to continued softness in the second quarter. Therefore, the staff believes that further stimulative measures are now necessary. The remainder of this section provides the staff appraisal of policy requirements; it also serves as a summary of issues for Board discussion. Section II describes the economic situation and outlook. Finally, Section III reports on the discussions, which dealt with the possible need for additional monetary and fiscal stimulus, strains in the financial sector and measures to accelerate their resolution, and the scope for further structural reforms to enhance growth and raise living standards. u The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions took place during May 11-23. The staff team consisted of Messrs. Aghevli (Head), Meredith, Chadha, Lutz, Mihaljek, Okamura and Ms. Lipworth (all CTA), and Mr. Prasad (RES). Mr. Mesaki, Executive Director for Japan, also participated in the discussions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 2 - 1. In the staff's view, the appreciation of the yen since the beginning of the year has taken it to levels that are dlearly overvalued in terms of fundamentals. While a high yen would tend to reduce the current account surplus after J-curve effects have worked through, it would intensify internal disequilibrium and deflationary pressures. Indeed, its impact on activity could be magnified in the current circumstances by the underlying fragilities in the labor market and the financial sector. Based on the mid-June level of about Y84 per U.S. dollar, the staff now projects real GDP growth of only l/2 percent in 1995, rising to 1 l/2 percent in 1996. 2. The immediate prospect of continued stagnation calls for providing additional support to activity. On the monetary side, in spite of low nominal interest rates, real interest rates appear high given the severity of the downturn, and monetary conditions have tightened as a result of yen appreciation. Thus, while the scope for further easing is clearly limited, the staff believes that a cut in the official discount rate (ODR) from the current level of 1 percen C. is needed--the spread between market interest rates and the ODR should be narrowed at the same time. A reduction in the ODR should be supported by unsterilized intervention to further ease credit conditions and counteract upward pressures on the yen. 3. Fiscal policy has provided substantial support to activity through successive stimulus packages, and the first supplementary budget for N 1995 will tend to offset the unwinding of spending from previous measures. Nevertheless, recent signs of weakening public investment underscore the need to avoid a premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus at this stage of the cycle. Additional measures should be prepared that would maintain a high level of support to activity until the recovery is firmly in place. Notwithstanding the substantial fiscal deterioration (the budget deficit excluding social security has risen to 7 percent of GDP from approximate balance prior to the downturn), the risks of continued economic stagnation outweigh the costs of a further, temporary, deterioration in the deficit. 4. The unavoidable deterioration in the fiscal position in the short term, however, heightens the need to resume consolidation once the recovery is established. Steps will be needed both to reverse past stimulative measures and to address spending pressures associated with population aging. The reform of public pensions introduced last year is an important move in this direction, but additional actions will be needed to put the fiscal position on a sustainable footing. A comprehensive plan should be formulated for achieving this goal, including identifying possible savings from compressing current spending and assessing the need for future tax increases. In pursuing consolidation, account should be taken of the efficiency of public spending and the need to further develop Japan's social infrastructure. 5. Measures to address strains in the financial sector are critically needed. The announcement in early June of a strategy for accelerating the resolution of this problem is a welcome acknowledgement of its magnitude, and the potential risks it creates. It is necessary, however, to translate this strategy into concrete actions as soon as possible. In particular, a contingency plan should be formulated to rescue institutions in case of a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 3 - systemic threat- -including the use of public funds if necessary. Steps are also needed to: accelerate the writing-down of the banks' problem loans; deepen their capital base; enhance disclosure requirements; strengthen the deposit insurance system; and adopt more transparent accounting standards. More generally, reforms to the financial sector should include: the repeal of fixed brokerage commissions; the reduction or elimination of the securities transactions tax; the easing of restrictions on the listing of new types of securities; and review of the role of the Postal Savings system. 6. The agenda for structural reform and deregulation must be pushed forward ambitiously. Successfully meeting the challenges in this area will enhance medium- and long-term growth prospects, and ensure that growth is fully translated into higher living standards. While the acceleration of the five-year deregulation plan announced in April is welcome, strong additional actions are needed in certain key areas, including agriculture, land use, telecommunications, and distribution and retail trade. 7. Structural issues are closely intertwined with Japan's trade relationships with the rest of the world. Reforms that promote competitive forces would enhance the transparency of Japan's markets and access to them by new producers- -both domestic and foreign-- leading to a more dynamic and open domestic economy to match the successes of Japan's export sector. Increased openness would also have the desirable effect of distributing the impact of exchange rate changes more broadly across the economy, and ensuring their full passthrough to domestic prices. 8. Concern remains that bilateral trade negotiations on a sector-by-sector basis may generate pressures for market-sharing arrangements that ultimately reduce competition. Thus, it is in Japan's interest to unilaterally adopt a sweeping program of market opening, with benefits available to all countries. Indeed, resistance to "nonmarket" solutions to trade frictions heightens the need to enhance market access on the basis of multilateral principles. 9. The current account surplus is primarily a macroeconomic phenomenon, reflecting both Japan's high structural saving rate and the cyclical downturn in spending. The cyclical component would be eliminated by a recovery in activity, while the structural component would continue to make a desirable contribution to world savings. Given these macroeconomic factors, enhancing market access would lead to increases in both imports and exports, without necessarily reducing the current account surplus. The staff continues to believe that market opening should be pursued vigorously in its own right, rather than being targeted to the current account.

The start of recoverv Real GDP bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 1993 at a level 1 l/4 percent below the peak reached in the first quarterof 1992. The subsequent recovery, however, has been weak: output grew at an average annual rate of only 3/4 percent from the fourth quarter of 1993 through the first quarter of 1995, compared with average growth of 5 l/2 percent in past recoveries (Charts 1 and 2, and Table 1). In addition, the pace has faltered in the last two quarters, showing a sharp decline in the last quarter of 1994 and only a marginal rise in the first quarter of 1995--at the end of 1995, real per capita GDP is expected reach the same level as at end-1991. The estimated output gap has widened to over 5 percent of potential. u The main factor underlying the modest turnaround in activity has been a reduced pace of decline in private fixed investment (see the following tabulation). Indeed, after a further sharp fall in the first half of 1994, this component of spending grew at an average annual rate of 1 l/4 percent over the following three quarters. Similarly, the negative contribution of inventory investment to growth in 1992-93 has since been reversed. Growth in private consumption has risen only marginally, however, notwithstanding the income tax cuts implemented in June 1994. While private spending has picked up, the stimulus provided by higher government spending has moderated, as public investment plateaued at a high level in mid-1994 before dropping sharply in the first quarter of 1995. w The negative contribution of net exports to growth has been relatively stable over the recession and recovery periods.

Alternative approaches to estimating potential output are discussed in the background papers to this report. 2/ Public investment stood at 9 percent of GDP in 1994, having risen steadily during the recession from an average of 6 l/2 percent in the late 1980s--the average level for other G-7 countries is about 3 percent of GDP.

Production recovered steadily through 1994 and early 1995, rising at an average annual rate of 6 percent, although by March it still remained 7 percent below its historical peak. However, following the sharp appreciation of the ,yen and a rise in inventory levels in the first quarter, industrial production declined in April and May, and firms' projections point to further declines in June and July. The unemployment rate rose in late 1994 to the previous peak of 3 percent reached briefly in 1987, marking a large swing--by Japanese standards--from the trough of 2 percent in early 1992. 1/ It subsequently increased to slightly over 3 percent in April and May, reflecting further declines in employment. In addition, many private sector analysts estimate that 2-3 million of the employed represent "excess" workers that have been kept on firms' payrolls. Declines in April and May Ln the ratio of job- offers-to-seekers and total hours worked provided additional signs of weakness in labor markets. Reflecting large margins of excess capacity and the effects of yen appreciation, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by only 3/4 percent in 1994. More recently, disinflation has turned into (slight) deflation, as the level of the CPI in March-April stood l/4 percent below the previous year's level. Anecdotal evidence suggests that price declines may be larger when discounting and changes in consumer spending patterns are accounted for. Domestic wholesale prices dropped by almost 2 percent in 1994, bringing the total decline since 1991 to 4 percent. The pace of decline in the WPI, however, slowed through 1994 and early 1995, as the effects of earlier yen appreciation waned and demand conditions firmed. Wage settlements have also decelerated, but less quickly than prices: the spring "shunto" for 1995 generated an average wage increase of 2 3/4 percent (a historic low), down slightly from 3 percent in 1994. The current account surplus, which had risen to over 3 percent of GDP in 1992-93, declined to 2 3/4 percent in 1994 and then to 2 l/4 percent in the first four months of 1995 (Chart 4). While the pick-up in domestic demand has been modest, the lagged effects of earlier yen appreciation boosted import volume growth to over 15 percent (annual rate) through late 1994 and early 1995, close to the peak rates reached during the bubble period. The effect on the trade surplus, however, has been moderated by renewed growth in export volumes, as strong activity in other Asian economies and the United States has offset the effects of yen appreciation. L/ The relatively low and stable rate of unemployment in Japan is, however, partly a statistical artifact: for example, an individual working for as little as one hour in the reporting week is counted as employed. Also, the short period of unemployment benefits for younger and part-time workers results in their rapid exclusion from the labor force and thus the measured pool of unemployed.

The fiscal position has deteriorated substantially following the collapse of the bubble economy and the introduction of several countercyclical packages. From 1991 to 1994, the overall balance shifted from a surplus of 3 percent of GDP to a deficit of an equivalent size (Chart 5 and Table 2). Excluding social security, the deficit rose to almost 7 percent of GDP in 1994, approaching its historical peaks reached the late 1970s. Of the overall deterioration, slightly over one half reflects the impact of discretionary actions, and the remainder the impact of the cyclical downturn in revenues. in Following the cut in the official discount rate (ODR) to 1 3/4 percent in September 1993, short-term interest rates were relatively stable through the first half of 1994 (Chart 6). By late summer, amid growing signs of recovery, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) signalled a modest tightening of policy by guiding up the overnight call rate by l/4 percentage point, prompting similar increases in other short-term rates. Government bond yields rose to about 4 3/4 percent in the second half of 1994, reflecting increases in short-term rates, higher overseas yields, and improving economic prospects. Equity prices, as measured by the Nikkei 225 index, fluctuated through much of 1994 at around 20,000, well above the trough reached in August 1992. Following its sharp appreciation from mid-1992 to mid-1993, the yen was broadly stable (in effective terms) through early 1995, as a further mild rise against the dollar was accompanied by a fall against European currencies (Chart 7). From mid-February through mid-April, however, the yen rose by another 15 percent in effective terms. The cumulative increase of about 50 percent since mid-1992 has taken the yen well above historical trends (Box 1 and Chart 8). h/ At end-March, citing downside risks to the recovery against the background of yen appreciation, the BOJ eased policy via a reduction in the overnight call rate, bringing it for the first time below the level of the ODR. Market reaction to the limited nature of the easing, however, was unfavorable, as reflected in a further rise in the yen and drop in equity prices. In mid-April, acknowledging the possible negative impact of these market developments, the BOJ cut the ODR to 1 percent, a new low. Short- term market interest rates initially fell to about 1 l/4 percent. Reflecting expectations of further easing, these rates dropped by a further 15 basis points in early June. At the same time, long-term bond yields declined to slightly below 3 percent. 1/ The background paper examines the recent appreciation of the yen in the context of its longer-term movements, and discusses possible explanations.

The sharp appreciation of the yen since the beginning of the year-- coming on top of the rise in the.1993--has taken various measures of its real effective value well above historical trends (Chart 8). The average deviation now amounts to about 25 percent, exceeding the gaps of 18 percent in 1978 and 12 percent in 1988. l Divergent long-run trends. From a longer-term perspective, the various measures of the yen's real value have shown much different trend movements: the CPI-based index has risen steadily since the early 1950s at an average rate of about 3 percent per year; the WPI-based measure was stable through the early 1970s before rising by 1 l/2 percent per year; while the measure based on export unit values fell through the mid-1960s, but has since fluctuated around a fairly stable level. 0 Productivity growth gaps. The principal explanation for these divergent trends is different sectoral rates of productivity growth across countries. In Japan, the gap between productivity growth in the tradable versus nontradable sectors has been larger than in its trading partners. As a result, export prices have fallen relative to consumer and wholesale prices more rapidly than elsewhere. Thus, the trend appreciation of the CPI- and WPI-based measures of the yen's value has not jeopardized Japan's export competitiveness (the "Balassa" effect). 0 Fixed- verms floating-rate periods. Trend growth in the CPI- based index has been stable over the fixed- and floating-rate periods. The split between price and nominal exchange rate movements has differed, however: under fixed rates, Japan's inflation rate was well above that in partner countries, while the yen's nominal value was constant; under floating rates, Japan's inflation rate has been below that in partners', while the nominal exchange rate has appreciated sharply. Volatility of the real exchange rate--based on all three measures- -has been considerably greater under floating than under fixed rates. . Implications of the high yen. Interest rates in Japan are currently well below those in other major countries, sugges,ting that markets expect the yen to continue to appreciate over the medium term. staff projections indicate that such an appreciation--from its current high level--would reinforce internal disequilibrium and deflationary pressures in Japan, implying tensions between the path expected by markets and that required to achieve a medium-term equilibrium. u The issues in this box are discussed in more detail in the background papers to the report.

Most of the rise, however, is due to shifts from deposits that are not included in this definition of broad money; growth in M3 has been relatively stable in a range of 3 l/2-4 l/2 percent since 1992. In contrast with the continued growth in broad money, domestic credit and bank lending have both been roughly flat since 1993, as private loan demand has remained weak. 2. Economic outlook Looking ahead, the stimulus from some of the components that underpinned growth in 1994. -including government spending, residential investment, and stockbuilding- -is expected to wane through 19!)5. At the same time, the sharp yen appreciation will reinforce the decline in net exports. Hence, further expansion will depend on a recovery lin business fixed investment and/or an acceleration of growth in private consumption. Looking first at business investment, the top panel of Chart 9 illustrates how the investment boom in the late 1980s was preceded by a surge in both corporate profits and equity prices. The weakening in these measures of financial conditions starting in 1990 foreshadowed the sharp contraction in investment beginning in mid-1991. The continuing high level of investment following the earlier boom, however, caused the capital-to- output ratio to continue to rise, peaking at almost 10 percent above its historical trend by early 1993 (Chart 9, lower panel). More recently- -but prior to the recent appreciation of the yen --corporate financial conditions had shown some improvement. From the trough in mid-1992, equity prices rose by 35 percent through end-1994, while profits grew by over 10 percent in 1994 and an even larger rise was expected this year. In addition, the "flow" adjustment to the overhang of the capital stock appeared to be well advanced, as the investment-to-output ratio had fallen to a level consistent with unwinding the excess stock by the end of the decade. Finally, the destruction of capital due to the Kobe earthquake (amounting to an estimated l/2 percent of the totall stock) would boost spending for reconstruction. Thus, conditions early in 1995 appeared favorable for a recovery in business investment. Unfortunately, the recent appreciation of the yen has thrown this outlook into doubt. Corporate profits are now projected to rlise only marginally in 1995 if the exchange rate stabilizes in the range of V80-85 per U.S. dollar. Equity prices dropped in early June to near their 1992 lows, reflecting expectations of weaker activity and profits. Slowing industrial production in recent months will tend to reduce the demand for additional capacity. Finally, yen appreciation has strengthened the incentive to locate production abroad-- recent data show a pick-up in foreign direct investment, especially in Asia. Indicators are not all negative, however: the May Tankan survey pointed to a further improvement in business conditions (although by less than had earlier been projected); investment intentions for F'Y 1995 called for growth of 3 l/4 percent (compared with a decline of 1 percent in the previous survey).

As a result; the household saving rate rose from an already high level of 14 percent'in 1990 to 15 l/4 percent in 1994, leading to a rebuilding of about 80 percent of the initial drop in household financial assets by end-1994. Labor income is expected to grow moderately in 1995 as a stabilization of hours worked and bonus payments (following declines during 1992-94) would offset slower growth in hourly wages and emp1oymen.t. Real in,come growth would be further boosted by an expected drop in the consumptison deflator. Thus, from the perspective of "fundamentals," the outlook for consumption appeared good earlier in the year. But translating this improvement into increased spending depends critically on household confidence, in particular in labor market conditions. From this perspective, the rise in the yen has renewed fears about the impact of industrial "hollowing out" on domestic employment and wages. The situation, then, is one in which both firms and households have corrected much of the original imbalances that led to the economic downturn. But the impact on spending may be stalled by a deterioration in cyclical conditions due to yen appreciation. The high yen will weaken corporate profits and bonus payments to workers, reduce equity prices, depress the hidden reserves of financial institutions, and accelerate employment adjustments. Furthermore, the resulting deflationary pressures would induce households and firms to postpone spending decisions. The staff believes that, given the fragility of economic conditions, the effect on growth of the recent appreciation of the yen is likely to be "nonlinear." 2/ In particular, the direct impact on trade flows would be reinforced by a stalling of business investment, a further rise in the unemployment rate, and a softening in consumption. In this environment--and assuming unchanged policies l/--real GDP is likely to grow by only slightly over 1 percent through 1995, implying growth of less than u Econometric estimates suggest that land prices play only a limited role in explaining consumption behavior. 2/ The typical "linear" response to a rise in the yen of 10 percent would be a reduction in the real growth rate of l/2 percentage point per year for two years. 2/ Unchanged policies are defined as a continuation of the mid-June level of short-term nominal interest rates and implementation of the first supplementary budget for FY 1995, implying a roughly neutral fiscal stance.

The output gap would widen to almost 7 percent of GDP, while consumer prices would continue to fall slightly in 1995-96. The current account surplus would decline to just below 2 l/2 percent of GDP. III. ReDort on the Discussions u At the time of the consultation discussions in mid-May, the strength of the downside risks posed by yen appreciation remained to be seen. Thus, the discussions dealt primarily with the measures that could be taken if the recovery were jeopardized. While recognizing that the scope for additional action was limited, the staff underscored that such a situation would call for timely use of the available room for providing monetary and fiscal stimulus. (In the staff's view, the downside risks have materialized subsequent to the discussions and, accordingly, the staff appraisal now calls for policy action.) The staff also discussed the situation in the financial sector and pointed to several steps that should be taken to address these strains. On structural issues, the staff urged the adoption of a more ambitious reform agenda. 1. Monetary ~olicv and the exchanee rate The latest episode of yen appreciation was attributed to a variety of factors, including: the risk-averse stance of Japanese investors; trade tensions with the United States; and the divergent external positions of Japan and the United States. There was broad agreement, though, that recent movements in the yen could not be fully explained by fundamentals, and that the yen had overshot its longer-term equilibrium level (Box 1). Some reversal of recent movements was thus expected at the time of the discussions. Intervention had been used to offset short-term pressures in exchange markets, but it was recognized that such actions would have little effect in offsetting market forces over longer periods. 1/ If, in contrast to unchanged policies, the ODR were cut by 1 per- centage point in mid-1995, projected growth in 1995 would rise by about l/4 percentage point and in 1996 by about 3/4 percentage point. Additional government spending of 3/4 percent of GDP would raise growth by an equivalent amount at the time the spending was implemented, based on the staff's assumption of a multiplier of unity. u Concerning the adequacy of national data sources, Japan's data are generally of high quality. Improvements would be desirable, however, in the area of national accounts data, as part of a general review of their quality. The staff encouraged the authorities to provide more disaggregated and timely information on the components of national expenditure, including external trade, private consumption, and business investment.

Furthermore, coordinating interest rate changes with other countries held the risk that monetary policy could become excessively oriented to external factors, at the expense of overall economic stability. Thus, recent actions had been motivated by domestic considerations. l-hey recognized that the easing of monetary conditions at end-March, without cutting the discount rate, had sent a confusing signal to markets. The ODR had been cut shortly thereafter, restoring a more normal relationship between market and official interest rates. The monetary authorities held the view that there was little room left for further easing, pointing to the scope for additional fiscal stimulus and/or structural reforms to support growth, if necessary. In any event, they believed that the recovery would continue without further stimulus measures, albeit at a mild pace. The staff argued that, notwithstanding the latest cut in interest rates, monetary conditions remained tight in light of the weak cyclical situation and risks to the outlook. Declines in nominal interest rates to historic lows had been offset by yen appreciation, falling inflation, and widening bank intermediation spreads. Indeed, with the rise in the yen through April, the staff's monetary conditions index (MCI) had reached the peak levels last observed in 1990-91 (Chart 10). The staff agreed that there was limited room for further reductions in interest rates before nominal interest rates would be virtually zero. Nonetheless, timely use should be made of this room if signs emerged that the recovery was stalling. Lower interest rates would provide desirable support to equity prices, offset upward pressures on the yen, lower corporate financing costs, and reduce the burden of nonperforming loans. Waiting too long to act held the risk that conditions could deteriorate in a way that would reduce the ultimate effectiveness of any monetary easing and undermine future recovery prospects. The staff also believed that, when domestic and external requirements coincided across countries, coordination could have a desirable effect in signalling to markets the intentions of policymakers. Of course, policies in each country would have to respond flexibly to changes in their circumstances. An important question is what further monetary steps could be taken to stimulate activity if market interest rates had already approached zero. Theory suggests that it would be difficult to sustain negative nominal interest rates through, for instance, a tax on deposits, given the resulting incentives for holding cash. u Alternatively, the authorities could continue to purchase domestic assets and thus expand the monetary base (although as lending rates became closer to zero, such assets would increasingly be held as excess reserves by the banks). Open market operations could be reinforced by unsterilized intervention to push down the yen, boosting the economy through the exchange rate effect. 1/ At a zero nominal interest rate, the demand for cash tends to become very large, as in the Keynesian "liquidity trap."

Fiscal policy The initial budget for FY 1995 (April-March) was broadly neutral from a cyclical viewpoint, continuing the pattern of recent years. Starting in late 1992, support to activity has been provided through a series of stimulative packages implemented in the form of supplementary budgets. In addition, a temporary income tax cut was introduced in mid-1994 that reduced taxes by Y5 l/2 trillion (1 l/4 percent of GDP). In late 1994, the Diet passed a comprehensive tax reform plan that replaced this measure by a permanent cut of Y3 l/2 trillion combined with a temporary cut of Y2 trillion through 1995 (and possibly 1996). The revenue loss is to be offset by a rise in the consumption tax, from 3 percent to 5 percent, in April 1997. While the initial budget is neutral relative to last year's initial budget, in practice it would imply a mild withdrawal of stimulus due to the unwinding of spending from previous stimulative packages. In the event, the Government passed in late May the first supplementary budget for FY 1995 amounting to Y2.7 trillion (l/2 percent of GDP), mostly for earthquake reconstruction. Higher spending and revenue shortfalls would be covered by the issuance of both construction and deficit-financing bonds. The authorities were of the view that the first supplementary budget would provide sufficient support to the recovery at the current juncture. They were optimistic that the recent slowdown in indicators of public investment was due to temporary factors, and that further growth would be observed through 1995. They also noted that, as usual, there would be a supplementary budget in the fall to provide for disaster relief and civil servants* wage increases. The possibility had not been excluded that this budget could be used to provide additional economic stimulus, if needed. The staff agreed that the fiscal stance was appropriate in the current juncture. And the substantial deterioration in the fiscal position, even after adjusting for the effects of the downturn on revenues, clearly limited the scope for further action. Nevertheless, the costs of continued economic stagnation--given the already large output gap- -would outweigh those of an additional, temporary, rise in the deficit if the recovery was jeopardized. In late June, a new economic package was announced that front-loaded about 75 percent of public works spending into the first half of F'Y 1995, and indicated the likelihood of further stimulus measures in the fall. Over the longer term, MOF officials noted that the fiscal outlook appeared unfavorable in the absence of strong consolidation measures. But it was very difficult to plan beyond a near-term horizon, in part because of obstacles to achieving a political consensus on the appropriate measures. The staff urged the authorities to illustrate the seriousness of the problem by presenting medium-term scenarios with and without new policy measures Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - (Box 2 discusses the staff's medium-term baseline projection). Such scenarios would quantify the savings that 'could be achieved by compressing current spending--for instance through reforms to the welfare and health care systems --and taking new revenue measures beyond the planned increase in the consumption tax in FY 1997. The discussions also dealt with the scope for allocating funds for public investment more flexibly to reflect changing social needs. The authorities noted the strong pressures for putting greater weight on new areas of spending, such as information technology and similar projects. In this context, they expressed two reservations: many of these projects were not properly in the government domain; and such an expansion of the scope of government spending could lead to calls by interest groups for potentially wasteful spending. While acknowledging these concerns, the staff noted that indications of continuing deficiencies in some areas of Japan's social infrastructure capital --notwithstanding high levels of government investment --suggested the need for a reappraisal of spending priorities. 3. Financial sector Despite increased write-offs by banks in 1994, balance sheets remain burdened by problem loans. For the 21 major banks, "narrowly" defined nonperforming loans declined only marginally to Y12 l/2 trillion at end-March 1995 from Y13 l/2 trillion a year earlier (see following tabulation). u This definition, however, does not include loans that have been restructured at below-market interest rates (including those to housing loan companies), or those to the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC). The total value of problem loans at the major banks is estimated by market analysts to be in the range of V30-35 trillion (about 7 percent of GDP). u Little information is available on the asset quality of other institutions, and in particular the loosely regulated credit cooperatives. In early June, however, the MOF released an estimate of Y40 trillion in problem loans for all institutions--the first official estimate of the overall size of the problem. Some private analysts put the total figure in the range of Y55-80 trillion. u Defined as loans to bankrupt companies and those on which interest is more than 6 months overdue. 2/ The major banks have about V4 l/2 trillion in specific reserves for losses against these loans, and an estimated Y8 l/2 trillion in "hidden" reserves on equity holdings. In addition, their capital base is about Y40 trillion (combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital measured according to BIS guidelines). The banks' situation is discussed in the background paper to this report. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - Box 2. Medium-Tena Fiscal Outlook 0 Deterioration since 1990 in the fiscal position. As a result of weak activity and counter-cyclical fiscal actions--including four stimulus packages and the income tax cut starting in 1994--the general government balance has deteriorated by 7 percent of GDP during PY 1990-1995 (Chart 5). Most of the consolidation effort in the 1980s has thus been reversed. l "Core" deficit in 1995. The general government deficit '(excluding social security) in M 1995 of 7 percent of GDP can be decomposed into three components: (i) the impact of the cycle (estimated at 2 percent of GDP); (ii) the effect of temporary measures--including the carry- over of spending from past fiscal packages, funds for earthquake reconstruction, and the temporary component of the income tax cut (totalling 1 l/4 percent of GDP); and (iii) a remaining "core" structural deficit of 3 3/4 percent of GDP. a Projected improvement through 1997. As the recovery eventually picks up, the cyclical component of the deficit is projected to narrow slightly to 1 3/4 percent of GDP in F'Y 1997. Moreover, the temporary measures would be unwound, and the consumption tax increase would take effect in April 1997 (the latter would raise revenues by 3/4 percent of GDP). These developments would be partially offset by higher spending on pensions and public investment. The net effect would be a narrowing in the deficit (excluding social security) to 5 l/2 percent of GDP in FY 1997. The core structural deficit remains at 3 3/4 percent of GDP. 0 Renewed deterioration beyond 1997. After 1997, despite the elimination of the cyclical weakness in revenues, the deficit is projected to widen. Population aging raises both medical spending and the central government contribution to the public pension plan, public investment spending rises in line with the lo-year public investment plan, and debt-servicing payments grow. By FY 2000, the deficit (excluding social security) increases to 5 3/4 percent of GDP. Combined with the decline in the social security surplus due to population aging, the overall government deficit is projected to deteriorate by.1 l/4 percent of GDP during F'Y 1997-2000 to reach 4 percent of GDP. a Long-term prospects. The fiscal position would continue to deteriorate beyond 2000 due to population aging and rising debt- servicing payments. Updating last year's staff analysis (see SM/94/167, Supplement 1) to include the effects of pension reform, tax reform, and the lo-year public investment plan suggests that new measures amounting to 4 percent of GDP would now be needed to put the fiscal position on a sustainable long-run footing.

While the ultimate loss on problem loans is likely to be significantly less than their total value, the problem is large, both in relation to banks' assets and to GDP. Furthermore, the recent decline in stock prices has sharply reduced the scope for writing-off bad loans by realizing hidden profits on equities. 1/ It does not appear, however, that the current weakness of the recovery can be directly attributed to financial sector problems. While bank intermediation spreads have widened, their current level appears to be consistent with normal cyclical developments; also, business surveys suggest that banks are willing to lend. Nevertheless, the slow pace in resolving the bad loan problem is a source of concern: it heightens the vulnerability of the financial sector to systemic. risk; undermines confidence in economic prospects; and limits the scope for a future strengthening of the recovery. At the same time, there is strong opposition to using public money to resolve the issue, as witnessed by the difficulties encountered in implementing a plan to take over two failed Tokyo credit cooperatives earlier this year. At the time of the discussions, MOF officials emphasized that the approach of encouraging institutions to make their own efforts to write off loans through operating profits had been successful and remained appropriate. In early June, the authorities announced a new package that included: stating conditions under which funds may be provided through the BOJ and the Deposit Insurance Corporation (DIC) to ailing institutions; encouraging bank mergers; reviewing measures to restructure housing loan corporations; improving disclosure; and enhancing supervision. While the package, for the most part, does not contain specific new proposals, its announcement represents a welcome recognition of the u Excluding trust accounts. 2/ Based on estimated restructured loans of about YlO trillion. v Hidden reserves declined from Y20 l/4 trillion at end-March 1994, when the Nikkei 225 index stood at 19,112, to Y8 l/2 trillion at end-March 1995, with a Nikkei of 16,139.

Several measures appear appropriate. Steps to accelerate the writing-down of the banks' problem loans and disposal of the CCPC's assets are needed--including encouraging loan securitization, liberalizing provisions for tax deductions, and dealing decisively with the problems of the housing loan companies. The banks should'be urged to strengthen their capital base by issuing new equity and reducing dividend payouts. Disclosure requirements should be expanded and made more consistent across institutions. The financial resources of the DIC should be increased, and a more flexible policy adopted toward their use. u (It its difficult for the staff, however, to assess the ultimate cost of resolving the problem and the need for public funds, given the unavailability of the relevant data.) Finally, changes to accounting standards and practices that would value assets and liabilities at market prices are needed to increase transparency. 4. Structural reform and trade ~olicv The Government has introduced a series of plans aimed at structural reform and deregulation over the past several years. The most recent, to be implemented over a five-year period, was announced at end-March. Among other things, it included a review of the large scale retail stores law, deregulation of oil imports, simplification of import inspections, and a realignment of product standards with international norms. Measures to strengthen the Fair Trade Commission are also to be reviewed. However, the plan was received unfavorably in financial markets because of its long implementation period and lack of specificity. As a result, in mid-April, the implementation period was accelerated to three years, and some measures were made more concrete. The authorities regarded the steps that had been taken as being quite ambitious --they would remove the vast majority of restrictions for which there was little current justification. They believed that there was, for the most part, an identifiable rationale for most remaining regulations. Further actions would have to balance the benefits of reform against the possible social and economic costs of removing these regulations. The staff welcomed the continuation of the reform process. At the same time, the staff noted that the benefits from reform would derive, not from the process itself, but from its results. Successfully meeting the challenges in this area would both raise longer-term growth prospects and ensure that growth was fully translated into higher living standards. In this context, the staff expressed concern that the reform plan was not sufficiently ambitious--core areas where the gains from action could be greatest had not been addressed. In particular, the staff urged the authorities to reduce the Government's role in the supply and distribution of agricultural products, deregulate the telecommunications sector, lJ The assets of the DIC are currently about Y850 billion, less than l/4 percent of bank deposits.

On trade policy, the authorities viewed the outcome of some bilateral discussions with the United States as having enhanced access toI Japan's markets on a basis consistent with multilateral trading principles. u They believed, however, that demands for increased "voluntary" targets for purchases of foreign auto parts by Japanese manufacturers were a private- sector issue and not a matter for government negotiations--any decision by the private sector to purchase more parts from abroad should be based on market principles. The approach to trade negotiations with the,European Union was regarded as very constructive: sectors were first identified on both sides where access problems might exist, and the situation was then explored in more detail through joint review. The staff noted the risk that bilateral negotiations on a sector-by- sector basis could lead to pressures for market-sharing arrangements that ultimately reduce competition. Thus, it was in Japan's interest to enhance market access through measures to reduce nontransparent barriers to trade, with benefits available to all partners. Indeed, resistance to "nonmarket" solutions to trade frictions heightened the need to enhance access on a multilateral basis. Japan should also push forward the process of removing visible barriers to trade, for instance by reducing agricultural protection and lowering tariff peaks in the manufacturing sector. Any pressures for protection from sectors adversely affected by yen appreciation would also need to be firmly resisted. Japan's role as the world's largest provider of financial assistance to developing countries continues to be widely appreciated, and the steps taken in early June to adjust the terms applied to ODA lending are welcome. The staff advocated more frequent review of the terms of official lending--which had not been adjusted since 1991-- to avoid unintended declines in concessionality in periods of falling interest rates. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month cycle. 1/ Agreement has been reached in the following areas: insurance and other financial services; flat glass; and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 31 - (As of May 31, 1995) I. uers& Stat=: Joined B/13/52; Article VIII II.
