Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with St. Kitts and Nevis were held in Basseterre and Charlestovn during February 15-March 2. The representatives of St. Kitts and Nevis included the Prime Minister (and Minister of Finance); the Premier of Nevis; economic ministers; and other senior officials. u Mr. Rainford. Advisor to the Executive Director for St. Kitts and Nevis, participated in the discussions. St. Kitts and Nevis accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sec- tions 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement in December 1984. St. Kitts and Nevis shares a common currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, with the other seven member countries of the ECCB and its exchange system is free of restrictions on current international transactions. The previous Article IV consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis, which is held on the 24-month cycle, was concluded by the Executive Board on June 23, 1993 (EBM/93/87 and EBM/93/88). u On that occasion, Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent economic policies. fi=Y observed that a further strengthening of public sector savings would be required to carry out the Government's medium-term investment program. After the general election in November 1993, the ruling party won a mi- nority of seats but secured the support of a smaller political party to con- tinue in office. Following civil unrest around end-1993 and again during August-November 1994, it was agreed to hold another general election by November 15. 1995. II. Recent Economic Develouments 1. Backsround St. Kitts and Nevis has been dependent historically on sugar production and exports for employment and foreign exchange earnings--under preferential arrangements with the European Union (EU) and the United States. Since the mid-1980s. however, it has diversified into tourism, export-oriented light manufacturing, and nonsugar agriculture for the tourism sector. In recent years, real GDP has grown strongly, inflation has been low, and the external position has been favorable (Chart 1 and Table 1). However, the economy continues to be vulnerable to external shocks. u The staff representatives were Messrs. Itam, Nyawata, and Verhoeven (EP), Ms. Yang and Mrs. Jacome (Assistant) (all WHD). Three staff members of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB)--which is headquartered in St. Kitts and Nevis--and a staff member of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) also joined the mission. 2/ Relations with the Fund are described in Appendix I.

Despite the civil unrest, tourism and related activities continued to expand strongly. Manufacturing output rose moderately, with further pen- etration of export markets for electronic components, and construction ac- tivity rebounded because of higher public sector investment. Sugarcane pro- duction rose in 1993 but a drought and the civil unrest resulted in lower output in 1994. Inflation declined from an average of 3 l/2 percent in 1991-92 to an average of 2 percent in 1993-94, largely because of increased supplies of agricultural produce for domestic consumption and the stabilization of import prices; the 12-month inflation rate fell to 1 l/2 percent by end- 1994. Selected price controls remain in place but have not been enforced. IJ The public finances shifted from a surplus of 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1991-92 to an average deficit of l/2 percent of GDP in 1993-94 (Table 2). u Public sector savings increased from 6 percent of GDP in 1991-92 to 7 percent of GDP in 1993-94, while public sector investment rose from an average of 4 l/2 percent of GDP in 1991-92 to 7 l/2 percent of GDP in 1993-94. The rise in investment reflected faster implementation of projects by both the Central Government and public enterprises, financed largely by foreign loans. The overall deficit of the Central Government narrowed from 2 percent of GDP in 1991-92 to about 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1993-94, as government savings increased faster than investment. Total revenue and grants rose by 2 percentage points to en average of 25 l/2 percent of GDP in 1993-94 owing to a major effort to strengthen tax administration in this period. At the same time, total expenditure relative to GDP rose from 25 l/2 percent in 1991-92 to 27 percent in 1993-94, largely because of sizeable wage increases and spending associated with the restoration of law and order following the civil unrest. The nonfinancial public enterprises' overall surplus declined from 3 l/2 percent of GDP in 1991-92 to 1 percent of GDP in 1993-94, because of increased investment. However, the overall surplus of the Social Security Scheme increased further from 4 percent of GDP in 1991-92 to 4 l/2 percent of GDP in 1993-94 reflecting faster growth in contributions relative to benefit payments. Monetary policy is conducted by the regional Central Bank, ECCB, in consultation with member governments. The ECCB is guided mainly by the objectives of containing inflation and maintaining adequate foreign exchange cover for its liabilities; the Central Bank's foreign assets were equivalent L/ The controls are administered mostly on the basis of maximum mark-ups on imported food items and building materials. u St. Kitts and Nevis has no military expenditure. Expenditure on local police is reflected fully in the fiscal, debt, and balance of payments data.

In St. Kitts and Nevis, the growth of bank liabilities to the private sector (broad money) slowed from 15 percent in 1992 to 12 l/2 percent in 1993 (Table 3), reflecting a shift of financial savings from bank deposits to treasury bills which carried higher yields. The slowdown in the growth of broad money became more pronounced in 1994 as the shift continued toward nonbank instruments--including deposits with nonbank financial institutions. Credit to the private sector expanded in line with economic activity, but commercial banks remained relatively liquid as a result of large loan repayments by the Central Government and increases in deposits by the Social Security Scheme. The net international reserves of the banking system increased by the equivalent of about 3 percent of broad money in 1993. However, they fell by 2 percent in 1994 as a commercial bank borrowed from its head office abroad to make a large loan for the construction of a port facility for cruise ships. Partly as a result of the liquidity situation of the banks and in reflection of a 1 percentage point reduction in the Central Bank's rediscount rate, average bank lending rates declined from 11 percent in 1991-92 to 10 percent in 1993-94. Deposit rates declined by a similar magnitude, and the spread between banks' lending and deposit rates remained unchanged at about 5 percentage points. The balance of payments recorded a cumulative surplus of US$4 l/2 mil- lion (2 percent of GDP) in 1993-94 (Table 4). The external current account deficit widened from e recent low of 7 percent of GDP in 1992 to 12 l/2 per- cent of GDP e year in 1993-94. The value of exports declined slightly as gains in the sales of electronic products were more than offset by a decline in sugar exports, while imports rose on account of increased tourism and construction activity. The capital account remained in substantial surplus, reflecting large private capital inflows including foreign direct invest- ment The imputed net official international reserves of St. Kitts and Nevis in the ECCB rose to the equivalent of about three months of imports of goods and nonfactor services at end-1994. St. Kitts and Nevis maintained a prudent external borrowing policy in the past two years and total outstanding public debt is estimated to have increased to US$45 million (22 percent of GDP) at end-1994. compared with US$42 million at end-1992 (Table 5). Until recently, almost all official external loans were obtained on concessional terms from the Caribbean Development Bank, the World Bank and bilateral creditors. L/ The external debt service has been fairly constant at around 4 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services. L/ St. Kitts and Nevis was graduated from the soft-loan window of the World Bank in 1994. Relations with the World Bank Group and the CDB are summarized in Appendices III and IV, respectively.

Measured for St. Kitts and Nevis, the Eastern Caribbean dollar appreciated by about 4 percent in reel effective terms in 1993, but depreciated by 3 percent in 1994, reflecting the movement of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis other major currencies (Chart 2). III. n the Discussions Re art o D The discussions with the authorities focused on measures to sustain low inflation end strong growth (projections for the main economic indi- cators are presented in Table 6). The authorities noted the importance of diversification of economic activity in view of the limited prospects for sugarcane end related activities. Their broad strategy for achieving these goals cells for the private sector to take the leading role. The public sector would provide the necessary infrastructure support, while maintaining sound environmental policies. This strategy will require continued fiscal efforts to raise public sector savings, wage restraint to maintain international competitiveness, and the removal of distortions in the allocation of resources. The economic prospects for 1995 are favoreble. Reel GDP growth is projected et about 5 percent based on a further growth in tourism end public investment in infrastructure. Inflation is expected to be around 3 percent. The balance of payments surplus in 1995 is projected to remain virtually unchanged from 1994 et US$l/Z million, es a slight widening of the external current account deficit would reflect externally financed infrastructure projects. For the medium term, the authorities are seeking to lower the annual rate of inflation to 1 l/2 percent end to maintain the growth of reel GDP et close to 5 percent a year. The public finances are projected to improve with the overall position reverting to surplus in 1998 following the comple- tion of major infrastructure projects. The imputed gross international reserves are targeted to be maintained at a level of around three months of imports of goods end nonfactor services, end the debt burden would remain manageable. 1. Fiscal oolicv The overall deficit of the public sector is projected to widen by 1 percentage point of GDP to about 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995, mainly because of increased spending on capital projects financed largely by foreign assistance. Public sector savings are projected to increase to around 8 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995 reflecting further improvements in tax administration, an increase in fees by the Air end See Port Authority, end continued large operational surpluses of the Social Security Scheme. The overall deficit of the Central Government is projected to widen by slightly more then 1 percentage point of GDP to almost 3 percent of GDP.

The government wage bill is expected to rise at a slower pace than GDP. The overall surplus of the public enterprises would increase slightly to 1 l/2 percent of GDP. The authorities explained that fiscal policy for 1995 and over the medium term would seek to provide the public sector savings needed as counterpart funds for foreign financed infrastructure projects, and to avoid undue cuts in public investment following the graduation of St. Kitts and Nevis from the soft-loan window of the World Bank as well as to permit some reduction in domestic debt. u Accordingly, public sector savings would need to be raised from 7 percent of GDP a year during 1992-94 to about 8 l/2 percent of GDP a year over the medium term. Public sector investment is expected to rise from 7 l/2 percent of GDP in the past two years to around 10 percent of GDP during 1995-97 before falling back to 6 percent of GDP during 1998-2000 following the completion of major projects. u Specific projects include the ongoing expansion of the port facility for cruise ships, the expansion of the airports, the planned enlargement of the electricity generating capacity, the development of the water and sewerage system, and the construction and rehabilitation of roads. The mission noted that both containment of current expenditure and stronger revenue performance were required to achieve the necessary improvement in public sector savings. To contain current expenditure, particular attention needed to be given to reducing the growth of the wage bill, which accounted for 53 percent of current expenditure and 48 percent of total revenue and grants in 1993-94. 2/ While acknowledging that it might be necessary for the public sector to increase wages to attract and retain qualified staff, the mission emphasized the importance of relating wage adjustments to performance and streamlining the civil service with a view to reducing its size and increasing its efficiency. 4/ In this regard, the mission welcomed the ongoing public administration review--with the assistance of the University of the West Indies--as an essential first step. The authorities also should examine the u St. Kitts and Nevis' domestic debt relative to GDP was 32 percent in 1994. the highest among ECCB member countries. u See Medium Term (1994-96) Economic Strateev Pauer for St. Kitts and w prepared by the authorities with assistance from the World Bank. 1/ These ratios are 3-4 percentage points higher than the average for the other ECCB member countries. &/ As noted in the previous consultation report, salaries in the private sector are about double those in the public sector but job security and nonpecuniary benefits in the public sector compensate at least in part for the difference (SM/93/110, 5/19/93).

To improve revenue performance--revenues averaged about 25 l/2 percent of GDP in 1993-94 compared with 29 percent of GDP for the other ECCB member countries--the mission recommended an overhaul of property tax assessments to bring them closer to market values and a reduction in customs duty exemptions. The latter could be implemented as import duty rates are being reduced in line with the common external tariff (CET) of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). 1/ In addition, the mission suggested that the tax system be simplified to make it more transparent and easier to administer, including through the elimination of several "nuisance taxes". The authorities were in general agreement with the mission's recommendations about the measures to raise government savings. m*Y emphasized that their main concern related to the continued fiscal burden resulting from the difficulties being experienced by the state-owned St. Kitts Sugar Manufacturing Corporation (SSKC). Even though a management firm was. engaged in 1991 to restructure and streamline its operations, the SSMC would not be able to compete in the international sugar market over the medium term without the protection now provided under existing trading arrangements (with the European Union and the United States) and government subsidies. 2/ The mission recommended that further measures be taken to reduce the operating costs of the company and that efforts to divest it be renewed. 2. Monetar e The authorities emphasized that the monetary and exchange rate arrangements associated with membership in the Eastern Caribbean monetary union continued to be appropriate for St. Kitts and Nevis. Broad money is projected to increase by 7 percent in 1995, somewhat slower than GDP. Net foreign financing is expected to exceed the public sector deficit, which will lead to a further increase in the net creditor position of the public 1/ Import duties were changed from O-45 percent to 5-30 percent in July 1993, except for a few agricultural and medical-care goods which remain at 40 percent and zero, respectively. The maximum import duty rate is expected to be reduced to 25 percent in July 1995 and the final tariff band of O-20 percent will be adopted in January 1998. u Under the arrangements, St. Kitts and Nevis can export to (i) the European Union (mainly the United Kingdom) up to 16.500 tons a year of domestically produced raw sugar at the price of Ecu 535 (equivalent to about US$670) per metric ton; and (ii) the United States an amount and at a price determined annually (the quota for October 1994-September 1995 is 8,468 metric tons and the price is US$380 per metric ton). The current free market price is about US$295 per metric ton and the production level at which the operations of SSMC would break even at the protected prices (EU and United States) is 28,000 metric tons.

This outturn would provide room for a significant expansion of credit to the private sector. .Discussions in the monetary area focussed on issues relating to the efficiency of financial intermediation. The authorities shared the mission's concern about the large spread between deposits and lending rates, observing that this was the situation in most of the ECCB member countries. They explained that the large spread resulted from the relatively high cost of operating banks in a small market. The Central Bank is using moral suasion to encourage commercial banks in the region to reduce their costs and to narrow the rate spreads. The mission recommended that the ECCB's minimum interest rate requirement on banks' saving deposits be removed because it contributed to high lending rates. The authorities indicated that the ECCB would review this requirement with the regional governments in connection with the efforts of the ECCB to develop a regional capital market. In 1993-94 the ECCB continued to provide facilities for commercial banks to place short-term funds and operate in the interbank market. In addition, the ECCB is in the process of establishing a home mortgage bank, a venture capital company, and a stock market in the region. In recent years, nonbank financial institutions have emerged, which has helped increase competition in the financial market. These institutions are licensed to take term deposits and extend certain consumer loans but regulations governing them are different from those applicable to commercial banks. The mission urged the authorities to maintain close supervision of the nonbank institutions. The authorities indicated that in addition to close monitoring, the Central Bank will enforce compliance with capital and prudential reserve requirements by these institutions. 3. Waae and urice Dolicies The authorities indicated that public sector wages would be restrained in line with the objective of maintaining low inflation, and would reflect productivity gains. They noted that the most recent wage increase granted to civil servants (15 percent in 1993) reflected the need to compete with the private sector to attract qualified staff; this increase was after four years, although a one-month salary bonus was granted in two of these years. The policy of wage restraint would continue to be supported by a flexible immigration policy for sectors facing labor shortages. The mission stressed that maintenance of competitiveness depended crucially on wage restraint, and expressed concern that the recent extension of minimum wage legislation to additional categories of workers may affect competitiveness adversely and create rigidities in the labor market. In response, the authorities indicated that recent labor disturbances had prompted this change as a step toward e universal minimum wage. The mission recommended that administrative controls of prices--even though not enforced--be abolished, because of their potential adverse Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - consequences for resource allocation and investment. The authorities plan to review price controls with the aim of eliminating them over the medium term. 4. Poverty and social ~r~erams The authorities restated their assessment that inequalities in the distribution of income are not particularly pronounced in St. Kitts and Nevis. Nevertheless, there are social programs (including job training) designed to alleviate poverty and ameliorate possible adverse effects of structural adjustment on the disadvantaged groups. The mission noted the importance of ensuring that such programs are cost effective and targeted appropriately. 5. Environmental Drotection The main environmental problems in St. Kitts and Nevis relate to deforestation and hillside soil erosion. The authorities emphasized that the Government was committed to the protection of the environment as crucial for achieving sustainable economic development. In this regard, steps were taken recently to monitor projects for their effects on the environment, particularly with regard to tourism. 6. Statistical issues There are statistical deficiencies in many areas that hamper the analysis of developments and weaken the basis for policy decisions. u The mission urged the authorities to take steps, including the use of external technical assistance, to improve the statistical base, especially in the areas of trade, fiscal and national accounts. 2/ The authorities indicated that efforts were being made to address the statistical deficiencies and will be contacting relevant multilateral institutions for assistance. IV. Medium-Term Outlook The medium-term outlook for the economy of St. Kitts and Nevis appears favorable on the basis of present policies and the Government's commitment to take steps to raise the necessary savings in support of the public investment program and to reduce distortions to help improve resource allocation (Chart 3 and Table 6). The external current account deficit is projected to narrcw to an average of about 11 percent of GDP in the medium 1/ Appendix V summarizes these issues. The quality and timeliness of data provision to the Fund need to be improved but these deficiencies reflect institutional weaknesses--including lack of trained personnel. Data provided to the Fund can be published. u An STA technical assistance mission to the ECCB in the areas of balance of payments and monetary statistics is scheduled for early 1996.

Net capital inflows are assumed to rise from en average of 11 l/2 per- cent of GDP in 1993-94 to 13 percent of GDP in 1997-98 reflecting a pick up in externally financed infrastructural projects and a rise in private capital inflows (including direct investment mainly from nationals abroad). A modest decline in net capital inflows is expected in the letter pert of the projection period, following the completion of major infrastructure projects. On this basis, the imputed international reserves of St. Kitts and Nevis with the ECCB are expected to remain at around three months of imports of goods end nonfactor service over the medium term. Although the debt/GDP ratio is projected to rise from 21 l/2 percent in 1994 to 30 percent in 2000, reflecting the pick up in disbursements of long- term foreign loans for infrastructure projects, it will remain one of the lowest in the region. The debt service ratio will decline somewhat from 4 percent in 1994 to less then 3 l/2 percent in 2000 because of an improve- ment in the maturity structure of public external debt. The downside risks to these projections (apart from any external shocks) relate to a possible failure of the public sector to generate the necessary savings to realize the public investment program. Furthermore, civil disturbances could undermine the confidence of the private sector with adverse effects on investment (particularly in the tourism sector). In such a scenario the external accounts would weaken, and reel GDP growth would be substantially lower than in the base line scenario. V. Staff Auuraisal St. Kitts and Nevis' economic performance has continued to be broadly satisfactory in recent years. Reel GDP grew by about 4 percent a year in 1993-94, es tourism and construction expended, end inflation remained et around 2 percent a year. The external current account deficit widened from 7 percent of GDP in 1992 to 12 l/2 percent of GDP a year in 1993-94 reflecting externally financed infrastructure projects. However, large capital inflows associated with these projects in addition to direct investment more than offset the external current account deficit. The authorities seek to raise the annual rate of growth of real GDP to close to 5 percent in 1995 and over the medium term, and to contain inflation to 3 percent in 1995 end 1 l/2 percent a year in the subsequent years. They believe that the diversification and expansion of economic activity should be led by the private sector. The public sector would be limited to e supporting role, mainly through prudent economic policies end adequate provision of infrastructure. The authorities also aim at keeping the external debt burden manageable and maintaining international reserves Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - at a level equivalent to three months of imports of goods and nonfactor services. The authorities have adopted an appropriate strategy for the achieve- ment of these macroeconomic objectives. Their perseverance in the pursuit of prudent fiscal policy and development of the infrastructure in the past several years provide confidence in the country's medium-term prospects. Achievement of the objectives will require that public savings are raised to support the envisaged level of public investment, including provision of counterpart funds for externally financed projects. The authorities should aim to increase public savings relative to GDP from 7 percent in 1994 to 8 l/2 percent a year in the near to medium term. To this end, the authorities will need to raise domestic revenue through overhauling property tax assessments to bring them closer to market values, reducing import duty exemptions, and improving tax administration. Current expenditure also should be restrained, with particular emphasis on the containment of the government wage bill. In this regard, the staff welcomes the ongoing public administration review as an essential first step. The authorities also should re-examine ways to reduce government transfers end subsidies to raise domestic savings. The staff would encourage the authorities to renew their efforts to divest the state-owned SSMC. A more vigorous implementation of infrastructure projects and the removal of factors that could create economic distortions--such as the system of price controls end the required minimum interest rate on saving deposits--will help to foster conditions for a more robust private sector. The authorities are encouraged to eliminate these controls et an early stage. They also need to be wary of the effects that extending the minimum wage could have on competitiveness end the smooth functioning of the labor market. In this regard, the staff notes the intention of the authorities to maintain a flexible immigration policy for sectors facing labor shortages. The monetary end exchange rate arrangements of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank have helped foster financial stability and low inflation in St. Kitts and Nevis. The staff concurs with the authorities' view that this arrangement has served the country well and remains appropriate. However, efforts should be made to ensure that nonbank financial intermediaries are supervised adequately. In view of the recent satisfactory performance of the economy and the favorable outlook for 1995 and the medcum term, the staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with St. Kitts end Nevis continue to be held on the 24-month cycle.

Real sector Data on the national accounts are reported to the Fund (STA) with some lag. Data on value added are available through 1993 and on expenditure through 1992. The weights for national accounts compilation in constant prices (1977) may have become outdated and the coverage of some sectors (particularly manufacturing) may be insufficient. Data on wages, employment, and production (except for those of the sugar industry) are incomplete because of insufficient coverage. b. Government fw Government finance data follow the national presentation and need to be adjusted by STA to generate GFS tables. Data reported by the Accountant General's office and public enterprises on external debt and balances with the banking system are inconsistent with those reported by the ECCB and the External Debt Unit of the Ministry of Finance. c. Balance of uwments Trade data are reported by the Statistical Office with a substantial lag and are inconsistent with those reported by the ECCB in the balance of payments.
