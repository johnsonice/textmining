Introductim Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation were held in Quito during the period March 9-23. 1995, against the backdrop of financial market uncertainties in the aftermath of the Mexican crisis and the border conflict with Peru in January and February. The Ecuadoran representatives included the Ministers of Finance, Planning, Agriculture, Energy, Industry, Labor, Public Works, Social Welfare, and Defense; the President of the Monetary Board; the General Manager of the Central Bank: and other senior government officials. The mission comprised Messrs. Neuhaus (Head), Schwidrowski (both WHD), Rado (FAD), Mrs. Prowse (PDR), and Ms. Silman (Assistant-WHD), and was assisted by Mr. Escobar, the Fund's resident representative.in Ecuador. The previous Article IV consultation with Ecuador was concluded on May 11, 1994 (EBH/94/42). at which time the Executive Board also approved Ecuador's request for a 22-month stand-by arrangement in an amount equiv- alent to SDR 130 million (32 percent of quota OR an annual basis). On that occasion, Directors commended the authorities for the improvement in eco- nomic performance since the Government took office in August 1992, and wel- comed the authorities' intention to continue with the adjustment effort. Executive Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation and structural reform, supported by wage and credit restraint, were key to redress macro- economic imbalances and improve the country's growth prospects. On November 21, 1994 the Board approved (on a lapse-of-time basis) a request for the release of set-asides for the debt- and debt-service- reduction (DDSR) operation with Ecuador's commercial creditors together with augmentation of access in support of that operation in an amount of SDR 43.9 million (20 percent of quota). Fund credit outstanding to Ecuador at end- March 1995 amounted to SDR 131.2 million (59.8 percent of quota) (Appendix I). The mission discussed policies for the second review of the arrange- ment, but it is not proposed to complete the review pending the adoption of policy measures, as described below. II. $ The program for 1994-95 targeted a reduction in inflation from 31 per- cent during 1993 to 20 percent in 1994 and 12 percent in 1995, and a gain in international reserves of US$575 million in 1994-95 to be used in part to finance the DDSR operation. Output was assumed to rise by around 3 percent in 1994 and 4 percent in 1995 (Table 1). The fiscal deficit (including quasi-fiscal central bank operations) would rise only marginally to 0.5 per- cent of GDP in 1994 despite a decline in oil revenue, and a surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP was targeted for 1995. Fiscal discipline was to be supported by appropriate credit, wage, and exchange rate policies, struc- tural reforms, and the normalization of relations with external creditors. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public2 Performance criteria for 1994 were met with margins (Table 2). There was a" overall fiscal surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP, owing to a higher than projected quasi-fiscal surplus of the Central Bank and a lower deficit of the nonfinancial public sector (Table 3 and Chart 1). The overperformance of the nonfinancial public sector resulted from a compression of "onwage government outlays, which more than offset shortfalls in oil receipts and in the operating surplus of public enterprises stemming from weaker fuel sales and receipts from international telephone calls. In spite of higher than expected imports, tax collections were 0.2 percent of GDP lower than pro- jected because of a shortfall in taxes on domestic transactions, owing in part to delays in implementing steps to strengthen tax administration. The authorities had intended to restrain public wage outlays and pursue a forward-looking wage policy for the private sector (through its represen- tation on the tripartite sectoral commissions). HOWeVer, the public sector wage bill exceeded the level envisaged in the program by 0.6 percent of GDP in 1994 owing to higher general wage increases and job reclassifications (increases were particularly high for military and local government personnel). Compensation for unskilled private workers went up by 56 per- cent in 1994; the increases for higher income workers were smaller but likely exceeded targeted inflation. I/ Central bank "et domestic assets declined by more than programmed in 1994, but currency issue rose by 36 percent (23 percent in the program), accompanied by a stronger than projected balance of payments outcome (Table 4). At the same time, a sharp increase in the availability of loanable funds (reflecting capital repatriation and increases in remunerated bank deposits) fueled a rapid expansion in banking system credit to the private sector, particularly for housing and consumption. In the first quarter of 1995, central bank net domestic assets expanded by about 0.6 per- cent of GDP owing to the drawdown of public sector deposits related to the border conflict with Peru, and this expansion was reflected in a drop in international reserves of about US$lZO million. The 12-month rate of inflation only declined from 31 percent in 1993 to 25 percent in December 1994 and 23 percent in March 1995. Output grew by 4 percent in 1994, led by activity in the mining, construction, and financial sectors. The sucre depreciated by 13 percent vis-8-vis the U.S. dollar in 1994, substantially less than the inflation differential with respect to indus- trial countries. However, in real effective terms the currency was about unchanged because of the weakening of the U.S. dollar vis-h-vis other key currencies: in the first two months of 1995 the sucre appreciated by about 1 percent in real effective terms (Chart 2). 1/ According to the latest information from the Census Bureau (INEC), during the last quarter of 1994 real wages of unskilled workers were about 40 percent higher than the average in 1991.92.

This reflected higher interest accruals on account of the delay in completion of the DDSR operation until early 1995 and an upward revision in the data series for imports going back to 1987. u The value of non-oil exports rose by 33 percent in 1994, buoyed by increases in the volume of bananas and seafood products and higher coffee prices. Import values rose by 32 percent continuing the strong growth of recent years. In the capital account, foreign direct investment (especially for oil exploration and development) was significantly higher than projected, and other private capital inflows reflected an increase in trade credits and short-term inflows possibly moti- vated by interest rate differentials. Net international reserves increased by US$460 million in 1994 or by US$220 million more than envisaged in the program. In early 1995, the authorities moved quickly in the wake of the finan- cial crisis in Mexico and the conflict with Peru. Interest rates were raised sharply (as the Central Bank did not seek to offset the liquidity squeeze originated by the depositors' temporary shift toward holding cur- rency) (Charts 3 end 4); civilian public outlays were curtailed; a one-time levy on motor vehicles and a wage tax equivalent to two days of salary were imposed, yielding 0.3 percent of GDP; and in mid-February the exchange rate band (which has a width of 4 percent) was depreciated by 3 percent vis-B-vis the U.S. dollar. Despite a drawdown of reserves for military procurement in early 1995, there was a gain of US$130 million in net international reserves from mid-December (i.e., prior to the Mexican crisis) to late-ApriI 1995, and gross reserves are now USS1.9 billion or around five months of imports of goods and nonfactor services. Interest rates have fallen somewhat since the end of the border conflict as private agents rebuilt their bank depos- its, but the Central Bank has continued to restrict credit (as evidenced by an increase in placements of open market paper from end-January to mid-April 1995). There has been no pronounced shift in the maturity or currency composition of external public debt, and the stock of short-term external public obligations is small. III. Policv Discussions The authorities expressed satisfaction with the economy's performance in 1994, as evidenced by the decline in inflation, a buildup of interna- tional reserves, and the recovery of economic activity. Investor confidence also had been bolstered by the regularfzation of arrangements wfth creditors (through the Paris Club "exit" rescheduling of June 1994 2/ and completion 1/ The statistical revision recently completed by the Central Bank suggests that previous official estimates understated the current account deficit by an average of 1 percent of GDP a year during the period 1990.94. Z-/ All bilateral Paris Club agreements have been signed, except with the United Kingdom where agreement on the interest rate on ODA loans is pending Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 4 - of the DDSR operation with external commercial creditors in February 1995). The authorities stressed that Ecuador had proven to be somewhat less vulner- able than other countries in the region to the fallout from the Mexican crisis (owing in part to the incipient nature of domestic capital markets), and the quick policy response to the outbreak of the border conflict with Peru had helped to maintain calm in the foreign exchange market. Nevertheless, the authorities recognized that the adjustment effort needed to be intensified to correct for slippages that had emerged over the past several months, in particular in the fiscal area. To strengthen fiscal management, the new Minister of Finance appointed in early April was given a mandate to overhaul the operations of the Ministry and improve coordination with the rest of the economic team. Moreover, broad political support would be sought for the passage of key structural reforms, which had been side- tracked since the latter part of 1994 by discussions on a constitutional reform and the border conflict. At the same time, the authorities believe that, because of the effect of the Mexican crisis on financial markets in the region and the fiscal and other economic implications of the border dispute, it is no longer possible to achieve the macroeconomic targets for 1995 envisaged originally. Rather, they have begun to frame a program that is premised on fiscal balance and aims at lowering inflation to about 20 percent in 1995 and achieving output growth of around 3.5 percent. The mission agreed that under the circumstances. the authorities' revised fiscal objectives were broadly appropriate, and discussions focused on the specific policy actions required to meet these goals. At the same time, the mission noted that the official forecast for real GDP growth appeared optimistic because of the dislocations from the border conflict and the rise in interest rates early this year. Moreover, it recommended aiming for a somewhat faster decline in inflation than envisaged by the author- ities, preferably to 18 percent or less by end-1995. It was agreed that discussions for the second review under the stand-by arrangement would resume in Quito once the authorities identify measures to close the large fiscal gap that has emerged (see below). 1. Fiscal and wave policies In spite of substantial cutbacks in investment spending relative to the original budget and the imposition of the war-related levies mentioned above, in the absence of additional actions the fiscal deficit was projected to rise to 3.5-4 percent of GDP in 1995 (an indicative surplus of 0.5 per- cent of GDP was originally envisaged in the program). The fiscal pressures reflected: (i) additional military outlays on the order of 2 percent of GDP, and (ii) slippages totaling 1.5-2 percent of GDP stemming from pro- jected increases in civilian current outclays, delays in public tariff adjustments, and a shortfall in oil revenue owing to temporary pipeline and refinery bottlenecks. To reach fiscal balance, the authorities are preparing a broad-based package comprising (i) adjustments in electricity, telephone, and cooking Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 4a - CHART 3 ECUADOR SELECTED INTEREST RATES” 1 NOMINAL INTEREST RATES 50 REAL INTEREST RATES 40- Real lending rates (90 &YSl Hrol ywld 02, CDS Rd (:lom daysJ Cmhl Bank r(I1e ~ii’ l! 50 10 ,‘I._._~ ~~~~ ~~ -/-._- --,--~-I I’23, ,9!>,’ I !I!):/ 19124 ,!l!?!i JO ‘0 0 , ii) IO Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 4b - CHART 4 ECUADOR SELECTED FINANCIAL INDICATORS (Chues since mid-Deemher 1994) (In millions of U.S. dollers) 200 NET NONFIN.

The Government con- siders that replacing the general LPG subsidy by a targeted voucher scheme, which was to be an important measure in the program but was postponed sev- eral times in 1994, is not politically feasible at present. However, LPG may be added to the group of derivative products whose prices are adjusted monthly for exchange rate movements, so that the subsidy element will not rise over time. In the wake of the lackluster performance of domestic tax collections in 1994 (Statistical Appendix Table S), the authorities are seeking to intensify efforts to improve tax administration (with technical assistance from a resident FAD expert). In particular, they are taking steps to make the large taxpayers unit in Quito and Guayaquil fully operatlonal by June 1995, and they plan to submit to Congress by end-May legislation to close tax loopholes. As part of the overhaul of Ministry of Finance operations, the author- ities plan to intensify their efforts to strengthen expenditure control under terms of the 1992 Budget Reform Law, and to that end the Treasury and Budget Departments will be merged shortly. However, the goal of reducing earmarking of public revenue--a key tenet of the 1992 reform--has suffered a setback with the renewal early this year of the earmarking of about 5 per- cent of public sector oil revenue to the military (slated to lapse at end- 1994) for an additional 15 years. The authorities indicated that compensation policies for the civil service would be managed carefully in the period ahead in light of slippages that had occurred in the past several months. Basic salary increases in early 1995 had aimed at limiting the year-on-year growth of the wage bill to 15 percent. However, because of promotions in late 1994 and early 1995, the wage bill would rise by 32 percent in nominal terms (representing an increase of 0.2 percent of GDP in 1995) if the authorities were to grant the mid-year increase that had become customary in recent years. By contrast, freezing public salaries for the remainder of the year as recommended by the mission would save 0.5 percent of GDP in wage outlays in 1995 relative to the baseline. The mission also encouraged the authorities to seek moderation in private wage settlements. This could be accomplished by limiting adjust- ments in minimum wages and a greater effort on the part of government representatives in the tripartite labor commissions (which also include Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - representatives from business and labor) to gear wage increases to prospec- tive rather than past inflation. 1/ The public employment reduction program envisages separation of another 12,000 employees in 1995 (compared with 16,400 separations in 1994), with severance payments of 0.6 percent of GDP. Achievement of this goal would entail a cumulative reduction in civilian personnel of about 12 percent since the Administration took office in August 1992. 2. Public sector reforms In the structural area, the immediate steps envisaged by the author- ities are privatization of the state airline by June 1995; approval of the telecommunications reform bill u and the amendments to the central bank charter that are before Congress; and preparation by end-1995 of a social security reform bill (with assistance from the IDB) creating private pension funds and health maintenance organizations. The Government has granted private concessions for power generation and the operation of several highways, is negotiating terms for the expansion of the oil pipeline by private investors, and expects to privatize the operations of the port of Guayaquil. Proceeds from nonfinancial public sector asset sales would be rela- tively small in the foreseeable future (on the order of US$20 million in 1995 and US$120 million in 1996), and under a recent bill passed by Congress they would be earmarked to a Social Solidarity Fund. (The original program for 1994-95 had assumed asset sales of US$600 million in 1996-97 to be used for public sector debt buybacks under terms of the DDSR operations.) Hean- while, proceeds from minor sales of assets owned by official financial institutions would be used to recapitalize the National Development Bank (BNF) and the National Finance Corporation (CFN). 3. Social policies and the environment The authorities indicated that they would seek to protect public outlays for the social sectors. In this respect, the Government has been increasing transfers for local social programs, while fostering community involvement in labor-intensive programs sponsored by the Social Investment Fund (FISE) created in March 1993. The FISE has committed US$70 million in multilateral and bilateral resources to over 3,000 projects (of which one u Compensation for unskilled private workers was raised by 17 percent in January 1995 (another adjustment is likely in July) and the sectoral wage contracts agreed at the beginning of the year provide for increases of around 20 percent for the year as a whole. 2/ The plan is to sell 55 percent of the shares of the state telephone company (35 percent would be sold to a private operator with managerial control and another 20 percent to employees and local investors) and create a new regulatory body (CONATEL).

In the environmental area, the main initiatives were (i) implementing an agreement between PETROECUADOR and a foreign oil company to clean up oil spills in the Orient= region; (ii) requiring environment-friendly drilling techniques for all new oil fields; (iii) restricting the use of leaded gasoline; (iv) promoting reforestation and improvements in forestry manage- ment; and (v) tightening regulations to protect coastal wetlands. 4. Credit and financial sector uolicies The mission discussed the outlines of a credit program for 1995 prem- ised on timely adoption of the fiscal package described above, and consis- tent with a marked deceleration in the growth of the monetary aggregates. In response to the upsurge in interest rates in the early part of the year, there are indications that the growth of banking system credit to the private sector has slowed; a further slowdown is expected owing to the deceleration of output growth and the enforcement of tighter capital/asset requirements for financial institutions. 1/ Under the adjustment scenario discussed with the authorities, M2 would rise by 27 percent (compared with 52 percent in 1994) and net international reserves would increase by US$lOO- 150 million in 1995 (representing an increase of US$225-275 million from April to December 1995). The authorities indicated that despite the relatively high level of interest rates, no major troubles in the banking system were apparent so far. The Banking Board--created under the 1994 Financial Sector Reform Law to improve the sector's regulatory framework--had begun to operate in February 1995, and the authorities would continue to strengthen the Superin- tendency of Banks with assistance from the IDB. 5. Exchanee rate Policies and external outlook The authorities indicated that the system of preannouncing the exchange rate path through end-1995 within a narrow band (which had been introduced just before the start of the Mexican crisis) had proven resilient to subsequent shocks and had helped anchor expectations about inflation. They considered Ecuador's external competitiveness to be broadly appro- priate, and indicated that central bank intervention would continue to take place within a band of S/. 50 per U.S. dollar (currently equivalent to about 2 percent) on each side of a midpoint rate that would depreciate by about 15 percent during 1995, including the effect of the February step adjust- ment. The staff suggested that consideration should be given to widening the band somewhat to facilitate the achievement of the objectives of 1/ Since February 1995, institutions with a capital asset ratio below the legal minimum (9 percent) must deposit public sector securities at the Central Bank in an amount equivalent to the deficiency.

As envisaged under the program, in late 1994 the Central Bank reduced the spread between the buying and selling rates for transactions of the State oil company from S/. 180 per U.S. dollar (8 percent) to S/. 150 per U.S. dollar (about 6 percent). The spread for all other public sector transactions was reduced to 2 percent. The authorities confirmed that the multiple currency practices arising from the spread on PETROECUADOR's trans- actions in the official market (which has the fiscal purpose of reducing the spending capacity of the nonfinancial public sector) will be eliminated as planned by June 1995, in the light of the steps that have been taken to strengthen control on public expenditure. The staff projects a decline in the external current account deficit from just under 5 percent of GDP in 1994 to around 3 percent of GDP in 1995, assuming that policies are strengthened as planned and the increase in capi- tal inflows in the past few months abates during the year. Export volumes would grow somewhat faster in 1995 than in 1994 owing to a continued strong performance of nontraditional exports and a recovery of shrimp and processed cocoa volumes, which suffered setbacks last year. The growth of civilian imports would slow because of the deceleration of domestic activity. (BY contrast, if the needed fiscal measures are not adopted, the current account could widen significantly and there could be a loss in international reserves related to confidence factors and delays in policy-based multi- lateral lending.) The capital account would move from a deficit in 1994 to a surplus in 1995, owing to substantially higher official borrowing. Besides disburse- ments that have already taken place in connection with the DDSR operation, policy-based loans from the IBRD and IDB and further cofinancing from Japan's Export-Import Bank (JEXIM)--all premised on adequate macroeconomic policies--are expected in 1995 for a total of US$120 million. In addition, parallel financing with the Fund by JFXIH might be provided this year. u The system of minimum valuation prices for certain consumer good imports was dismantled in October 1994 ( except for automobile imports), and in February 1995 the common external tariff of the Andean Pact was imple- mented. Ecuador expects to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) later this year after completing bilateral negotiations with major trading partners. Upon WTO accession, the authorities have committed to a phased liberalization of farm protection; harmonization of safeguard and anti- dumping procedures with WTO norms; and unification of excise tax rates on domestic and imported goods. Benefits from UT0 membership are expected to accrue through productivity gains from increased foreign competition and a u For details on the financing of the DDSR operation see the Appendix on restructuring of commercial bank debt in the accompanying recent economic developments paper.

Ecuador and its Andean Pact partners expect to initiate discussions later this year on possible associa- tion with the MERCOSUR, and they will continue to press in international fora for liberalization of the EU's restrictions on banana imports. 6. Medium-term outlook The medium-term outlook developed at the time of the request for the stand-by arrangement indicated that achieving external viability was feasible, provided Ecuador implemented the policies envisaged in the program and alleviated the debt burden through rescheduling and DDSR operations. This a.ssessment has not changed significantly, and the revised staff pro- jections suggest that the current account position might even improve relative to the most recent medium-term outlook in EBS/94/214. For example, a more rapid increase in non-oil exports over the projection period--based on the recent strong export performance--would more than compensate for the losses from higher international interest rates and temporary bottlenecks in oil production capacity (owing to a delay in the expansion of the Trans- Ecuadoran oil pipeline, which is now expected to be completed in 1998 instead of 1996). HOWeVer, to secure the envisaged improvement in the external situation, the fiscal position would need to be stronger in 1996-99 than was thought when the original program was framed, to compensate for the deviation from the original assumptions for 1995 and significantly lower asset sales in 1995-96 than projected originally. With increased private participation in the energy and telecommunications sectors, public investment would be reduced gradually and redirected toward infrastructure and the social Sectors. Private savings would be bolstered by a reform of the social security system (including through creation of private pension funds), but this would be offset in part by lower public savings reflecting the fiscal cost of the transition to the new pension scheme. Output is assumed to grow by around 4 l/2 percent a year in the projection period (Table 6). On this basis, the external current account deficit would widen from 3 percent of GDP in 1995 to 4 percent in 1996.97 reflecting a rise in interest payments and in imports related to oil sector investment (Table 7). From 1996 onward, the current account deficit would be financed largely by foreign direct investment. With higher oil production after 1998 (permitted by the expansion of the pipeline), the deficit would decline subsequently to around 2 percent of GDP. The share of nontraditional exports in total exports would double to about 40 percent in the next decade. Import volumes (excluding those related to oil sector investment) would increase slightly fastel- than non-oil activity. Net official external borl-owing during the projection period would be relatively modest despite a recovery of ~multil;itcrnl ;illd bilaccl-al loall disbursements.

Other private capital inflows would continue at a modest pace throughout the period. Completion of the DDSR operation has lowered the public debt- and debt- service ratios substantially in 1995, and a further improvement is envisaged over the medium term. The external debt to GDP ratio would decline from about 70 percent at present to a" average of 46 percent early next century, while the debt-service ratio would be more than halved during the same period to 21 percent. Domestic public debt also would decline steadily from 1996 if the fiscal position is strengthened as suggested (see Table 6). Nevertheless, these ratios are still high by international standards. Fiscal surpluses would permit small debt-for-equity or buyback opera- tions during 1996-99. Gross reserves would rise through the end of the decade to around 6.5-7 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services, which would enable Ecuador to meet the increase in debt service on commer- cial debt early in the next century under the terms of the DDSR operation. Reserve coverage subsequently would decline to an average of about 5.5 months of imports in 2000-2005. The medium-term projections are sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices and international interest rates. A variation in the average export price of crude oil of US$l a barrel would change the current account deficit by a" average of 0.5 percent of GDP a year; a 1 percentage point increase in LIBOR would affect the current account deficit by a similar magnitude. 7. Statistical issues The mission encouraged the authorities to take immediate steps to improve the statistical data base, with a view to facilitating the design and implementation of policies and the timely monitoring of economic perfor- mance (see Appendix II). Priority areas are improving the coverage and timeliness of fiscal data; reducing the reporting lag in the consolidation of banking system accounts; and halting a deterioration in the timeliness and accuracy of national accounts data. IV. Staff Auuraisal The authorities' adherence in 1994 to the economic program supported by the current stand-by arrangement produced tangible improvements in economic performance: inflation has declined while output recovered, and there was a sizable buildup of international reserves. Underpinning these achievements was a shift of the public finances to a small surplus (compared with a deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP in the program), and the beginning of struc- tural reform. At the same time, Ecuador graduated from bilateral debt relief through a" "exit" rescheduling. and completed a DDSR operation with commercial creditors that permitted a" important reduction in the debt Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - burden and the elimination of arrears accumulated with commercial creditors since the previous rescheduling agreement in 1987. More recently, the authorities responded quickly to the challenges posed by the Mexican crisis and the economic repercussions of the border conflict with Peru. Nevertheless, performance has been disappointing in a number of areas. After the defeat of the Government in the May 1994 elections for Congress, the momentum of structural reforms slackened, the planned elimination of the cooking gas subsidy was abandoned, measures to improve tax administration were delayed, end the earmarking of part of public sector oil revenue to the military (slated to expire at end-1994) was renewed for another 15 years. Moreover, in the latter part of 1994 public spending began to rise at a rapid pace, adding pressures on the overall fiscal position. As a result, Ecuador's economic situation remains fragile. Inflation- ary pressures would be rekindled if fiscal policy is not brought back under control; the external debt burden remains heavy; the availability of foreign financing is limited in the wake of the Mexican crisis; and deficiencies in infrastructure end the social sectors remain to be addressed. Against this background, every effort needs to be made to bring the adjustment and reform program back on track as soon as feasible; meanwhile, it is not proposed to complete the second review of the stand-by arrangement pending implementation of corrective measures. The principal step in that direction would be the adoption of a broad-based package aimed et fiscal equilibrium or even a small surplus in 1995 (as envisaged in the original stand-by program). Emphasis should be placed on bolstering public sector revenue and curtailing wage outlays, which also would permit a recovery of spending for physical and human capital formation. In particular, the efforts to strengthen rax administration need to be revitalized, and tariffs for electricity, telephone, and cooking gas need to be adjusted promptly for both fiscal and efficiency reasons. The authorities also need to succeed in their efforts to regain the momentum of structural reforms. Key steps are the timely approval by Congress of legislation to permit increased private participation in the power and telecommunications sectors, reform the social security system, and amend the central bank charter to strengthen its autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy. The tightening of monetary policy has played a key role in responding to the recent external shocks, but it will be important to continue moderat- ing the expansion of bank credit to the private sector from the very rapid growth observed last year. At the same time, the persistence of unusually high real interest rates could undermine the soundness of the financial system. It is for these reasons that the staff would emphasize the impor- tance of strengthening fiscal policy to relieve the burden on monetary policy of safeguarding the objectives of the program. Every effort also should be made to strengthen bank supervision, including through timely Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public12 - audits and on-site inspections of financial institutions covering both domestic and offshore operations. Restrained financial policies need to be supported by moderation in wage settlements, Public sector wage outlays have risen by 0.6 percent of GDP in the pest four years, despite the implementation of en ambitious program of employment reduction, and the increase in private sector real wages in the past two years has outstripped gains in productivity. The proposed freeze in public wages for the remainder of 1995 would help correct for earlier slippages in this area, and should be accompanied by a highly selective policy on promotions. It also would be advisable to forego any mid-year increases in minimum wages in 1995 and explore ways to strengthen the enforcement of forward-looking guidelines for collective bargaining, in preparation for the next round of private sector wage negotiations in early 1996. The sure has remained approximately unchanged in real effective terms since the stand-by program was framed over a year ago, and the current practice of preannouncing a band for the exchange rate appears to have withstood well the recent exogenous shocks. Nevertheless, consideration should be given to a somewhat wider band in the interest of strengthening monetary control and safeguarding international competitiveness. The authorities are taking welcome steps to seek membership in the World Trade Organization and foster regional economic integration. Their efforts to maintain an outward-looking growth strategy would be facilitated by an open international trade regime, including for primary products. Ecuador maintains multiple currency practices arising from the spread between buying end selling rates in the official exchange market, end between these official rates and those in the free market. The spread between buying and selling rates in the official market constitutes a tax on nonfinancial public sector export receipts that has served to contain public expenditure. The authorities reduced the spread from 11 percent to 8 per- cent in early November 1994 and to 6 percent at end-1994, and are committed to eliminating the multiple currency practices by June 1995. In these circumstances, it is proposed to approve Ecuador's retention of the multiple currency practices until June 30, 1995. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The Fund takes this decision relating to Ecuador's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, in light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Ecuador conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance Over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Ecuador's multiple currency practices arising from the spread between buying and selling rates in the official market, and between these official rates and the free market rates, are subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) end 3. In view of Ecuador's intention to eliminate the multiple currency practices by June 1995. the Fund approves the retention by Ecuador of these multiple currency practices until June 30, 1995.

ExchanFe Rate Arranaement: On September 1, 1993 the authorities simplified the exchange regime by eliminating the intervention bands for private sector transac- tions and setting a selling exchange rate for public sector transac- tions linked to the interbank market rate during the previous week. At the same time, they have reduced the spread between the buying and selling exchange rates for transactions with the State oil company in steps from S/. 300 per U.S. dollar in September 1993 to S/. 150 per U.S. dollar in January 1995. For all other public sec- tor transactions, the spread was reduced to 2 percent in November 1994. In mid-December 1994, the Central Bank pre-announced a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - APPENDIX I nominal exchange rate path through end-1995. Central bank inter- vention is taking place to keep the acre within a band of S/. 50 per U.S. dollar on each side of a notional midpoint range that would depreciate by 15 percent during 1995. On February 16, the Central Bank devalued the mid-point exchange rate by 3 percent, and at end- March the central bank selling rate was S/. 2,417 per U.S. dollar. Article IV Consultation: The 1994 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on May 11, 1994 (EBM/94/42). Consultations with Ecuador are on the 12-month cycle. IX.

Real sector The timeliness and accuracy of national accounts data has deteriorated markedly over the past two years. There are no consistent time series on wage developments, and employment figures suffer from long lags. There is no reliable accounting of public sector employment. 2. Government finance Serious data shortcomings (mainly related to organizational problems within the Ministry of Finance) hamper a timely and accurate monitoring of fiscal data from "above the line". MOlXOVer, there are serious problems in reconciling transfer flows within the public sector, as well as with the coverage and timeliness of data for local and autonomous agencies and smaller public enterprises. The accuracy of figures from "below the line" would benefit substantially from a broader coverage of nonfinancial public sector floating debt (which currently only covers the Central Government) and improved reporting of public secfor bank deposits locally and abroad. Data published in the Fund's GFS Yearbook have a long lag; the last year covered is 1990 for the Budgetary Central Government. No data have been received on the operations of extrabudgetary accounts, social security funds, and the local government units. 3. Monetary accounts After recent changes in legislation that also included new reporting standards, reporting by commercial banks to the Superintendency of Banks and the Central Bank has slowed down considerably. This poses a serious problem for measuring monetary developments. Due to considerable off-shore banking operations, current efforts to include offshore branches in the reporting of consolidated banking statistics should be accelerated. The latest available data for the consolidated financial system are for December 1994. 4. External sector Trade data are reported with considerable lags, and efforts are needed to produce import data on a more timely basis. There is also an urgent need to improve the reporting of data on external private indebtedness. The Central Bank should provide more timely information, including systematic breakdowns of private debt by maturity, creditor, and debtor, and an effort should be made to produce quarterly or semi-annual balance of payments figures.
