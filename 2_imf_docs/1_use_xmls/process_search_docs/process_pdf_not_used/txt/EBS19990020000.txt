Acquah and Ishan Kapur November 5, 1999 l A mission visited Accra during September 2-16, 1999 to conduct the discussions on the 1999 Article IV consultation and first review of the current three-year arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). Ghana is on the standard 12-month Article. IV consultation cycle. l The mission met with Vice-President John Atta Mills; Minister of Finance, Kwame Peprah; the Governor of the Bank of Ghana, Mr. Kwabena Du%or; and other senior o&&ls. The. Executive Director for Ghana, Mr. Mirakhor, participated in the discussions. l The mission consisted of Mr. Pereira Leite (head), Mr. Begashaw (Resident Representative), Mr. Pellechio, Ms. Zanforlin, and Mr. Prokopenko (AFR), Ms. Khemani and Mr. Kalonji (PDR), and Mr. Kar m). Ms. Castro, Ms. Lampart, and Ms. Le Manchec (World Bank) participated in some mission meetings. Mr. Saint-Ange (IFAD) joined the mission to help assess rural financing issues. l Macroeconomic performance in the first half of 1999 was broadly in line with the program, although waivers will be required. An external shock and, in the third quarter, policy slippages threatened to derail the program. However, the authorities renewed their commitment to the program and agreed to undertake remedial measures, including prior actions. Measures for 1999 are already in place; those for 2000 have been discussed by the cabinet, but some, including the 2000 budget, will require parliamentary action.

Macroeconomic performance in the first half of 1999 was broadly in line with the program. Because of a shortfall in nontax revenue, two performance criteria, domestic primary surplus and net domestic financing of government, as well aa the benchmark for domestic revenue, were missed. After the adjuster for foreign program assistance shortfall was applied, deviations were not large. A June structural performance criterion on the offer for sale of the Produce Buying Company was only observed in October. Temporary external arrears were accumulated at the end of June but were eliminated in October. The government implemented new measures to keep the program on course, including prior actions for completing the first review under the three- year ESAP arrangement. Main issues l Fiscal sustainability. A medium-term fiscal sustainability analysis provided the basis for discussion of measures needed to address the external shock. The staff urged the government to undertake swift adjustment in 1999 as a precautionary measure against deeper deterioration in the balance of payments and fiscal accounts expected in 2000. Remedial measures decided by the cabinet, some of which still require parliamentary approval, include a sharp cut in domestic capital expenditures in 1999; an increase in the VAT rate; enhancement of nontax revenue; and increases in petroleum taxes. l Exchange rate. Despite a sharp terms of trade shock, the real effective exchange rate of the cedi continued to appreciate, owing to Bank of Ghana intervention, particularly in the third quarter. Bank of Ghana foreign exchange operations are now focused on achieving its net foreign assets target, and the cedi is expected to depreciate faster until the market clears. The market exchange rate will be calculated from transaction rates starting in mid-October instead of fiorn indicative quotes from commercial banks; data on the Bank of Ghana’s gross international reserves will be published monthly; and technical assistance will be provided to develop an active interbank market in foreign exchange. l Structural reforms. Divestimre proceeds were negligible in the first half of 1999, pointing to a lack of momentum in the divestiture program, both in terms of completing new divestitures and collecting revenues from previous sales. The government needs to reinvigorate the program and increase its transparency. Cocou producer prices were kept unchanged despite the decline in world prices, raising the producers’ share in f.o.b. export prices substantially above the minimum target under the program. At September exchange rates and world prices, only cocoa of main crop characteristics could be bought profitably at the prevailing producer prices. The staff has proposed a producer price system that takes into account the difference in cocoa bean characteristics and their prices in world markets.

These include: full observance of the quantitative and structural benchmarks set for September 1999, as agreed with the staff; offer for sale of PBC; elimination of external arrears; submission to parliament of an increase in the value added tax; preparation of a report on customs problems and remedial measures; divestiture of the State Transport Company and GHACEM, a cement factory; completion of a review of the tariff regime; appointment of a liquidator for BHC and Coop; adoption of new procedure to calculate market exchange rates; publication of gross international reserves; and provision to the staff of information on the fourth Ghana Living Standards Survey and on the methodology to compile national accounts. 7?re sfa#recommen& that waivers be grantedfor the nonobservance of the June 1999 andseptember 1999 performance criteria, that thefirst review under the three-year ESAF arrangement be completed, and that the authorities’ request for modl@cation of performance criteria for December be granted.

On h4ay 3, 1999, the Executive Board approved the current Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) arrangement, noting improvements in Ghana’s macroeconomic. performance and progress on structural reforms, in particular, the successful implementation of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and introduction of the value-added tax (VAT). Executive Directors strongly urged acceleration of the divestiture program and reforms in the cocoa and energy sectors. Ghana is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. 2. Ghana suffered a major external shock in 1999. World prices for cocoa and gold, Ghana’s main exports, plummeted, and oil prices doubled. These problems were aggravated by a shortfall in foreign assistance. Although the terms of trade impact was cushioned by the use of forward contracts and hedges, its effects began to be felt in the second half of 1999 and will continue in 2000. In the first half of 1999, macroeconomic performance was broadly in line with the program; however, because of weaknesses in nontax revenue, two performance criteria for June, domestic primary surplus and net domestic financing of government, as well as the benchmark on domestic revenue, were missed. 3. A structural performance criterion, the offer for sale of the Produce Buying Company (PBC), was carried out in October only. Ghana accumulated external arrears at the end of June but eliminated them by early October. Also, a structural performance criterion for September, the withdrawal of banking licenses from three banks not complying with the capital adequacy ratio was not carried out as planned. The authorities are liquidating two of the banks, but were advised by consultants to withdraw the banking licenses at a later stage in the liquidation process. The staffs expectation is that the banking licenses will be withdrawn by end-1999. PriceWaterhouseCoopers was chosen in early November as liquidators for these two banks. A group of investors was given a three- month grace period to acquire and recapitalize the third bank. All three banks are under close central bank supervision and are only authorized to place timds on government securities. In view of the measures taken, the staff believes that the main objectives of this performance criterion, the protection of customers deposits and the enforcement of prudential requirements, are being fUlfilled. 4. Program implementation weakened in the third quarter, owing to external factors and policy slippages. The government tightened its policies in late September, putting in place remedial actions for 1999. The government is also asking for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-l- parliamentary approval for measures to strengthen the economy in 2000. These actions and measures are described in the attached letter of intent and accompanying memorandum. In light of these measures, the staff recommends the granting of waivers, completion of the first review under the three-year ESAF arrangement, and granting of the authorities’ request for modification of performance criteria for December 1999. II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE A. Real Growth, Prices, and Exchange Rate 5. Real GDP growth for 1999 is forecast to reach 4.5 percent, 1 percentage point below the original program forecast. Weather patterns have been favorable to agriculture, and above-average rainfall has replenished water levels at the Akosombo dam. Activity in construction and manufacturing remains buoyant. Nevertheless, real GDP growth is expected to slow down in the fourth quarter owing to tighter policies and external factors (Table 1). 6. Inflation continued its downward trend from last year, dropping below 10 percent on an annual basis in May 1999 for the first time since 1992 (Figure 1). Tight monetary policy and sharp declines in food prices were largely responsible for this trend. Since June, upward adjustments of petroleum product prices, transportation services, and water tariffs, as well as the retroactive payment of public sector wages, caused the consumer price index to increase to 12.7 percent in July. The inflation rate resumed its downward trend in August, reaching 11.8 percent in October. Inflation is expected to finish the year at lo-12 percent, somewhat above the original program projection of 9 percent, in part because of an accelerated depreciation of the cedi (see below). 7. The cedi depreciated by 15 percent in the 1Zmonth period ended in September 1999, about three times faster than in the previous year. Even so, this nominal depreciation was not sufficient to prevent a fi,uther real effective appreciation of the cedi, in great part because the Bank of Ghana was selling foreign exchange in excess of program targets. As a result, from June onward, importers began queuing to purchase foreign exchange from commercial banks, while exporters slowed down the repatriation of their foreign exchange earnings. Beginning in September, the central bank has focused primarily on meeting its net foreign assets target, and a faster exchange rate depreciation is expected to ensue until the market clears.

The domestic primary surplus for the first half of 1999, a performance criterion, was below its target by 0.1 percent of GDP, as higher-than-expected ta+ collections did not Mly make up for lower nontax revenue (Figure 2 and Tables 3-5)’ Domestic noninterest spending was about as projected. The overall deficit was 0.3 percent lower than projected, mainly because of delays in external financing of capital expenditure. Shortfalls in domestic revenue and external program assistance, as well as a lack of divestiture receipts, caused net domestic financing to exceed its program ceiling by 1.1 percent of GDP, application of the adjuster for the shortfall in foreign program assistance reduces the excess to 0.2 percent of GDP. 9. The VAT has been in effect from the beginning of the year and is operating well. Domestic collections in the first half of 1999 were below projected levels as taxpayers took advantage of grace periods for filing returns and appealed for exemptions. This shortfall was made up by higher collections on imports, which is the result of the VAT’s single rate, fewer exemptions, and larger number of taxpayers than the previous sales tax. 10. In April 1999, the government adopted a new salary structure. that became effective in June and was applied retroactively to the beginning of the year, resulting in lump-sum payments made mostly in July. An important outcome was the elimination of various allowances for rent, car maintenance, and other items by incorporating them into a higher wage. The resulting average wage increase for 1999 (20 percent) was in line with the program assumptions. 11. Domestic interest payments at midyear were below projection by 0.1 percent of GDP, but are now running higher than expected because of substantially greater net domestic financing. Ghana’s domestic debt burden is heavy in comparison with other countries (Box 1), crowding out priority expenditures and raising concerns regarding the sustainability of this debt. 12. Payments of road-related arrears in the first half were slightly larger than planned, but the interest charge on the outstanding stock at the end of 1998 kept the total amount of arrears from declining. A substantial payment in July covered this charge and reduced the outstanding stock to about half its end-1998 level. ‘The benchmark for domestic revenue was also missed by 0.2 percent of GDP.

Monetary Developments 13. Monetary policy remained on course through midyear as both reserve money and broad money met their targets, increasing by 14.9 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively (Table 6). Net credit to government by the banking system exceeded its program target by 2.3 percent of GDP, mostly because of the shortfall in foreign program assistance, but also because fewer treasury bills were placed with nonbanks. Credit to the private sector also increased rapidly, growing by 34.5 percent for the year ended in June 1999, reflecting B buoyant economy and higher imports. To accommodate the strong credit demand and to comply with the foreign exchange exposure regulations introduced by the central bank in December 1998, commercial banks reduced markedly their net foreign assets position. Net foreign assets of the Bank of Ghana were below their target level at the end of June. However, after the application of program adjusters for the shortfall in foreign assistance, the net foreign asset position was on target. 14. In April 1999, the central bank lowered its rediscount rate from 32 percent to 27 percent. Deposit and lending rates of commercial banks followed trends in the financial markets, declining by about 5 percentage points from the beginning of the year to September. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- However, high public sector borrowing caused the treasury bill rate, which had declined a couple of percentage points to 24 percent at the end of June, to rise to about 27 percent at the end of September. 15. In the third quarter, the Bank of Ghana found it difficult to contain reserve money expansion because of the mounting pressure from high public borrowing. To control reserve money, the Bank of Ghana not only raised the volume of its open market operations but also sold foreign currency, bringing its net foreign assets below program targets. As a result of these policies, the exchange rate did not ri.rlly adjust to the terms of trade shock, gross international reserves reached US8303 million (compared with US8508 million in December 1998), or the equivalent of I .2 months of imports, and, ultimately, the reserve money target for September still had to be loosened. D. External Developments 16. The significant declines in world prices for Ghana’s main exports, cocoa and gold, and the increase in the world price of oil are adversely affecting Ghana’s external current account. World gold prices fell by about 10 percent in the 12-month period ended August 1999. The impact of a 22 percent decline in cocoa price was only partially offset by a larger export volume. As a result, the current account deficit is projected to be 4% percent of GDP in 1999, about 1% percentage points higher than originally projected (Figure 3 and Tables 7-8). 17. There was a US%169 million shortfall in foreign assistance in the first half of 1999. Program grants fell short of projections by US%18 million. Japan suspended the disbursement of a US%50 million program loan while reassessing its exposure in light of the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Project grants and loans in the first half fell short of their projected amounts by US$56 million and US%45 million, respectively. E. Structural Reforms 18. Except for the divestiture program, structural reforms have progressed broadly in line with the program. In the financial sector, the Bank of Ghana began procedures to withdraw licenses from banks not meeting capital adequacy requirements. Two small state-owned banks, BHC and Coop, are now under liquidation. A third bank was given a three-month grace period while a group of investors attempt to recapitalize it. Management changes have contributed to strengthen the GCB, the largest state-owned bank, and the National Investment Bank (NIB). The NIB board is expected to hire soon a new general manager from a list of professional bankers compiled by the Bank of Ghana. It has been asked to adhere to a conservative business plan to improve its prospects for divestiture. The minimum capita1 of rural banks was increased from C 50 million to C 100 million in October 1999. 19. In April 1999, the cabinet approved, after extensive consultation with stakeholders, a medium-term cocoa strategy designed to improve incentives for producers, promote competition in the domestic market, and end the public monopoly in cocoa exports.

In June, the producer price of cocoa for the 199912000 crop season was announced at the same level as in the 1998/99 season. Given the sharp decline in world cocoa prices, this decision is expected to raise the producers’ share in the f.o.b. export price to 74 percent, substantially above the 60 percent minimum target under the program, and cause a marked reduction in cocoa tax revenue for 2000. At September exchange rates and prices, the producer price of cocoa in Ghana is about 16 percent above that in C&e d’Ivoire and has encouraged some cross-border smuggling into Ghana, a reversal of the situation normally experienced in the past.* The Produce Buying Company was finally offered for sale in October, and its shares are expected to be floated in the stock exchange before the year’s end. 20. Also in April 1999, the Divestiture Implementation Committee (DIG) published a divestiture work plan, including economically significant enterprises and setting annual targets for divestiture receipts for the period 1999-2001. Since then, however, divestiture receipts have collapsed. This trend was reversed only in October when the divestitures of two large enterprises, the State Transport Company and GHACEM, a cement factory, were completed.3 The government implemented a financial restructuring plan for the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) and expects to offer it for sale by the end of the year.4 21. In addition to the implementation of a new public service wage structure, progress in other areas of Ghana’s public sector reform program continues. In June 1999, the cabinet approved the legal framework for reform of subvented agencies and established two committees for addressing employment opportunities for retrenched staff and the reform of central management agencies. The cabinet chose 33 subvented agencies for the pilot reform project, with the World Bank fimding a substantial share of the cost. The target date for completion of the project is end-2001. The Committee on Strategic Coordination was established as a permanent agency with responsibility for reforming and regulating central management agencies and establishing accountability. III. MEDIUM-TERM ADJUSTMENT STRATEGY 22. The main objective of Ghana’s medium-term development strategy is to raise the living standards in Ghana to those of a middle-income country by 2020. The external shock faced in 1999 highlights the need to consolidate macroeconomic stability, while forging ahead with structural reforms aimed at making the economy more efficient and diversified. ‘See Chapter V in “Ghana-Selected Issues” (SM/98/255; 1 l/18/98). ’ Divestiture receipts from these sales amount to US%3 1.5 million. 4See also Chapter VI in “Ghana-Selected Issues” (SM/99/269; Sup. 1, 1 l/5/99).

Box 2 highlights the changes in the medium-term framework resulting from the external shock. Real GDP growth is expected to slow down in 2000, as imports will be constrained by a more depreciated exchange rate and tighter demand management policies; meanwhile, the growth of nontraditional exports may take longer to rebound (Figure 3). However, real GDP growth may still reach 4 percent in 2000 if exceptional external financing is forthcoming (see paragraph 3 1). From 2001 onward, growth is expected to accelerate, returning to the original path in 2003 (Table 11). 24. Gross investment is projected to increase slightly over the medium term from 24% percent of GDP in 1998 to 26% percent of GDP in 2007. However, public investment is expected to show a decline of 3 percentage points of GDP over the period, while private investment will increase by 4% percentage points of GDP. This trend reflects government’s efforts to disengage from activities more appropriately pursued by the private sector, not only through divestiture, but also by mobilizing private investment in infrastructure and utilities. 2s. Gross national savings are also expected to increase steadily over the next decade, rising to 23% percent of GDP in 2007 from 19% percent in 1998. Most of this increase would be due to a gradual increase in public savings, to be achieved through efforts to prevent government revenues from declining while reducing expenditures as a share of GDP. Nevertheless, expenditures on health, education, and other poverty-reducing initiatives will be protected. Private savings are also expected to increase somewhat, helped by a gradual increase of income per capita and the financial sector reforms. 26. A medium-term fiscal sustainability analysis provided the basis for discussion of the measures needed to address the external shock and bring the economy back on the original medium-term course (Box 3).’ The analysis suggests that it would be prudent for Ghana to maintain revenue as a share of GDP over the medium term, while reducing cocoa taxes and tariffs to improve equity and efficiency. More broadly, it points to the need for fiscal adjustment to set the stage for a gradual reduction of the ratio of domestic debt to GDP and to ensure that high interest rates and interest payments do not crowd out priority government expenditures and discourage private investment. 27. Monetary policy will be consistent with an inflation rate of not more than 5 percent from end-2001 onward. Broad money is expected to grow slightly faster than nominal GDP. To achieve this objective, net domestic financing of government will need to fall from 4 percent of GDP in 1999 to -1 percent in 2007, so as to avoid crowding out the private ‘For additional details and scenarios, see Chapter III in “Ghana-Selected Issues” (?&t/99/269, Sup. 1; 1 l/5/99).

The external debt-service ratio was projected to decline from 22 percent in 1998 to below 10 Percent in 2003 as Ghana continues to make large amortisation payments and observe the moratorium on nonconcessional external borrowing (Table 10). ’ Ghana obtained a nonconcessional rescheduling of certain arrears in 1996. ‘See for details of the debt sustainability analysis.

Assuming a decision point in September 2000 and with debt relief based on estimated end-of-1999 data, Ghana could qualify for support under the HlPC Initiative, as its net present value of debt-to-exports ratio for 1999, at 172 percent exceeds the 150 percent threshold under the enhanced HIPC framework. However, it appears that Ghana would qualify for deeper relief under the openness/fiscal criterion as its b&V of debt-to-revenue ratio at 292 percent, significantly exceeds the 250 percent threshold. In the latter case, the debt relief would amount to about US%O.6 billion in net present value terms. 30. The DSA analysis also shows that most of Ghana’s problems are bunched in the immediate three years, when Ghana has to make payments on earlier nonconcessional borrowing. The authorities indicated that they would have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of participating in the HJPC Initiativ+specitically, the potential savings in debt service against the possible loss in donor assistance and access to world financial markets. They mentioned that they were leaning toward trying to obtain relief from donors on a bilateral basis, outside the HIPC Initiative. Such an approach could, for example, take the form of higher and sustainable levels of new assistance, preferably on a grant basis. 31. The balance of payments will be under pressure in 2000. Ghana has already sold its 1999/2000 main cocoa crop forward; therefore, even if prices improve in 2000, the effect on cocoa export proceeds will be small. Gold prices strengthened considerably in early October as European central banks announced that they would be limiting the amount of gold sales in the next five years. However, Ashanti Goldfields Co. (AGC), the largest Ghanaian gold producer, expected gold prices to decline and hedged according1y.s The company has been reported to have covered itself for future declines of gold prices by buying put options on gold, and raising financing for these operations by selling call options. This strategy has exposed the company to a considerable financial loss on its hedging portfolio once gold prices began to rise. If buyers of call options sold by AGC choose to exercise their right to delivery, AGC is likely to be faced with large obligations in the short term. AGC stock has plunged after this news broke out. AGC is said to be in merger talks with foreign companies. The board of the company is discussing the best strategy to raise the necessary funds and some buyback operations of the hedge portfolio were reported to have taken place. It is not expected that the resolution of AGC problems will involve government resources. It is clear, however, that any improvement in the balance of payments on account of an increase in gold prices may be counterbalanced by losses on hedges. 32. Considering the need to cushion the impact of the terms of trade shock so as to protect priority expenditures, external financing requirements are estimated to amount to * Ashanti Goldmines Co is the largest company in Ghana, responsible for 35 percent of Ghana’s gold exports.

The authorities are hopeful that the observed shortfall in foreign assistance in the first half of 1999 will be reversed in the second half The government estimates a financing need of US$769 million in 2000, excluding US.8230 million expected to come from the World Bank and Fund drawings under the current program. About US%250 million of the financing is expected in program grants and loans. ln light of its large additional financing requirements, the government has requested higher access under the present ESAF arrangement. The staff agreed to consider it in the context of the next review. 33. Over the medium term, Ghana’s external position is forecast to improve as exports receipts are expected to grow by close to 11 percent annually; meanwhile, imports should decline slightly as a share of GDP as the economy diversifies. The current account deficit, including official transfers, is expected to decline from 6 percent of GDP in 2000 to 3 percent of GDP in 2007. IV. POLICY DBCUSSIONS 34. The policy discussions centered around the authorities’ proposed response to the current external shock and their remedial measures to correct policy slippages in the third quarter of 1999. In response to the discussions, the cabinet met and approved in principle a package of measures, including a sharp cut in domestic capital expenditures in 1999 and an increase in the VAT rate. These actions, as well as steps to ensure that the structural reforms continue to move ahead, are the main elements of a revised program for 1999 and for the 2000 budget that-the authorities and the staff believe-would justify completion of the first ESAF review. A. Fiscal Policies 35. In view of the external shock, the staffurged the government to undertake swift adjustment in 1999, as a precautionary measure against deeper deterioration in the balance of payments and fiscal accounts expected in 2000. Although the external shock was outside the authorities’ control, the staff felt that the government could have taken remedial steps early in the third quarter to contain the impact of the external shock. Among the policies that contributed to a deterioration of the program performance in the third quarter, the staff mentioned the retroactive payment of salary increases in July, the acceleration of domestic capital spending in the third quarter, and the announcement of a cocoa price for the 1999/2000 season that reduces cocoa tax revenue in 1999 and, at present exchange rates, virtually eliminates it in 2000. Poor customs administration as evidenced by low effective duty rates was also mentioned, particularly given press reports of significant leakage of duty Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2o- collections through bonded warehouses.g The staff also inquired into the reasons for the shortfall in nontax revenue. 36. The authorities explained that the government considered parceling the retroactive payment over the remainder of the year, but the unions objected strenuously to it, and the government finally concluded that it would be unfair to tinther delay payment as the unions had negotiated in good faith. The acceleration of capital expenditures was attributed to lags between signing contracts and executing expenditures. When the authorities began curtailing spending there was already a pipeline of expenditures that could no longer be cut. Regarding the cocoa producer price, the authorities argued that raising the producers’ share in the fo.b. price to 65-75 percent was not unreasonable f%om the equity perspective, and would protect the rural poor from the effects of the external shock. They explained the shortfall in nontax revenue primarily as the result of low central bank profits in 1998, an outcome that could not be changed in 1999, although they agreed that it should have been predicted when preparing the 1999 budget. 37. The authorities agreed with the staff that remedial measures should be promptly implemented to prevent a major disruption in the economy in 2000. They suggested that a sharp adjustment in the fourth quarter of 1999 could be achieved by limiting domestic capital expenditures to 0.4 percent of GDP in that period (thus reducing them for the year by 0.7 percentage point compared with the program). The staffwas concerned about the impact of the cut in domestic capital expenditure on complementary foreign-financed capital expenditure. While sharing the staffs concern the authorities emphasized that the bulk of the discretionary expenditures were in domestic capital expenditures; it was therefore inevitable that it would suffer the brunt of the adjustment. While tax measures were clearly needed, they will require parliamentary approval and could yield results only in 2000. In the meantime, the authorities proposed to encourage efforts by the VAT Service to enhance compliance through higher penalties, automatic assessments of liabilities for nontilers, and prosecution of nonpayers. They also agreed that a more aggressive enforcement of customs procedures, particularly the close monitoring of bonded warehouses, was urgently needed, and they indicated that they had requested customs to take immediate remedial actions, including punitive measures, if warranted. A summary of the fiscal measures for 1999 and 2000 is presented in Box 4. ‘A serious breakdown of controls on bonded warehouse was reported by the press during the mission and is said to have caused significant losses to customs revenue. Offtcials alleged to be involved have been suspended pending completion of the investigations. About C 28.8 billion in revenue losses have been traced to identified individuals or firms, and C 6 billion has been recouped so far. The judicial process is still to start.

The authorities are assessing the alternatives, including related legal issues, with a view to incorporating proposals in the 2000 budget. In the case of tariff exemptions, the work is more advanced, allowing the staff to make a first estimate. 38. Accepting the urgent need to raise revenue, the authorities sought and received cabinet approval in principle for a VAT rate increase to about 12.5 percent. They agreed to submit the necessary legislation to parliament when it convened in October/November so that the higher rate would become effective at the beginning of next year. The government also indicated its intention to raise petroleum taxation and to expand the VAT base by reducing the scope of exemptions. The government is also considering limiting capital allowances under the income tax. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - 39. Ghana’s trade restrictiveness index remains unchanged at 5. In the context of the Trade and Investment Reform Program financed by USAD, the government is conducting a review of the tariff system aimed at ensuring that Ghana remains efficient and competitive as a producer and exporter. This review also addressed deficiencies in customs administration. Present reform plans include a gradual reduction of average tariff rate over the medium term, together with elimination of tariff exemptions and improvements in customs procedures. The government is now studying the consultants’ report, which was completed in late October. The next step will be for the government to define a precise implementation strategy and timetable, including measures to strengthen customs administration. The authorities reiterated their commitment to reducing the maximum tariff rate in the 2000 6om 25 percent to 20 percent budget in line with regional trends. 40. In the context of its medium-term fiscal sustainability analysis, the authorities and stat-Y discussed the establishment of a domestic debt-reduction fund financed by donors, but recognised that caution was needed to ensure that additional priority expenditures made possible by savings in debt service would not be so high as to endanger liquidity control or exceed absorptive capacity. A debt-reduction timd could be part of the macroeconomic strategy for 2000, provided donor support is sufftcient and financing is truly additional to the amounts assumed in the basic program. lo B. Exchange Bates and the Terms of Trade Shock 41. The statT expressed concern that the real effective exchange rate of the cedi was still appreciating (Box 5, and Figures 1 and 5). The concern was grounded in the belief that the exchange rate had a role to play in absorbing some of the impact of the external shock, as well as in the staffs perception that the growth of nontraditional exports, which had been one of the bright spots in Ghana’s economic performance, could slow down if the appreciation were not reversed soon.” “See also Box 3 and Chapter Ill of “Ghana-Selected Issues” (&l/99/269, Sup. 1; 1 l/5/99). “For an analysis of the performance of nontraditional exports, see Chapter II of “Ghana-Selected Issues” (W/99/269, Sup. 1; 1 l/5/99).

Ghana: Competitiveness Altbougb there are tnsny ways to assess competitiveness, and they do not always point in the same direction, the brunt of the evidence increasingly shows that the cedi is becoming overvalued. The real effective exchange rate, calcolated on the basis of the consomer price indices of Ghana and its trading partners, has been genemlly appreciating since 1995 (Figore 5). The same behavior is observed if the real effective exchange rates are calculated using GDP deflators and export prices. Also, although wage costs have been generally contained in Ghana in recent years, unit labor costs are still increasing vis-his those in psrtoer coonhies. The iotemal real exchaoge rate, defined as the ratio of the prices of nontradable to tit of tradable goods, has also tended to generally appreciate over the 1995-99 period. In contrast with export prices, which have broadly followed trends in labor costs sod in domestic prices, import prices have retied relatively stable with respect to those of Ghana’s partners; this suggests that the country has not been experiencing a relative increase in production costs, owing to the use of imported inputs. Nevertheless, taken together, these indicators show a gtadoal loss of competitiveness in international markets. While it is hue that this appreciation could be explained in part by the positive movement of the terms of trade in recent years, their sharp deterioration in 1999 has not resulted in a correction in the appreciating trends of the real effective exchange rate indicators as one would expect. An interesting competitiveness compsrison is with C&e d’Ivoire, a neighboring coo&y deriving as does Ghana a significant potion of its export receipts from cocoa. The bottom right panel of Figure 5 provides a dire& comparjson of the CPLbssed real effective exchange rates in C&e d’Ivoire and Ghana Except for the 1994 devslmtioa of the CFA franc, the real effective exchange rate shows sigoificsntly greater stability in C&e d’lvoire than in Ghana, as the formefs inflation rate has been much more stable (and lower). This factor, per se, raises the competitiven~ of C&e d’Ivoire tis&vis Ghana Moreover, if one assumes that in 1995, one year after the CFA franc devaloation, the exchange rates in Ghaoa and C&e d’Ivoire were in equilibrium, one would conclude that, while from 1992 to 1995, Ghana had a competitive advantage vis-&vis C&e d’Ivoire. such an advantage is being lost situ 1996. Fioally, exporters have become increasingly vocal in affirming that the exchange rate is overvalued, and that real lending rates in the country are much higher lhan those in competing West African wunhies. The concern is that the strong growth in nontraditional exports in Ghana, which has been an importaat growth factor ia recent years, could be negatively affected in the near fotore. 42. The central bank rate in Ghana is calculated from indicative exchange rates quoted by commercial banks.” The staff noted that in the third quarter of 1999 the Bank of Ghana had intervened in the market by selling foreign exchange in excess of the program target. The central bank authorities explained their larger-than-programmed intervention in the foreign market as part of an effort to keep reserve money under control when faced with increased ‘r Although the central bank rate is described as an average interbank rate, the interbank market is not active, with most of the transactions taking place between banks and the Bank of Ghana.

The staffurged the authorities to stop their intervention, as international reserves levels had already been considerably depleted, and to ensure that the exchange rate was allowed to move freely to clear the market. It argued that intervention in foreign exchange markets other than those directed to meeting the net foreign assets target and prevent marked short-term fluctuations in exchange rates were not consistent with the objectives of the program, 43. While the central bank authorities told the mission that the Bank of Ghana was no longer selling in the foreign exchange market, they expressed concern that a faster depreciation would impact on domestic prices and rekindle inflationary expectations. The staff suggested that, while a short-term impact of the depreciation on prices was inevitable, this impact would gradually disappear if policies were to remain tight. Monetary policy in particular should ensure that reserve money is kept under control even at the cost of having to raise interest rates. 44. The staff attributed the lack of a more vigorous market response in September to the absence of true interbank rates that could be used as representative rates. Market adjustment seemed slow because the central bank was using indicative exchange rate quotes by commercial banks as the basis to calculate the market rate (as opposed to transaction rates). The staff argued that the transaction rates used by banks were increasingly more depreciated than their indicative quotes. In the absence of interbank rates, the staff and the authorities agreed to calculate the central bank rate on the basis of average rates reported by banks on transactions with customers. Application ofthis new procedure began in mid-October. To increase the transparency of their operations in the foreign exchange market, the authorities agreed to publish the gross international reserves monthly, 45. The mission discussed with the authorities the recent MAE technical assistance mission on the operation of the foreign exchange markets, which concluded that requiring foreign exchange dealers to always provide firm two-way quotes would be an important step in ensuring that they begin to transact among themselves, instead of with the central bank. In the medium term, the authorities and the staff agreed that the development of an active interbank market in foreign exchange was crucial. The authorities requested urgent technical assistance to help the central bank undertake this task. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-26- 46. Exporters of cocoa and gold must surrender their foreign exchange receipts to the Bank of Ghana. The surrender requirement on cocoa beans follows from their export still being a state monopoly. The government has, however, agreed to review the requirement in the 2000/01 crop year, when licensed buying agents will be allowed to export directly for the first time. The mission broached the subject of gradually reducing and eliminating the surrender requirements on gold.13 The authorities responded that they would prefer to wait until the balance of payments was stronger. The staff suggested that a review of surrender requirements should go hand in hand with the authorities’ efforts to foster an active interbank market in foreign exchange. 47. The staff emphasized the need to ensure that the 1999 target for accumulation of the net foreign assets of the central bank (US$SO million) was achieved. This would imply an US%27 million reduction in the original target, which equals the net shortfall in external program assistance projected for the year. The Bank of Ghana expressed concern that, given its present position, this target would require excessive purchases of foreign exchange in the market at a very delicate moment. However, the staff observed that cocoa receipts tended to be strong in the fourth quarter, facilitating the achievement of the proposed net foreign assets target. C. Monetary Policy Implementation and Financial Sector Issues 48. The staff questioned the choice of foreign exchange sales to control reserve money expansion, particularly in the third quarter. It felt that a more extensive use of open market operations would have contributed to a smoother adjustment of the exchange rate to the terms of trade shock. It also pointed out that by raising interest rates early on the central bank would have made a more forceitl statement to the government and the public that there was a need to take remedial measures to cope with the external shocks and policy slippages. The staff also argued that partly because the interest rates failed to increase and partly because of expectations of a faster depreciation, the Bank of Ghana had serious difftculties in placing treasury bills with nonbanks. The monetary authorities reiterated their concern that real interest rates were already very high and tinther increases could choke off economic activity. They agreed, however, that with hindsight, reserve money should have been controlled primarily by open market operations, leaving the exchange rate to adjust to market pressures, which is the approach they would be taking in the remainder of the year. 13The surrender requirements on gold are based on company by company contracts and vary between 20 and 40 percent.

The staff and authorities discussed what would be an appropriate monetary policy stance in the fourth quarter, agreeing on constraining reserve money growth to 12% percent to ensure that inflation remained as close as possible to 10 percent. This stance implies a stepping up of open market operations and a likely upward pressure on interest rates. The staffreviewed with Bank of Ghana offtcials activity in the treasury bill market, especially the use of repurchase agreements, and agreed that the experience had been positive. However, the cash-flow projections by government were still inadequate, making liquidity management a challenge. The government indicated that it would welcome firther technical assistance on this issue. On a related matter, staff also noted that Ghana’s external financing support is very large relative to its main monetary aggregates and that the recent volatility of such financing has been causing problems for Ghana’s monetary program under the current ESAP. Staff will, therefore, return to this issue at the time of the next review and will discuss with the authorities and donors various ways in which the program could best address this problem. 50. The authorities indicated that, except for three small banks (BCC, BHC and Coop), the Ghanaian banking system is sound. The average capital adequacy ratio for the banking industry is 13 percent and the share of nonperforming loans in the system has been falling steadily reaching 10 percent at end of June 1999, a 4 percentage points Improvement over June 1998. NIB, a state-owned bank with some problems, has been implementing management changes and other measures agreed with the Bank of Ghana to make it a more attractive divestiture prospect, but the bank meets key prudential requirements. The authorities reiterated their intention to vigorously enforce prudential rules and impose penalties whenever appropriate to ensure the soundness of the banking system. The staff urged the authorities to move ahead with their plans for divesting the remaining central bank and government shares in commercial banks. New central bank and banking laws will be submitted to parliament by the end of the year. 51. The government has decided to close BHC and Coop, and to give BCC a three-month grace period to either meet the capital adequacy requirement or start liquidation procedures. PriceWaterhouseCoopers was chosen in early November as liquidators for the fust two banks. The authorities are confident that the closure of the BHC and Coop, and if necessary, BCC, can be handled without loss of confidence in the banking system. Together, these three banks account for only 3.2 percent of deposits and the government has indicated that it is ready to issue government securities to back deposits transferred to other banks. All three banks are only authorised to place fimds in government securities. As part of the liquidation process, the government will determine in consultation with its lawyers and consultants, the most advisable time for the licenses of these banks to be revoked, which is a condition for the World Bank’s Economic Reform Support Operation to be disbursed. The staff expectation is that the licenses will be withdrawn before end-1999. At September exchange rates, the cost to the government of liquidating the three banks was estimated at USS35 million, which is less than the original estimate (US850 million). The staff will review the status of the liquidation process as part of the second ESAP review. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - 52. The struTdiscussed rural financing and supervision, including rural banking, agricultural credit-both formal and informal-and microcredit programs, in collaboration with the staff of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IPAD) and the World Bank. I4 The Bank of Ghana explained its efforts to improve the soundness of rural banks, including the progress made in setting up an apex institution to support them. The staff also attended a seminar on the use of informal institutions as a bridge between the rural poor and the rural banks, particularly in smaller communities. D. Other Structural Reforms 53. The staff observed that the process of bringing public enterprises for sale seemed excessively cumbersome and slow. The authorities pointed to transparency concerns, the need to ensure a fair valuation of each enterprise, and problems in selecting sales advisors in accordance with internationally acceptable procurement rules. The authorities explained that the sale of the Ghana Oil Company (GOIL) was close to completion, but that the President’s O&e had asked DIC to make sure that proper transparency procedures had been followed . before clearing the sale. The sale, expected by the end of the year, would yield about US%15 million in 2000. Divestiture proceeds are estimated at US$37.6 million in 1999 and US$42.6 million in 2000, which are in line with the program. 54. The mission discussed the effects of keeping the cocoa price paid to producers unchanged from the 1998/99 season to the 1999/2000 season, even though world prices dropped sharply. The staff pointed out that high producer prices implied losses on the export of lower-quality beans and encouraged smuggling of such beans from C&e d’Ivoire to Ghana. While the authorities agreed with the staffs suggestion to reduce the price paid for lower quality beans, they believed that the introduction of the two-tier pricing was not urgent as Ghana was at the beginning of the main crop season, when most of the beans were of the best quality. Therefore, they would like to consult with stakeholders on how to best implement the two-tier pricing strategy and adopt the measure in mid-2000, after assuring themselves that possible technical problems could be solved satisfactorily. 55. One of the elements of the Ghana Vision 2020 development strategy is the emphasis on decentralization as a mechanism to bring the decision-making process close to the people, so as to improve the targeting of expenditures and enhance accountability. I5 A Fiscal Decentralization Subcommittee of the PUPMARP Steering Committee was set up in April 14For additional details, see Chapter Vll of “Ghana-Selected Issues,” (SM/99/269, Sup. 1; 1 l/5/99). “Government of Ghana, “Ghana-Vision 2020 (The First Step: 1996-2000),” January 6, 1995. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - 1999.16 This subcommittee will oversee the fiscal decentralization project undertaken by the government, with assistance from the Canadian International Development Agency. The authorities explained that a key goal of the project was to ensure that decentralization went hand in hand with fiscal discipline and accountability. An objective was to develop composite district budgets, fully compatible with the medium-term expenditure framework, which were expected to contain all development programs taking place in a district, irrespective of their sources of financing. A local government act is expected to be submitted to parliament in 1999, creating a local civil service and the administrative and accounting framework for the districts. 56. A strategy for poverty reduction was adopted as part of the government’s first medium-term development plan in mid-1997. The overarching goal of the strategy is for Ghana to attain the standard of living of a middle-income country by 2020.r7 The underlying strategy for poverty reduction emphasizes economic growth, rural development, expansion of employment opportunities for the urban poor, and improved access of the rural and urban poor to basic public services, such as housing, transportation, water supply and sewerage, and family planning services. Investment in human capital, aimed at developing a more educated, better trained, and healthier population; is also part of the poverty reduction and growth strategy Since 1995, spending on health and education has increased as a proportion of both total domestic primary expenditure and GDP (Table 3). 57. A new poverty reduction strategy document is being prepared by the government and will be presented to the Consultative Group meeting, scheduled to take place in Accra in November 1999. The document will take stock of the various poverty studies carried out in Ghana and set priorities for the future (see also Box 6).t* The government intends to use it as an integral element of its economic program for the 2000-02 period. 16PUFMARP is the Public Financial Management Reform Program set up in 1995 to improve, inter alia, the procedures for budgetary planning, implementation, and monitoring in Ghana. PUFMARP is supported by the World Bank and other donors. ” See Chapter WI of “Ghana: Selected Issues” (SM/99/269, Sup. 1; 1 l/5/99). “For example, Ghana Statistical Service, l’he Putrern ofPoverty in Ghunu, 1988-1992, November 1995; and Ghana Statistical Service, Core Welfare hdicator3 Questionnaire (CWIQJ Survey 1997, March 1998.

Ghana: Poverty Measurement and Profile The main source of detailed information on the social and economic conditions of Ghana’s popolation, inclnding detailed messores of poverty, is the Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS), a moltitopic household sumy undertaken by the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS). Four staveys, denoted GLSSI through GLSM, have been conducted in 1987/88,1988/89,1991/92, and 1998/99, each covering a nationally representative sample of households interviewed over a 12-month period. GLSSl through GLSS3 were used for a consistent analysis of poverty in Ghana over the period of the sorveys. GLSS4 was completed in June 1999 and will serve as the basis for preparing a new poverty-reduction strategy. In 19%, the GSS adopted a new imxnnnent, the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWlQ), for monitoring living standrods more quickly than with the GLSS. The CWlQ is a nationwide probability sample snwey designed to provide measorable indicators for monitoring poverty on a timely basis; it should also help assess the effects of development programs and projects on living standards. Rather than ondettske the time- consnming and computationslly demanding task of measuring expenditore and income, the CWlQ employs a set of readily observable indicators to constmct poverty qnintiles that are closely correlated with the expenditore qointiles based on the GLSS. The tirst CWlQ snrvey was conducted in 1997 from September to November. A comparative analysis of the first three GLSS surveys shows that the overall incidence of poverty in the country declined fmm 37 percent to 3 1 percent over the perid Most of the improvement came from economic growth and the resulting increase in incomes and expenditoms. htcome distribolion mmained stable over the paid, aud growth benetited most regions, espdally rural areas. The rednction in nnal poverty appears to be related to increased reliance on nonfarm self-employment income. Urban areas, other than Accra, benefited from emnomic goti. AItbongh the incident of poverty is lowest in Accra, it increased markedly from 9 percent in 1988 to 23 percent in 1992, largely the result of mral-to-n&an migration. The most important source of income for households in Ghana is selfimployment, acconnting for at least 70 percent of total income. The CWiQ stwey showed 72 percent of honsehold heads to be self-employed in 1997. In the lower qnintiles, most of self-employment income is generated from agricohmal activities, whereas in the high qnintiles it is generated mom from non-t&m self-employment. Households headed by women acconnted for about onethird of households, although the level had been rising slowly. The CWlQ sorvey showed 35 percent of households headed by women in 1997. with significant proportions of these households in the lowest qointile in both nnal(S3.3 percent) and nrban (60.5 percent) areas. E. Exchange Restrictions 58. Ghana has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. It maintains a system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers on current international transactions. V. GOVERNANCE, TRANSPARENCY, AND RISKS 59. Ghana has set up a National Governance Program, which is being implemented by an independent steering committee that comprises representatives of parliament, civil Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- organizations; and development partners.rg This committee reports to the National Oversight Committee, which is chaired by the Vice-President. In mid-1998, the government commissioned an Accountability and Transparency Survey, which revealed low levels of governmental accountability and transparency vis-a-vis civil society and little awareness among the population of the existence of mechanisms to monitor and resolve governance issues. In June 1999, Ghana carried out the third National Governance Workshop organized by the Parliament of Ghana and supported by the UNDP. 60. While praising the government for its efforts to set up mechanisms to enhance governance, the staff indicated its concern about the large number of governance problems that had surfaced in recent years and the slow progress in stamping out corrupt practices. The authorities agreed that more work must be done to ensure accountability and indicated that they would continue to work in the context of the National Governance Program to change practices and perceptions in this area. 61. Ghana has been increasingly using a participatory approach to decision making on core policy issues including agriculture, health, and poverty. This was perhaps best illustrated in the September 1997 National Economic Forum, which gave rise to the Ghana Vision 2020 strategy, and, more recently, in the formulation of the medium-term cocoa strategy. While a participatory approach can enhance ownership, it is time-consuming and can delay urgently needed policy decisions. Strong criticism has been leveled recently at the government for failing to obtain parliamentary approval before committing itself to conditionality in connection with ESAF-supported programs or World Bank program loans. The authorities agreed with the staff that to deflect this criticism the government would need to expand the consultation process to ensure that parliament and, more generally, civil society were kept informed on problems and proposed solutions, so that they could express their views in a timely manner. 62. The staff emphasized that a crucial aspect of an informed public debate on economic issues was the provision of transparent information and data. The staff felt that the quality and timeliness of the country statistics had been declining in recent years. The authorities reassured the staffthat they placed great importance on improving statistics in Ghana. Adequate budget allocations would be made to resolve the issue, and the Ghana Statistical Service was asked to step up efforts to clear its backlog of overdue publications. 63. In 1992 and 1996, election-year pressures resulted in expansionary financial policies that derailed the adjustment effort. The government is fully aware of such risks in the coming year and has expressed a strong commitment to prevent policy slippages. However, the staff believes that the risk of expansionary policies in an election year cannot be totally dismissed. I9 A Serious Fraud Offtce (SFO) was also set up in 1993 as a specialized agency to monitor, investigate and, on the authority of the Attorney-General, prosecute any offense involving serious financial or economic loss to the state. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-32- A foreign financing shortfall or a more protracted external shock could also make it difficult for the government to muster support for additional measures in midyear. To mitigate this risk, the authorities have agreed to define contingency measures in the budget, and to automatically implement them in case of unforeseen shocks. 64. The authorities requested technical assistance for capacity building in several areas, including balance of payments statistics, development of an interbank market in foreign exchange, budget preparation, cash-flow projections, and expenditure control and monitoring. An STA technical assistance mission on money and banking statistics is due to visit Ghana in the first quarter of 2000 and a mission on national accounts in FY2000. 65. Regarding the possibility of economic disruption as a result of Y2K problems, the authorities explained that the Y2K 0fIic.e had been set up more than a year ago and its efforts were paying off. A recent survey shows that most critical companies-which include the Electricity Company of Ghana, Tema Oil Refinery, Ghana Airways, Volta River Authority, Ghana Ports and Harbors Authority, Ghana Water Company, Ghana Broadcasting Corporation, all financial institutions, and Ghana Telecom-are well advanced in their plans to become Y2K compliant, and are now focusing on developing contingency plans in case of unexpected Y2K problems. VL STATISTICALISSUES 66. Slow progress in improving the quality and timeliness of Ghana statistics is a serious concern. In recent years, trade statistics compiled manually by the Customs, Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) and used by the Bank of Ghana to prepare the balance of payments, showed imports significantly lower than those obtained from the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) and partner countries. After reviewing the available data, the government concluded that this data set was incomplete and agreed with the staff that Ghana’s balance of payments should be revised. While awaiting technical assistance from STA for a more in- depth review, the staff has estimated new balance of payments data for 1996-98. Imports and exports are now significantly higher than previously reported by the staff. As a result, (a) international reserves in terms of months of imports are much lower than assumed under the original program, making it more urgent that the Bank of Ghana raise them to comfortable levels; (b) the effective tariff became very low, highlighting the urgent need to improve customs performance; and (c) the debt sustainability analysis for Ghana now shows a significantly stronger position than noted in EBS/99/57. 67. The staff has been aware of problems with trade statistics since 1998 and has had good cooperation from the authorities in resolving this issue. The Executive Board was informed of this problem when approving the latest three-year ESAF arrangement. The staff has no reason to believe that this revision of trade statistics had any material bearing on the observance of performance criteria under the previous Fund-supported programs. Although statistical problems have complicated the staff? analysis of certain aspects of Ghana’s economy, it is unlikely that the policy advice would have been substantially different had the revised trade statistics been put in place sooner. The balance of payments revision also Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 33 - caused the national accounts to be reestimated by the staff.” The staff is reviewing the national accounts methodology used by the GSS and will propose improvements before the next review, scheduled for April 2000. 68. As envisaged under the program, the government has reduced the lag in reporting the consumer price index and monetary data to one month, and the lag.in reporting budgetary results to within six weeks. A demographic census is scheduled to be carried out in April 2000. M. STAF’F APPRAISAL 69. Macroeconomic performance was broadly in line with the program in the first half of 1999 but has weakened in the third quarter, owing to external factors and policy slippages. White the decline in cocoa prices and the shortfXI in foreign assistance were outside the control of the authorities, the manner in which the retroactive wage increases were paid and domestic capital expenditure accelerated put strong pressure on monetary policy and helped keep interest rates high. The performance of customs was also deficient, as shown by the extremely low effective tariff rate and reported leakages through bonded warehouses. Efforts to maintain reserve money within program limits relied primarily on sales of foreign exchange as opposed to open market operations. As a result, international reserves dwindled, interest rates increased modestly, and the exchange rate adjusted only partially to the external shock. 70. The staff was reassured by the authorities that steps had been taken to reverse the fiscal deterioration in 1999 and strengthen the economy for 2000. The cabinet met during the mission, deliberated on remedial measures, and decided on specific actions, some of which still require parliamentary approval. 71. The staff and the authorities agreed that contingency measures should be clearly identified when preparing the 2000 budget. To curtail low-priority expenditures in 2000, the staff encourages the authorities to follow closely the procedures in their medium-term expenditure framework, which allow for a thorough prioritization of expenditures in consultation with stakeholders. 72. A depreciation of the real effective exchange rate in response to the deterioration of the terms of trade would help the ecammy withstand the external shock. Central bank intervention in excess of program targets, particularly early in the third quarter of 1999, prevented a smooth adjustment of the exchange rate in response to the terms of trade shock ” The real growth rates of GDP are calculated from sector and import data, which were not affected by this revision. Therefore, the main impact of the revision on national accounts has been on their presentation by expenditure. The staffs concerns with the existing national accounts are explained in more detail in Appendix V. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - while depleting its international reserves. The Bank of Ghana should focus primarily on its net foreign assets and reserve money targets, while allowing the exchange rate to find its own level. The staff’s position is that any attempt by the Bank of Ghana to influence exchange rates through intervention would be unproductive and inconsistent with the objectives of the program. For the remainder of the year, the staff expects a faster depreciation of the cedi, as the Bank of Ghana reconstitutes its reserves. Reserve money should be controlled primarily through open market operations, and not through foreign exchange sales. 73. The staff welcomes the steps taken to ensure greater transparency in the foreign exchange market. It urges the authorities to change the method for calculating the market exchange rate and begin monthly publication of the Bank of Ghana’s gross international reserves without delay. It supports the authorities’ request for urgent technical assistance to develop an active interbank market in foreign exchange. 74. Without a more depreciated exchange rate, the decision to maintain the producer price unchanged in the wake of the decline in world cocoa prices will prove to be untenable. While this decision contributed to raising producer incentives, eliminating inequitable export taxes, and reducing rural poverty, it also meant a precipitous cut in government revenue, which will need to be made up urgently. At present exchange rates, the producer price is only profitable for exporters if the cocoa purchased has main crop characteristics. Therefore, the sttiurges the authorities to keep the producer price under review and adopt a producer price system that takes into account the difference in cocoa bean characteristics and their prices in world markets. 75. The divestiture program seems to have lost its momentum, both in terms of completing new divestitures and collecting revenues from previous sales. The government needs to reinvigorate the program and increase its transparency. The recent completion of the sale of the State Transport Company and GHACEM, as well as the offer for sale ofPBC, are positive developments, but they will need to be sustained. The sale of GOB., a state-owned distributor of petroleum products, should be completed as soon as possible and in a fully transparent manner, Divestiture of remaining government shares in banks should be pursued vigorously. 76. Tbe government should move more aggressively to find qualified strategic investors and divest remaining banks. The staff strongly supports the view that banks not complying with capital adequacy requirements should have their licenses revoked, and is encouraged by the authorities’ recent actions in the case of two state-owned banks, the BHC and Coop, which are now in the process of liquidation. The staff believes that, unless efforts to recapitalize the BCC bear fiuit before end-1999, it should also lose its banking license. The staff is encouraged by the measures taken by the supervisory authorities to protect depositors and maintain the soundness of the banking system. However, it urges the authorities to take steps to ensure that all banks Mly comply with prudential requirements. 77. The external shock suffered by the Ghanaian economy in 1999 highlights the vulnerability of its balance of payments. Nontraditional exports need to be supported by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-35- trade liberalisation, macroeconomic stability, and a realistic exchange rate policy. Preliminary analysis based on projected data indicates that Ghana qualities for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. The Fund and World Bank staffs are ready to work with the authorities toward completing the steps to bring Ghana to a decision point in September 2000, if the authorities choose to avail themselves of this possibility. 78. Ghana will require exceptional foreign assistance in 2060 to help cushion the adverse effects of the external shock on the poorest segments of the population, social expenditures, and growth. At a Consultative Group meeting scheduled for late-November 1999, the authorities will present a comprehensive poverty alleviation strategy that will be closely integrated with the overall macroeconomic stance for 2000. The staff encourages development partners to provide the necessary financial support to ensure that this approach is successtbl in a difficult year. In the comext of the ongoing three.-year ESAF arrangement, the statTwill be prepared to propose increased access in 2000 if Ghana demonstrates strong commitment to macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform, and if the balance of payments need is confirmed. 79. The staff is concerned about the increase in instances of corruption mentioned in the press and investigated by the Serious Fraud Offtce, among other agencies. While it is positive that these instances have been uncovered and investigated, their frequency is worrisome. The staff urges the authorities to ensure that instances of corruption are vigorously prosecuted and that the judicial process is not unduly delayed. The government should give high priority to ensuring greater transparency of procurement and divestment procedures, and providing regular and timely reporting of budget execution and of the financial situation of state-owned enterprises. The staff encourages the government to make a public statement condemning the rise in corrupt practices and indicating the measures it intends to take to punish those responsible for them. 80. The timeliness and quality of Ghana’s statistics will need to be markedly improved. The authorities have committed themselves to correct this situation as soon as possible. The staff gives high priority to the implementation of this commitment. 81. The staff encourages the authorities to continue to move expeditiously to ensure that Y2K preparations are completed on time, particularly in critical sectors, such as civil aviation, utilities, health, and banking. 82. The revised program has risks, but if implemented will place Ghana in a strong position to face the challenges of 2000. The success of the program in 1999 relies heavily on the implementation of a major cut in domestic capital expenditures, which will only be achievable if the authorities are correct in their assessment that the cuts decided in July- August are in fir11 effect and will not be reversed. Failure to maintain net domestic financing within program limits for end-1999 would rekindle inflationary pressures and could set in motion wage demands similar to those that derailed adjustment efforts in previous elections years (1992 and 1996). Another crucial condition for the success of the program is a full commitment by the Bank of Ghana to a truly floating exchange rate system without ;..

The exchange rate movements since mid- September indicate that for now the authorities are allowing the exchange rate to move. This policy needs to be continued without hesitation, if the program is to be successful. 83. To reduce risks and ensure that the economy is better prepared in 2000, the authorities carried out a number of prior actions, In view of the measures taken, the staff recommends that waivers be granted for the nonobservance of the June 1999 performance criteria on the primary domestic surplus, net domestic financing, the offer for sale of the Produce Buying Company, the withdrawal of banking licenses from banks that do not meet capital adequacy requirements, as well as the temporary accumulation of external arrears, and that the authorities’ request for modification of performance criteria for December 1999 be granted. 84. The staff recommends that the next Article lV consultation take place on the standard 1Zmonth cycle.

The Executive Board of the Fund approved a three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) arrangement for Ghana on h4ay 3, 1999. The purpose of this letter is to inform you on the progress in implementing the first-year economic program set out in the staffreport (EBS/99/57; 4/16/99) and in the policy framework paper (EBD/99/53; 4/14/99), and to request disbursement of the second loan under the first annual arrangement. 2. In the tirst half of 1999, Ghana suffered an external shock, caused primarily by a shortfall in donor assistance but magn&d by a sharp decline in gold and cocoa prices, on the one hand, and a significant increase in oil prices, on the other. In spite of these difficulties, the government of Ghana is moving ahead with the implementation of its economic program. 3. The external shock made it diicuh for Ghana to comply with all performance criteria under the program. The government of Ghana hereby requests a waiver for non- observance of the following performance criteria for June 1999 and September 1999: (a) net domestic financing of the central government; (b) domestic primary surplus of the government budget; (c) offer for sale of the Produce Buying Company (PBC); (d) withdrawal of banking licenses from banks that do not meet capital adequacy requirements; and (e) elimination of external payments arrears. The government of Ghana also requests modification of the performance criteria for December 1999 relating to the government domestic primary surplus, net domestic financing, reserve money, and the change in net foreign assets of the Bank of Ghana. 4. I am happy to inform you that the government has taken action to expedite the sale of the PBC and clear the external arrears to Italy. The attached memorandum of economic and financial policies of Ghana, based on the policy framework paper referred to above, sets out other remedial measures for 1999 and the key elements of an economic strategy that the government intends to pursue during 2000. 5. The government of Ghana will meet all quantitative and structural benchmarks set for September 1999 under the revised program and will take the actions spelled out in the attached memorandum to underscore its commitment to the program. In support of its 1999-2001 program of economic and financial adjustment, the government hereby requests a second disbursement amounting to SDR 22.14 million, subject to Executive Board approval of the first review under the three-year ESAF arrangement. 6. The government of Ghana will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requests in connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and achieving the objectives of the program. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-51- APPENDIX I 7. The government of Ghana believes that the policies and measures set out in the attached memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of its program; it will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. During the remaining period of the three-year ESAF arrangement, Ghana will continue to consult with the Managing Director on the adoption of any measures that may be appropriate, at the initiative of the government or whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation. Moreover, after the period of the three-year ESAF arrangement and while Ghana has outstanding financial obligations to the Fund arising from loans under the arrangement, the government will consult with the Fund from time to time, at the initiative of the government or whenever the Managing Director requests consultation on Ghana’s economic and financial policies. 8. The government of Ghana will conduct with the Fund the second review of the first annual program supported by the three-year ESAF arrangement, based on performance criteria for end-December 1999, not later than April 30, 2000. 9. The government of Ghana intends to make these understandings public and author&es you to provide this letter and attached memorandum to all interested parties that so request. It also authorizes you to provide to any international organisation providing aid to developing countries that might request it, solely for its own use, the documents related to this request, including this letter and attached memorandum. 10. I can assure you that the government is determined to fully implement the program and comply with the performance criteria. The non observance of the above-mentioned performance criteria of the 1999 program do not reflect a lack of commitment of the Ghanaian authorities, but, instead, unforeseen difficulties. Every effort is being made to quickly carry out the agreements contained in the attached memorandum. 11. We hope that we can count on the continued support of the Fund Sincerely yours, /St Kwame Peprah Minister of Finance Attachment Mr. Michel Camdessus Managing Director International Monetary Fund Washington, D.C. 2043 1 U.S.A.

JNTRODU~~N 1. Ghana is facing a major external shock. World prices of gold and cocoa, Ghana’s main exports, have plummeted, while oil prices have risen sharply. Foreign assistance has fallen significantly short of donor commitments. 2. Even if foreign assistance picks up in the second half of the year, the terms of trade shock is expected to have a serious effect on the economy, despite the widespread use of forward contracts and hedges. In order to cushion the effects of this exogenous shock, the government has taken a number of measures to manage the situation, but it will need additional external financial assistance in 1999-2000 if economic performance is to remain close to government objectives for the period. 3. This memorandum provides a summary of the economic trends in 1999 and prospects for 2000. It reports on what the government has done, and intends to do, in response. It also sets out the general lines of an approach to strengthen the economy, given the unfavorable trends in 1999-2000, including additional measures to help limit the deterioration in the balance of payments and the fiscal position. 4. Despite its own efforts, the government will need the till support of civil society, the parliament, and the donor community if a major setback to Ghana’s economic development is to be avoided. 5. Economic growth appears strong in the first three quarters of 1999. However, fiscal and monetary measures taken in response to the external shock are expected to slow down growth in the last quarter of the year. As a result, real GDP growth for 1999 is expected to fall to about 4.5 percent, despite a good agricultural crop. 6. Up to June 1999, monetary policy remained tight, and both reserve money and broad money were within their target ranges. Annual inflation continued its downward trend from last year, dropping to 12 percent in August, although remaining above projected levels. In particular, food prices declined markedly, outweighing increases in nonfood prices. Revisions of utility prices and retroactive payment of wages-owing to the late completion of the salary negotiations--contributed to slow the downward price trend. For the twelve 12- month period ended in August, the cedi depreciated by 12 percent, about twice as fast as in the previous year. 7. The additional financing of the budget-caused by a foreign assistance shortfall, the decline in cocoa taxes, and nontax revenue and divestiture slippages--is placing significant pressure on monetary policy. While real interest rates have declined since the beginning of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMBNT the year, they remain high. Reserve money expansion in the third quarter was limited by sales of foreign currency by the Bank of Ghana in excess of program targets and by open market operations. 8. The domestic primary surplus for the first half of 1999 was below its projected level by 0.1 percent of GDP; as domestic noninterest spending was about as projected, but lower nontax revenue was not tidly made up by higher collections of direct taxes and cocoa tax. The overall deficit was 0.3 percent of GDP lower than projected, mainly the result of delays in foreign financing for capital expenditure. Road-related arrears are being reduced, although late interest charges are making this effort more challenging than initially planned. The government also did not collect any divestiture receipts. Net domestic financing was 1.1 percent of GDP higher than projected for the midyear, mainly because of delays in foreign program assistance and project loans. Even after adjustment for the shortfall in foreign program assistance, the net domestic financing ceiling under the program is estimated to have been exceeded by 0.2 percent of GDP, 9. In April, the government and civil service. reached agreement on an average wage increase of about 20 percent, as assumed under the program. The increase was applied retroactively to the beginning of the year and became effective in June. Retroactive payments were made in July on account of wages in the first half of the year. In June, the legal framework for the reform of subvented agencies was approved by the cabinet. 10. The value-added tax (VAT) has been in effect from the beginning of the year and is operating well. VAT revenue is on target, mostly because the VAT has few exemptions, a single rate, and covers a larger number of taxpayers than the previous sales tax. 11. Net foreign assets (NPA) of the Bank of Ghana were below program targets at the end of June. However, abler applying program adjusters for the shortfall in foreign program assistance, the net foreign asset position was on target. NPA of the commercial banks have declined considerably as banks have taken advantage of strong credit demand while moving toward greater compliance with the new foreign exchange exposure regulations. 12. Total cocoa purchases in the 1998/99 season are now projected at 396,000 metric tons, about 10 percent above program estimates, However, average cocoa prices declined by 22 percent in 1999. World gold prices fell by 11 percent in the 12-month period ended June 1999. Gold export volume is running slightly above 1998 levels. Available data on imports and exports indicate that both export and import volume growth has been strong. The substantial declines in world prices for Ghana’s two principal exports, cocoa and gold, and the increase in the world price of oil have had a negative impact on Ghana’s external current account. In. STRrJcruFtAL REFORMS 13. Structural reforms have progressed broadly in line with the program. In the financial sector, the Bank of Ghana cancelled the freeze on bank licensing in March 1999. Two well- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-54- APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT known international banks are exploring the possibility of entering the Ghanaian market. Banks not meeting capital adequacy requirements were instructed in March 1999 to invest any increases in deposits in treasury bills and to adhere to monitorable quarterly targets for handling non-performing loans. The National Investment Bank has been asked to adhere to a business plan to strengthen its financial situation and make it a better candidate for divestiture. As part of ongoing efforts to strengthen management, the NIB board has removed from office several senior managers. A new general manager will be hied by the NIB board from a list of professional bankers compiled by the Bank of Ghana. Meanwhile, the Bank of Ghana has reiterated its decision to liquidate banks that do not meet the capital adequacy requirement by end-September. The foreign exchange exposure regulation introduced in December 1998 has been enforced since July. Some banks, however, are not yet in fi~ll compliance with the regulation. The Bank of Ghana has already notified these banks that penalties will be applied. Draft laws for the central bank and the banking system are scheduled for submission to parliament by the end of the year as agreed in the program. 14. In April 1999, the cabinet approved a medium-term cocoa strategy, after extensive consultations with stakeholders. The strategy was published and distributed widely. This strategy was designed to promote competition in the domestic market and end the public monopoly in cocoa exports. Specifically, the Cocoa Board began to provide equal access to its crop financing and warehousing facilities to all licensed buying companies. However, the Produce Buying Company (PBC) had not yet been offered for sale by June 30,1999, as agreed under the program. The government publicly announced in September its intention to offer PBC for sale, and the prospectus will be available shortly, In June, the producer price of cocoa for the 1999/2000 crop season was announced at the same nominal level as in the 1998/99 season despite a sharp decline in cocoa export prices, which raised the producers’ share in the f.o.b. cocoa price to 74 percent, substantially above the 60 percent minimum target under the program. 15. Also in April, the Divestiture Implementation Committee (DIG) published a divestiture work plan, annual targets for divestiture receipts for the period 1999-2001, and a privatization impact assessment done in collaboration with the World Bank. The government is taking steps to complete the divestiture of a number of companies already in the pipeline, including the State Transport Company and GHACEM, a cement factory. Divestiture revenues in the second half of the year are estimated to amount to Q: 80 billion. 16. In the energy sector, the government published in April its “Statement of Power Sector Development Policy” and also posted it on its website. A draft financial restructuring plan for the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) was prepared, and plans to offer TOR for sale before year’s end are on course. 17. On the measurement and reduction of poverty, the government completed the fourth Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS4) in June; it is expected to complete a draft report describing survey results by end-October and present a national program for reducing poverty at the November Consultative Group meeting.

In recent years, trade statistics compiled by Customs, Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) and used by the Bank of Ghana to prepare the balance of payments showed imports significantly lower than those obtained from the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), the Ministry of Trade, and partner countries. ’ An effort to reconcile the data was launched in the frst half of 1999. This review concluded that the manual CEPS data set was incomplete, and, as a result, Ghana’s balance of payments for 1996-98 was revised using import data from GSS and export data from the IMF’s Direction ofTrude Sfa~isrics. The data for travel receipts were replaced by a new series from the Ministry of Tourism. The Bank of Ghana also revised some other series, such as private transfers based on data from commercial banks. Iv. REMEDIAL MEASDRES FOR 1999 19. Fiscal policy will have to be tightened to compensate in part for the foreign assistance shortfall and decline in cocoa tax revenue, as well as for the policy slippages in the first three quarters of 1999. The main adjustment will be a substantial reduction of domestic capital expenditures in the fourth quarter-specifically, from 1.3 percent of GDP in the original program to only 0.4 percent of GDP in the revised program. The VAT Service has been asked to strengthen its effort to enforce compliance with requirements for VAT invoicing and return filing through the application of penalties, automatic assessments of liabilities, and prosecution of nonpayers. Aggressive enforcement of customs procedures, including the close monitoring of bonded warehouses, is also expected to reduce tariff revenue losses. 20. In addition, the government will submit to parliament a package of fiscal measures that is expected to have effect next year: an increase in the VAT rate; enhancement of nontax revenue; increases in petroleum taxes; limitation of exemptions under the VAT and the tariff code; and a reduction of the minimum cocoa prices paid by government to producers for lower-quality beans. The government is also considering limiting capital allowances under the income tax. 21. The government will not seek completion of the second review under the three-year ESAF arrangement until the VAT rate and petroleum tax increases mentioned in paragraph 20 above are decided upon by parliament and implemented. In case parliament decides against the government’s proposal, the government understands that an alternative package of measures acceptable to the Fund will need to be in place before the review can be completed. 22. The government will reduce the top tariff rate from 25 percent to 20 percent in the 2000 budget, in line with regional trends. A comprehensive review ofthe tariff regime is being conducted by government and is expected to be completed in September, as planned. This review has two main objectives: to ensure that Ghana’s tariff system remains competitive with neighboring countries, and to enhance efficiency in production. The government will then adopt and implement the accepted recommendations in the 2000 budget. ’ Based on MF, Direction of Trade Statistics.

In the,third quarter of 1999, the retroactive payment of wages and the increase in government borrowing put strong pressure on monetary policy. Reserve money benchmarks for September had to be revised upward to account for the increase in currency in circulation, while the projection of the net foreign asset position of the Bank of Ghana was revised downward. The Bank of Ghana intends to resume its tight monetary policy in the fourth quarter, aiming at bringing the inflation rate as close to 10 percent .as possible by year’s end. Reserve money growth will be wnstrained to remain at about 12 ‘/i percent, at unchanged velocity assumptions. 24. Given the terms of trade shock and shortfall in foreign program assistance, the Bank of Ghana will be unable to attain its tsrget of raising gross international reserves to 2.7 months of imports as originally programmed.’ To adjust for the external shock, the Bank of Ghana will reduce its net foreign assets target from an increase of USS.77 million down to US%50 million. V. KEYELE~NTSOFANECONOMICSTRUEGYFOR~~~~ 25. Ghana’s external situation is expected to deteriorate in 2000. The price of cocoa exports to be delivered in 2000 is estimated to decline by about 24 percent, compared with 1999. Export receipts will increase by only 2 percent, despite increases in export volumes and rising levels of nontraditional exports. Therefore, the capacity of the economy to import will be. limited. While the government hopes to obtain additional assistance &om its development partners to minimize the external constraint, imports may be able to increase by 7.2 percent only (in value terms). Under the circumstances, the government believes that the real GDP growth projections may have to be scaled down to 4 percent in 2000. The government will target the inflation rate at or below 8 percent. 26. To maintain macroeconomic stability in the face of this externally imposed constraint, fiscal and monetary policies will need to be restrictive. Increases in the VAT rate and petroleum taxes, improvements in customs administration, and the use of a two-price structure for cocoa producer prices are projected to raise domestic revenue to 18.1 percent of GDP. Noninterest recurrent expenditure is expected to be cut by 0.1 percentage points of GDP to 10.3 percent. The domestic primary surplus is expected to remain level at 3.4 percent of GDP, and the overall fiscal deficit (on a commitment basis) will be 6.7 percent of GDP. The government is appealing to its development partners to increase their contribution to the financing of the budget deficit, particularIy through program grants, so as to limit net domestic financing of government to no more than 2.4 percent of GDP. 27. These fiscal targets were chosen based on the assumption that foreign assistance will increase considerably in 2000, as described in paragraph 29 below. The government will define contingency measures and adjustment scenarios to be used in case foreign assistance falls short of the values assumed in this memorandum. ’ Gross reserves in U.S. dollar terms did not increase by as much as targeted, and imports have been significantly revised upward. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-57- APPENDIX1 ATTACHMENT 28. Monetary expansion for 2000 will be limited to 12 percent, in line with present expectations for real growth and the inflation target. Assuming a slightly higher money multiplier, reserve money growth will be limited to 11.5 percent. The Bank of Ghana will keep the reserve money on target through open market operations; interest rates are expected to adjust as needed to ensure adherence to the monetary program. Credit to the private sector is expected to increase by 15.8 percent, in line with the expansion of nominal GDP. 29. Given the relatively low level of gross international reserves expected at the end of 1999 (two months of imports), the Bank of Ghana will focus its intervention in the foreign exchange market on its net foreign assets target while leaving the determination of the exchange rate to market forces. The level of gross reserves will decline to the equivalent of not less than two months of imports. 30. The government will convene a Consultative Group (CC) meeting in November 1999, under the sponsorship of the World Bank, in which it will present its strategy for poverty reduction and discuss its financing requirements for 2000. The government’s preliminary estimate of financing needs for 2000, excluding World Bank assistance, is US%769 million, of which at least LJS$241 million are needed in program grants and loans. World Bank assistance in 2000 is estimated at USS230 million. The government requests the IMF to consider providing additional resources under the present ESAF arrangement in the context of the next annual program. 31. The government is also considering the establishment of a domestic debt fimd to reduce the burden of domestic debt, which at end-1998 amounted to 100 percent of government domestic revenue, with interest payments reaching 28 percent. Present estimates indicate that contributions from donors amounting to US%50 million a year, for a period of at least three years, could be sought to reduce the domestic debt service, with some of the savings from debt relief being for social programs. These contributions will need to be in addition to the amounts mentioned in paragraph 29. 32. The government intends to develop an active interbank market in foreign exchange and would like to request assistance from the Fund in the form of an expert with experience in setting up such a market in a developing country. Technical assistance is also needed to help the Bank of Ghana improve its balance of payment statistics. VL PRIORACTIONSANDPWGRAM MOMTORWG 33. Prior actions. The government will take prior actions to underscore its commitment to resolve the economic difliculties caused by the adverse world price trends. It will meet all quantitative and structural benchmarks set for September 1999 under the revised program. It will offer PBC for sale and eliminate all external arrears by end-September 1999. Prior to the completion of the first review of the current ESAF arrangement, scheduled for November, the government will seek parliamentary approval for an increase in the value added tax rate. It will provide an assessment of the factors that led to the loss of merchandise from bonded warehouses, together with an estimate of the resulting revenue losses, steps to identify and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 58 - APPENDIX1 ATTACHMENT prosecute those responsible, and measures taken to prevent recurrence of such incidents in the future. More generally, the government will indicate the measures it will take to strengthen customs. It will complete the steps to divest the State Transport Company and GHACEM, a cement factory. The Bank of Ghana will calculate the market exchange rate based on commercial bank transactions reported to the central bank, and not from indicative rates quoted by commercial banks. 34. Performance criteria. Performance through end-1999 will be monitored on the basis of the following benchmarks (for September 1999) and quantitative performance criteria (for December 1999): (a) domestic primary balance of the government budget; (b) government revenue;3 (c) net domestic financing of the government budget; (d) reserve money; (e) net foreign assets of the Bank of Ghana; (f) new nonconcessional external borrowing; and (B) the stock of external short-term debt (Table 1). The nonaccumulation of new external payments arrears will also constitute a performance criterion, applying on a continuous basis. Structural performance criteria and benchmarks are shown in Table 2. 35. Provision of information. In order to ensure effective monitoring of the program, the government will continue to make available to Fund staff all core data on a timely basis, including the set of weekly indicators of financial policies described in our memorandum of economic and financial policies dated April 14, 1999. In addition, starting in the third quarter of 1999, the Bank of Ghana will release to the public monthly information on its gross international reserves, with a delay of not more than a month. The GSS, in collaboration with CEPS, the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Tourism, will publish monthly data on exports, imports and tourist arrivals with a lag of not more than 60 days. Summary information on the results of the GLSS4 will be provided to the Fund staff before the end of October. Publication of the Quarterb Digest ofStatistics of the GSS and the Bank of Ghana Quarter& Economic Bulletin will be kept current, with publishing delays of not more than 60 days, starting in the third quarter of 2000. The backlog of unpublished issues will be eliminated by the end of 1999. Publication delays owing to printing will be minimized by posting the data to a website. 3 Benchmark only.

The objective of the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY 98-FY 00 is to support the key elements of the government’s development agenda, which seeks to improve the quality of life.for all Ghanaians, generate employment and growth, and reduce poverty. The Bank’s broad strategy objectives include: restoring macroeconomic stability, promoting private investment, supporting social and rural development, and implementing direct poverty alleviation measures. Ghana is one of the pilot countries for the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF). As part of this initiative, a series of donor coordination activities have been launched in the field that will help the formulation of the next CAS for FY 99-FY 01 in early 2000. 2. As ofJuly 12, 1999, total commitments to Ghana amounted to USS1,197.4 million with total disbursements of US.8655.4 million. Over the three-year period covering FY 98-FY 00, the Bank’s base case-lendiig program has a range of US8430 to USS650 million. Within this range, the Bank has followed a graduated response to changes in key indicators with respect to fiscal sustainability, portfolio performance, and structural reforms. In addition, the IFc’s portfolio totals 22 projects, for total commitments of USS57.9 million, of which US%53.6 million have been disbursed. 3. Recent and proposed Bank Group projects have broad sectoral coverage, including roads and other it&structure, health, education, agriculture, environment, private sector development, and public sector management. These projects emphasize rehabilitation, maintenance, and institutional strengthening. More reliance is being put on supporting sector- wide programs and nonlenrlmg services. The Bank is moving away from infrastructure investments in telecommunications, power, ports, rails, and large urban water systems, while providing greater nonlending support (enhanced by IFC and MIGA) to promote private participation in these sectors. 4. Since the formulation of Ghana’s Economic Recovery Program in 1983, the Bank has provided a series of policy-based credits to help finance urgently needed imports and support structural reforms, including liberaliition of the exchange rate, trading system, and prices; rationalixation of public expenditures; privatixation; and parastatal reform. In the early 19909, several adjustment credits were approved-a second financial sector adjustment credit; an agriculture sector adjustment credit; and a private sector adjustment credit-in support of a tln-ther deepening of reforms and of the government’s accelerated divestiture program. More recent investment credits have been used to fmance education and health. In FY 98, a ona tranche adjustment credit, the Economic Reform Support Operation, was also approved. In FY 99, the Bank approved a second Economic Reform Support Operation adjustment credit in the amount ofUS$lSO million.

The African Development Bank (AfDB) started lending to Ghana in 1973. As of September 30, 1999, the AtDB Group’ had provided financial assistance amounting to SDR 542.23 million in support of 45 operations, comprising 36 projects, six studies, and one institutional support project. The AfDB resources have iimded 18 projects for a cumulative total of SDR 210.55 million, including one project cofinsnced withNTF and two other projects with AfDF. The AfDFITechnical Assistance Fund (TAF) resources have funded 30 operations for a cumulative total of SDR 329.41 million. NTF has cofinanced one project with AfDB for SDR 2.27 million. 2. The AfDB Group’s lending activities in Ghana have been mainly in the agricultural and industrial sectors, both ofwhich account for about 58.5 percent of commitments. Loans to the public utilities, transport, and social sectors, as well as the multisector loans, comprise remaining commitments. As regards the ongoing operations, the sectoral breakdown shows that the agriculture and social sectors dominate the portfolio, with ten projects accounting for 66.13 percent of total active loans and grants. The remaining five operations are in the transport, industry, and public utilities sectors. 3. The assistance provided since 1994 includes 7 AtDF loans and 3 TAF grants. Loans have been provided to finance (a) a food crops development project to improve the overall nutritional status and standard of living of the rural population; (b) a small-scale irrigation project, also aimed at increasing production and productivity of crops; (c) a health services rehabilitation project in support of the national primary health care program; (d) the economic reform program; (e) a primary education project aimed at assisting disadvantaged communities in northern Ghana; (f) the rehabilitation of the Achimota-Anyhutm road in order to improve the flow of traffic between Accra, the capital city, and Kumasi, the major inland economic city, and into Burkina Faso, a neighboring country; and (g) a poverty-reduction project for facilitating access of the poor to basic economic and social infrastructure and financial services. The grants were provided for carrying out a roads study; financing a study aimed at increasing investments in the agro-industry subsector; and financing an institutional support operation aimed at strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Finance and related economic organs to formulate economic policy, manage national debt, and monitor the implementation of development projects. 4. The AfDB Group’s lending strategy is to provide assistance aimed at poverty reduction and to encourage the government to continue to pursue its ongoing economic reforms within the Comprehensive Development Framework. Assistance for poverty-reduction efforts will be channeled through direct pro-poor interventions in new operations in the social and agriculture sectors. Under this strategy, a second policy-based operation in support of ongoing economic reforms that enhance growth and reduce poverty is expected to begin in 2000. ’ The AfDB Group consists of the African Development Bank (AtDB), African Development Fund (AfDF), and the Nigerian Trust Fund (NTF).

Ghana is in the bottom quartile of Fund members in timeliness of reporting core surveillance data. This situation is a source of great concern. Improvements in the quality and timeliness of Ghana’s statistics should be given high priority by the government. Areas where improvements need to be made are identified below. National accounts 2. The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) is the agency responsible for compiling national accounts statistics in Ghana, which were published in the Quur&r& Digest of Statistics until 1992, when publication was halted. From 1992 until the fall of 1998, only estimates of GDP by sectors were provided to the staff In the absence of official GDP data by expenditure category, the Fund stti developed its own estimates on the basis of available information on the fiscal accounts and the balance of payments. 3. In 1996, the GSS received technical assistance from the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID) through the assignment of a resident national accounts statistician. The objective of the assistance was to revise new national accounts estimates using 1993 weights, based on information collected for the third Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS), instead of the 1975 weights that had been used so &r. The resident statistician was also expected to help with the estimation of GDP by expenditure category. 4. In September 1998, a complete set of national accounts for the years 1993 to 1996 was published by the Ghana Statistical Service. However, the methodology used in preparing the data has not been published. Estimates of GDP by sectors had been revised to account for use of 1993 weights, which resulted in downward revisions by about 5 percentage points and 20 percentage points of the sector weights for agriculture and services, respectively, and an upward revision of 12 percentage points for industry. The national accounts series was not revised backward beyond 1993, resulting in large discontinuities in the series between 1992 and 1993. 5. The staff also noted large discrepancies between the import data used for the national accounts and those used for the balance of payments. For 1997, the discrepancy in merchandise imports was close to US$l billion in c.i.f. terms. Moreover, the behavior of some deflators did not seem consistent with available price indicators. For example, the deflator for investment, described to the staff as a weighted average of the building and construction price index and the consumer price index (CPI), was found to significantly exceed both of these indices. In this context, the staff asked the Ghanaian authorities to (a) reconcile the trade data between the national accounts and the balance of payments; (b) review the deflators for errors in their calculation; and (c) provide the staff with a description of the methodology used to compile the national accounts. The authorities completed the first item (see below for details). The revision of the deflators resulted only in a change for the 1997 investment deflator, which does not resolve the staffs concerns. A summary description of the national accounts Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public, - 75 - APPENDIX V methodology is expected to be provided to the staff in October. Meanwhile, the staffis using the national accounts by sectors provided by the GSS, but has continued to compile its own estimates of national accounts by expenditure category. 6. The statf believes that additional technical assistance in the compilation of national accounts statistics is urgently needed, furthermore, this assistance should focus primarily on developing and implementing updated statistical surveys that could-be used to compile better estimates of value added by sector and ensuring that appropriate deflators are used in the compilation of the national accounts. Prices 7. In January 1998, a new CPI was introduced. The weights are computed according to the standard consumption basket estimated from the 1992 GLSS. The new basket reduced the weight of clothing from 19 percent to 9 percent, while the weights for medical care, housing, and transport were increased. A set of comparable indices based on the new consumption basket is available only after September 1997, and, consequently, the authorities used a spline method, by compounding inflation, to estimate the 12-month inflation rate from January to September 1998. The wholesale price index was discontinued in 1991. Labor statistics 8. Labor statistics in Ghana are produced with a considerable lag, and wage statistics are nearly nonexistent. To reduce delays, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the International Labor Organ&ion (ILO) are providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Employment. Wage indicators rue not generally available, although some series can be obtained from the Social Security National Insurance Trust (SSNIT). Trade statistics 9. Trade data are reported with gaps, and the most recent figures for total exports and imports in Internaiional Fimmciul Sfaiistics (ZFS) relate to 1998. Large discrepancies exist between import data reported by the GSS and a manual compilation of import data prepared by the Customs, Excises, and Preventive Service (CEPS) and used by the Bank of Ghana to compile the balance of payments. A reconciliation effort was carried out in 1999 at the request of the staff After a review of the situation, the staff and the authorities concluded that the trade statistics in the balance of payments were underestimating both imports and exports. 10. Regarding imports, the manual data prepared by CEPS, which was used by the Bank of Ghana for the balance of payments owing to their timely availability, were found to be seriously deficient. The alternative data set compiled by GSS from computer&d information obtained from the ASYCUDA customs system was found to be more reliable. This data set is broadly consistent with the information obtained from partner countries and with another trade data set compiled independently and maintained by the Ministry of Trade. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-76- APPENDIXV 11. Regarding exports, the data set used by the Bank of Ghana for balance of payments was found to include some netting of imported inputs (particularly in the case of VALCO, a large aluminum producer) and, therefore, to underestimate exports. Export statistics compiled by the Ministry of Trade through the Customs Export Data Information System, a joint effort of the Ministry of Trade and CEPS, were found to be broadly in line with partner countries’ data. These data are published in the annual reports of the GhaM Export BuIIe:in; unpublished data are available with a lag of three months. The staff believes that these data should be used for the compilation of both national accounts and balance of payments statistics. 12. Unit value and volume indices for total exports and imports are no longer supplied to the Statistics Department (STA). The staifcalculates its own export price index from prices of main commodity exports and uses a weighted average of partner country export prices as an indicator of import prices. 13. The authorities have agreed that the GSS will publish monthly trade statistics with a delay of not more than 60 days. Public finance 14. The timeliness of the reporting of public finance statistics was improved by the introduction in 1994 of a new expenditure coding system that allows data to be generated on a cash basis from the central bank records. However, an economic classhication of expenditures is available only with a lag of at least two months. Expenditure data on a commitment basis are not available, but efforts have recently been made to get large ministries to report their expenditure commitments and arrears to the Ministry of Finance. Expenditures fhranced by externally funded project aid are produced with a considerable lag and are subject to estimation errors, owing to timing differences, foreign exchange valuation, and the recording of the technical assistance component. Staff estimates of these expenditures are derived from balance of payments data. Consolidated fiscal accounts are not compiled because data on autonomous government agencies (subvented agencies) and public enterprises are not reported. A World Bank mission reviewed the government’s domestic debt data in August 1998. 15. Annual government iinance data were reported for publication in the Govemmenr Finance Sfutistics Yearbook (GFSY), but the coverage and timeliness of the data need to be improved; the latest available data cover the central government only and relate to the fiscal year ended December 3 1, 1993. Unless the authorities update the GFS data this year, the country page will be scheduled for deletion in GFSY. These data include sll the major components of the government finance statistics tables, with the exception of debt, for which the latest data published in the GFSYrelate to 1985. The authorities reported fiscal data for the 1996 GFSY, but the data could not be published as they were not sufticiently detailed to allow conversion to the government finance statistics format. No monthly or quarterly data Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-77- APPENDIX V are reported for publication in IFS. Debt statistics 16. With technical assistance from the Commonwealth Secretariat, significant improvements have been made in the debt-reporting system, although reconciliation of data between the Bank of Ghana and the Ministry of Finance still presents problems; nevertheless, efforts are being made to achieve tinther progress in this area. Statistics compiled by the Bank of Ghana 17. Monetary sturistics. Monetary data are compiled on a regular basis. In December 1997, the monetary survey was extended to include 6 additional banks; it thus currently covers all 17 banks in the system. Notwithstanding the technical assistance provided since 1985, several problems persist in Ghana’s monetary statistics. In particular, there are large deviations between data reported by commercial banks with respect to their deposits with the central bank and those reported by the Bank of Ghana. Moreover, foreign currency accounts are not valued at the end-of-period market exchange rates. A STA money and banking statistics mission (July 1997) proposed a plan of action and a timetable to resolve these problems. Among the issues that need to be addressed is the classification by residency of foreign currency deposits in commercial banks. A follow-up STA mission is scheduled for the first quarter of 2000. 18. Balance ofpayments. Balance of payments data are published only annually. Balance of payments estimates up to 1997 have been submitted to STA. In September 1999, faced with large discrepancies in the trade statistics obtained from different sources, the stti, in collaboration, with the authorities, made a number of revisions in the balance of payments statistics of Ghana. The main revisions made were the following: (a) the trade statistics were changed to reflect the best source for trade data available (see above); (b) related services, such as freight and insurance, were revised accordingly; (c) the old series on travel receipts was replaced by a new one compiled by the Ministry of Tourism; and (d) the statistics on private transfers were revised on the basis of more detailed data obtained by the Bank of Ghana from commercial banks. 19. A technical assistance mission to review the proposed changes has been urgently requested by the authorities. A number of methodological issues have been identified to be covered by this mission, including issues related to coverage, valuation, and residency. The treatment of financial derivatives, including hedges, is another area deserving attention. 20. Economic indicutms. The central bank is also computerizing its databases, particularly with regard to economic indicators, in consultation with the Fund. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-78- APPENDIXV Publication 12. The reporting of data to the Fund for purposes of publication in the IFS has recently improved. However, there are still lags of about four to five months in reporting exchange rates, prices, and international transactions data. In general, statistical information from official sources is not disseminated to the public on a timely basis. Even though the QuurterZy Economic Bulletin of rhe Bunk of Ghana is now published more regularly, the data show lags of up to six months. The Quarterly Digest of Statistics is usually published by the GSS with a longer lag. The government has agreed to take steps to ensure that both quarterly bulletins will be published regularly, with a lag of not more than 60 days. 13. Deficiencies in data dissemination have been brought to the attention of the Ghanaian authorities at the level of the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Bank of Ghana, and the Government Statistician.
