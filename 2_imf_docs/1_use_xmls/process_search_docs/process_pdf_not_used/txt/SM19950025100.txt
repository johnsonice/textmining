Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with France were held June 28 to July 10, 1995. l/ The staff team met with the then-Minister of the Economy and Finance, Mr. Madelin, and with senior officials of the Ministry. At the Banque de France, the mission was received by Governor Trichet. The staff also met with the Commissioner General for Planning, and with senior representatives of the Ministries of Labor and Social Affairs. Messrs. Autheman and Sirat, Executive and Alternate Executive Director for France, respectively, alternated in participating in the discussions. The last Article IV Consultation with France was concluded by the Executive Board on September 7, 1994 (EBM/94/80). At that time, Directors welcomed indications that France was now well into economic recovery, but expressed concern that GDP growth might not by itself be sufficient to achieve an adequate increase in employment. To reduce the high rate of unemployment, Directors called for a lowering of the high social charges on labor income, more effective training programs, and other structural measures. They also noted that the general government deficit was well above the average of major industrial countries, and recommended a policy of resolute expenditure restraint to achieve the targets of the Convergence Plan. Most Directors thought that the weight given to exchange rate stability was essential to maintaining the credibility of monetary policy and to achieving the objective of European monetary union. The presidential elections concluded in May 1995 brought to office the Gaullist candidate Jacques Chirac, following fourteen years of Socialist Presidency under Francois Mitterand. Parliament has already been controlled by a conservative coalition since 1993; new parliamentary elections are not 1/ The staff team consisted of Messrs. Artus (head), Baumgartner, Bismut, Habermeier, and Levy (all EUl), Mr, Agenor (RES), and Mrs. Clark (Administrative Assistant, EUl).

The periodicity, timeliness, coverage, and quality of France's economic data is fully adequate for effective surveillance (see Annex III). It is intended to issue a supplement to this report following a staff visit in late September after the announcement of the 1996 budget. II. Background For over a decade France has pursued an economic policy geared to achieving low inflation and establishing the strong anti-inflation credibility enjoyed by some of its European partners (Chart 1). This stability-oriented policy has been seen as a key condition for France's participation in European economic integration and monetary union. Linking the franc to the strong ERM currencies, notably the deutsche mark, has been the anchor of this policy. Despite very low inflation in the past few years, the credibility of this policy has yet to be fully established as shown by the recurrent episodes of severe pressure on the franc since mid- 1992. This credibility is affected by two fundamental weaknesses in economic performance: high unemployment and a large fiscal deficit. From the first oil shock to 1987, the unemployment rate rose steeply and without interruption, from 3 percent to 10 l/2 percent of the labor force (Chart 2). Following a decline in the cyclical upswing in the late 198Os, the unemployment rate resumed its climb during the subsequent recession, reaching 12 l/2 percent in mid-1994. While this latest jump was largely cyclical, the reasons for the underlying trend increase in unemployment are structural, including high non-wage labor costs and a high minimum wage, generous social welfare and unemployment benefits, shortcomings in training, and labor market rigidities. The deterioration in the public finances is a more recent development, dating from the late 1980s and early 1990s (Chart 3). The structural deficit of the general government widened from only 1 percent of GDP in 1987 to close to 4 percent of GDP in 1993 due to tax reductions and the tendency of social expenditure to increase more quickly than potential GDP. With the effect of the economic cycle, the general government deficit rose from 2 percent in 1987 to 6 percent of GDP in 1993. Against this background, the objective of fiscal policy in the past two years was to reduce public sector deficits to meet the convergence criteria for participation in Economic and Monetary Union. This objective was set out in the convergence plan submitted to the EU Council in November 1993, which envisaged a gradual reduction in the general government deficit to 2 percent of GDP by 1997. In line with this plan, the five-year guidance law adopted in early 1994 for the central government envisaged a target path for the deficit to be achieved largely by holding real expenditure constant. Actual developments in 1994-95, however, fell substantially short of the fiscal consolidation objectives.

Real GDP increased by an average of 3 percent in 1994, and by 4 percent fourth quarter over fourth quarter (Chart 4 and Table 1). However, the pace of growth slowed to an annualized rate of 2 l/4 percent in the first half of 1995. Private consumption was weak early in the year, but strengthened substantially in the second quarter, partly reflecting a bunching of car purchases prior to the expiry at the end of June of special incentives introduced in 1994. By contrast, fixed investment, in particular in transport equipment, declined in the second quarter following strong growth in the first three months. Political uncertainties and higher short- term interest rates may have played a role in this decline. After rapid growth in late 1994 and early 1995, exports slowed sharply in the second quarter in line with the weakening of growth in European partner countries. Mirroring the strong upturn in activity, non-farm employment began to rise in the course of 1994, and has grown by 2.2 percent in the 15 months to June 1995. Consequently, the unemployment rate fell to 11.4 percent by July 1995. Wages have thus far remained subdued. Gross compensation per employed person increased by 2.3 percent in 1994, and unit labor costs for the overall economy remained flat. Consumer price inflation, which was relatively low even at the peak of the previous cycle, fell further during the recession and the early stages of the recovery. In 1994, consumer prices increased by only 1.7 percent. Even though an increase in the tax on petroleum products at the beginning of 1995 pushed up the price level, the effect was temporary, and the 12-month growth rate fell back to 1.5 percent by July 1995. The 1994 central government budget envisaged a deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP (including privatization receipts), based on nominal expenditure growth of 1.9 percent. Although the deficit target was met, spending increased by more than 3 percent, largely as a result of a generous public sector wage settlement and increased outlays on a variety of social and employment programs. The higher expenditures were, however, offset by more buoyant revenues, as output and employment growth exceeded initial expectations. The central government deficit, excluding privatization receipts and other financial transactions, was close to 5 percent of GDP in 1994, and the social security funds remained in sizable deficit (1.0 percent of GDP). Overall, the general government deficit held stable at 6 percent of GDP, 1/ rather than declining to 5.1 percent of GDP as projected in the convergence plan. The central go-vernment budget for 1995 called for a further reduction in the deficit, to 3.5 percent of GDP (or 4.2 percent excluding privatization receipts).

To offset these slippages and to finance additional measures to combat unemployment, a supplementary budget was introduced in mid-year (see below). The finances of the social security funds have also developed less favorably than expected, partly as a consequence of more generous exemptions from social security contributions enacted to stimulate the employment of low-skilled persons. With these slippages, the target of the 1993 convergence plan to reduce the general government deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP in 1995 is now out of reach (see below). With calm returning to foreign exchange markets fo,llowing the turbulence in mid-1993, the Banque de France lowered its policy rates in late 1993 and in the first half of 1994, broadly in line with developments in Germany (Chart 5). Short-term market interest rates declined and the differential vis-A-vis Germany was generally not more than 50 basis points in 1994 (Chart 6). Long-term interest rates moved broadly in line with international conditions, with rates rising by about 3 percentage points in the course of 1994. Close to the elections, tensions in the foreign exchange markets erupted again and the franc dropped sharply. From March until May 1995, the franc was 4 to 6 l/2 percent below its central parity in terms of the deutsche mark, compared with a maximum of 2 l/4 percent during 1994 (Chart 7). While the franc weakened against the mark, it appreciated against the U.S. dollar and some European currencies, thus rising slightly in real effective terms. To counter the depreciation of the franc against the deutsche mark, the Banque de France suspended its 5-10 day repurchase facility at 6.4 percent and replaced it by a one-day facility at 8.0 percent in early March (reducing the rate to 7.75 percent in early April), while leaving the intervention rate unchanged at 5.0 percent. In the second half of June, around the time of the announcement of the supplementary budget for 1995, the Banque de France reopened the 5-10 day repo facility at a rate of 7.50 percent. This rate has since been lowered repeatedly and stood at 6.15 percent in early September, bringing the short-term interest rate differential vis-a-vis Germany to 1 l/2 - I 3/4 percentage points, down from more than 3 l/2 percentage points in March-April. Concurrently, the franc has appreciated to within 2 l/2 percent of the central parity. As shown in Chart 8, the yield curve remains slightly inverted at the short end. The external current account remained in surplus at about 3/4 percent of GDP in 1994. The capital account showed substantial net outflows of long-term capital (mainly bonds), which were more than offset by short-term inflows (mainly in the banking sector). Consequently, the foreign assets of the Banque de France increased (by about US$ 15 billion) in the course of 1994. The current account remained in surplus in early 1995, accompanied by further net outflows of long-term capital. Gross foreign assets of the Banque de France rose by US$ 2 l/2 billion in the first eight months of 1995, largely reflecting valuation changes.

Both the authorities and the staff expected real GDP to increase by about 3 percent in 1995, inflation to remain near 2 percent (annual average) despite an increase in the VAT, I/ and unemployment to decline slowly. These projections assumed a continued economic recovery in Europe and the United States. The staff estimates that the projected rate of growth would result in an output gap of about 2 l/4 percent in 1995. 2/ The authorities noted that consumer confidence strengthened during the second quarter, and that consumption was supported by the acceleration in disposable income brought about by strong employment growth (Chart 9). Even so, at 2 l/2 percent for the year, real consumer spending was expected to grow more slowly than income. Since the autumn of 1994, survey data consistently indicated that business intended a large increase in investment in 1995. With the ratio of investment to GDP still well below its pre-recession level, capacity utilization already close to its long-term average, the outlook for external demand remaining favorable, and interest rates falling, the decline in business investment in the second quarter was probably only a pause in an expansion which would resume in the second half of the year. By contrast, residential construction was expected to be weak, reflecting a glut of older commercial buildings, many of which were now slated to be converted into apartments. While the upturn of export voiwne has slowed somewhat in recent months from the 16 percent annual rate seen in late 1994, exports are expected to grow by about 7 percent in 1995, broadly in line with the increase in partner country demand. Imports have picked up in the second quarter of 1995, and the staff and the authorities both thought it likely that, for the remainder of the year, imports would grow at about twice the rate of total domestic demand. Overall, the contribution of the foreign balance to GDP growth would be slightly positive in 1995, and the current account would remain in surplus (1 percent of GDP). 1;/ As discussed below the standard rate of VAT was raised from 18.6 percent to 20.6 percent with effect from August 1. The staff assumes that this increase would impart a 1 percent once-off boost to the price level. The authorities thought that the effect might be somewhat smaller. 2/ The authorities did not provide an estimate of the output gap in 1995. On the basis of a variety of different methodologies, their estimates for 1994 ranged from 1 l/2 percent to 3 percent versus a staff estimate of 3 l/2 percent. The staff's calculation of an output gap of 2 l/4 percent in 1995 is based on an estimate of the NAIRU of 9 l/4 percent of the labor force. The latter estimate, in particular, is subject to a number of caveats (see the forthcoming background paper on the output gap and the NAIRU).

The staff thought that the figure could be somewhat lower in 1996, on the order of 2 3/4 percent. This projection entailed a slight further increase in private consumption and investment, offset by a deceleration of exports. Private consumption would be sustained by a non-inflationary acceleration of wages and continued growth of employment, which would more than offset the effect of the VAT increase. The carryover effect from the VAT rate increase in 1995 would temporarily push the annual average rate of CPI inflation to 2.3 percent in 1996 (with the underlying rate remaining just below 2 percent). For 1997-2000, the staff would envisage a rate of growth of real GDP of 2 3/4 percent per year, somewhat above estimated potential growth of 2 l/4 percent, leading to a closing of the output gap toward the end of the period. Despite the continuation of economic expansion and recent measures to stimulate employment, the unemployment rate would fall only very gradually to 11 percent in 1996 and 9 percent in the medium-term. A steeper decline would require additional labor market measures to reduce structural unemployment. As discussed below, on current policies, fiscal adjustment would be relatively slow, with the general government deficit remaining above 3 percent of GDP by 1997. Uncertainty with respect to the observance of the convergence criterion for the general government deficit in time for participation in stage III of EMU could lead to turbulence in the foreign exchanges, increases in interest rates, weaker business and consumer confidence, and a slower economic expansion. This risk is not taken into account in the baseline scenario lJ, which assumes that the short-term interest rate differential vis-a-vis Germany continues to decline, to about 1 percentage point (average) in 1996 and l/4 percentage point in 1997. Such a development would be in line with broadly similar inflation rates and cyclical conditions in the two countries. To avoid the risk of a crisis, the staff has recommended faster fiscal consolidation (as in the adjustment scenario presented below), which implies a larger withdrawal of fiscal stimulus (by a total of 1 l/4 percentage point of GDP) in 1996-97 compared with the baseline scenario. Standard macro- economic models (including MULTIMOD) would show a small negative impact on growth in the short-term followed by small longer-term gains (see Annex II). In the current circumstances, however, such simulations are misleading, because they underestimate the sensitivity of financial markets to fiscal developments. In particular, they do not take into account that the adverse short-run effects on output of faster fiscal adjustment could well pale in comparison with those of markets lacking confidence that fiscal 1/ The baseline scenario is identical to that of the updated August World Economic Outlook exercise.

Uncertainty with respect to the adequacy of fiscal adjustment could lead to higher interest rates and a vicious cycle of lower economic growth, higher unemployment, lower tax revenues, and higher interest payments on a larger public debt. V. Policy Discussion The new government is determined to reduce unemployment by fostering a sustainable economic recovery and addressing the structural causes of unemployment. It believes that fiscal consolidation is consistent with this objective. In particular, fiscal adjustment would reassure markets that France would meet the pre-conditions for participation in stage III of EMU by 1997. This should contribute to achieving a further improvement in market sentiment concerning the franc, which is key to a lasting reduction in short-term interest rates and a more balanced policy mix. As the staff agreed with this broad policy strategy, most of the discussion concerned the nature and magnitude of the fiscal and labor market measures that would be required. 1. Fiscal policy As discussed above, the general government deficit of 6.0 percent of GDP in 1994 was substantially above the target of 5.1 percent of GDP established in the convergence plan, with the growth of central government expenditure of 3.5 percent also having been well in excess of the norm of zero real growth spelled out in the five-year budget law (Table 2). Although the economic recovery was much stronger than expected, virtually no use was made of the cyclical upswing in 1994 to improve the fiscal position, and France fell behind other countries in pursuing fiscal consolidation. Against the background of further budgetary slippages in 1995 and to finance additional employment measures, the new government presented a supplementary budget in June. It aims to maintain the central government deficit at 4 l/4 percent of GDP. 1/ The supplementary budget raised the rate of the standard VAT from 18.6 percent to 20.6 percent with effect from August 1, and introduced surcharges of 10 percent on the corporate income tax and the wealth tax. (It was indicated that the tax increases could be reversed once the general government deficit falls below 3 percent of GDP). The increase in revenue from these measures is estimated at F 31 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) in 1995. At the same time, central government expenditures of F 19 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) were cut from the initial budget. These revenue and expenditure measures are to compensate for expenditure overruns of F 35 billion (0.5 percent of GDP), a small net I/ This deficit definition excludes privatization receipts in line with the new government's decision to exclude such receipts from fiscal targets. The general government definition used here and for purposes of observing the Maastricht convergence criterion also excludes privatization receipts.

On a full year basis, the tax increases of F 60 billion, 0.8 percent of GDP, esceed the estimated amount of employment measures of F 35 billion, 0.S percent of GDP. The authorities expected that the general government deficit would fall to about 5 percent of GDP in 1995, with the deficit of the social security system remaining broadly unchanged at just below 1 percent of GDP. This estimate implies a structural deficit of about 3 l/2 percent of GDP. At the time of the mission, the formulation of fiscal policy beyond 1995 was still at an early stage. The authorities emphasized, however, that they were firmly committed to meeting the Maastricht criterion for the general government deficit by 1997. At a minimum, they envi.saged reducing the deficit to 4 percent of GDP in 1996 and 3 percent of GDP in 1997. l/ The authorities believed that, provided the economic expansion continued for another two years, achieving the deficit target for 1997 would be possible with tight expenditure restraint at the central government level, and elimination of the deficit of the social security system. It was expected that a new medium-term fiscal consolidation program would be announced with the 1995 budget in September. The authorities acknowledged that eliminating the deficits of the social security funds (health care, pensions, and family allowances) would be a very difficult task, given the powerful role played by social partners and the strong tradition of comprehensive social protection in France. Overall, trend growth of social security expenditure, at constant prices, was about 3 percent per year, in excess of the growth of potential output. Thus, there was not only a large deficit to begin with but also an underlying tendency toward growing deficits. At the time of the discussions, the new government, however, had not yet formulated a policy strategy in this area. Health care is a major part of the problem. Health care expenditure as a share of GDP (9 percent) is higher in France than in other EU countries, and health care insurance accounts for about half of the social security deficit. Public hospitals, doctors and other providers of health care services have been subject to negotiated expenditure ceilings in recent years. This approach has contained the growth of total spending somewhat, but the staff noted that the scope for further cost reduction remains substantial. This applies, in particular, to hospitals, as the system of expenditure ceilings for individual hospitals had tended to perpetuate existing inefficiencies and overcapacity. The staff advocated the early formulation of measures to restructure the hospital sector and reform hospital financing, The main measure discussed was the gradual introduction of a reimbursement scheme for hospitals based on standardized costs. The 1/ Strictly speaking, the Maastricht criterion is a deficit of less than 3 percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - authorities stated that they intended to move in this direction in the medium term. For 1996, however, they would continue to negotiate overall spending limits. Also, salary increases in the health case sector would be kept in line with those in the rest of the public sector. On pensions, the authorities emphasized that the 1993 reform of the basic pension scheme (regime general), which inter alia increased the number of years required for receiving a full pension, would ensure balance of the scheme over the next 15 years. The main issue now was to reform the special pension schemes for public sector employees, and the supplementary pension schemes for private sector employees, the generous benefits of which have required increasing charges in order to maintain the schemes in balance. While acknowledging the scope for reform, the authorities pointed to the political difficulties involved in curtailing the privileges of powerful groups. As part of the reforms, the new government would also put more emphasis on the development of funded pension schemes. To this end, current fiscal incentives for saving would be reviewed. With respect to the special pension schemes, the staff observed that the key elements of the reform of the basic pension system should also be extended to these schemes. This would result in significant savings over the longer run. Given demographic developments, further sharp increases in contribution rates to the supplementary pension schemes would be necessary if benefits were not reduced. Indeed, such reform would also be required to permit the development of pension funds. No dramatic change was envisaged in the family branch of social security, although the authorities agreed that there was a case--albeit only a limited one in their view- -for a better targeting of expenditure and more extensive means testing. They noted that political constraints had made it difficult to reduce the generous family and housing allowances. While demographic developments have led to falling expenditures, new benefits have been introduced absorbing the incipient surplus. Thus, little help was expected from the family branch of the social security system in reducing the deficit or lowering social security charges. The staff expressed the view that, given the generosity of benefits of the family branch and the budgetary constraints, there was a pressing need to shift to a system based on more rigorous means testing. The staff strongly supported the authorities' intention to present a medium-term fiscal adjustment program with the 1996 budget. It expressed the view that, on the basis of its projection of GDP growth of about 2 3/4 percent per year, the program should provide for a reduction of the general government deficit to a range of 2-2 l/2 percent of GDP by 1997 (broadly in line with the 1993 convergence plan). Such a target would provide for a margin of safety. Given the uncertainties in the outlook and the potential for slippage both on the revenue and expenditure sides, as demonstrated by recent developments, targeting the maximum possible deficit ran the risk of not fulfilling the convergence criterion. Furthermore, an Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - objective at the borderline of what is acceptable might not reassure markets to the extent desired. The staff emphasized that fiscal consolidation was essential and that it was desirable to make this adjustment now given the favorable cyclical position. Although deficit reduction could cause a small output loss in the short run, it would not preclude a steady decline in unemployment. It would also guard against the potentially far greater effect on the growth of output and employment of the risk of failing to meet the Maastricht deficit limit. Furthermore, as discussed below, the fight against unemployment requires primarily strong structural measures. The authorities and the staff agreed that, on the basis of current policies, the general government deficit would unlikely decline to 3 percent of GDP by 1997. Additional measures would, therefore, be required to achieve adequate deficit reduction. The staff shared the authorities' view that fiscal consolidation has to emphasize expenditure reduction, given France's large spending for social purposes and the resulting high burden of taxes and especially social security charges (Table 3). However, a major redesign of the social security system, while highly desirable, will take time. In the meantime, savings will have to be achieved mainly by strengthening the various mechanisms to control expenditure already in place, wage restraint, and revenue measures. The staff presented an adjustment scenario which aims to reduce the general government deficit to 2 l/2 percent of GDP by 1997 and stabilize the debt to GDP ratio (see Annex II). The main measures of the adjustment scenario are: an 18-month freeze of public sector salaries; additional measures to restrain the growth of health care expenditure focusing on hospitals; and an increase in the CSG from 2.4 percent to 3.4 percent. The authorities also saw merit in a faster fiscal adjustment than that implied by the Maastricht deficit ceilings, but noted that no decision on a fiscal consolidation path had yet been made. With respect to the measures put forward, they said that they were contemplating similar steps, which would be announced at the time of the 1996 budget in late September. The authorities also indicated that consideration was being given to a reform of the income tax system. Table 3 shows that revenues from income taxes are comparatively low in France mainly due to a narrow tax base and generous exemptions. The main intention was to reduce exemptions, while lowering the high marginal tax rates. Larger receipts from income taxes would provide additional room to cut the relatively high social security contributions. 2. Monetary policv and the exchange rate Monetary policy has for a number of years aimed at achieving price stability. In 1994-95, the newly independent Banque de France has sought to keep the rate of inflation at no more than 2 percent. In pursuing this objective, it has adopted an external intermediate target, namely, to maintain the stability of the franc against the group of the most credible currencies within the ERM; it also has a broad intermediate target defined Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicTable 3.

The authorities emphasized the importance of the exchange rate commitment and the gains this policy has produced in terms of price stability and relatively low long-term interest rates. The authorities believed that the pressure on the franc in early 1995 had reflected tensions in international markets and pre-election uncertainties in,France; news about fiscal slippage had also been a contributing factor. They explained that the size and the timing of the increase in the repurchase rate had been intended to keep the deviation of the franc from the central rate both small and as short as possible. Following the adoption in August 1993 of the wider bands, the Banque de France would take advantage of the greater flexibility as a tactical weapon to fight speculation. It should, however, be clear to markets that a change in the central rate was excluded. The staff agreed that monetary policy should continue to be guided by a strong exchange rate commitment with use of the wider bands limited to exceptional circumstances, such as those prevailing in early 1995. Such circumstances may also require the use of interest rates as a defensive weapon, and the actions taken by the Banque de France to support the franc earlier this year had been fully 'warranted. The staff also observed that the situation in mid-1995, with the franc standing some 4-5 percent below the central rate in terms of the deutsche mark while short-term interest rates were more than 2 percentage points above those in Germany, was not a stable one. Either markets would be reassured and the franc would strengthen and interest rates would come down, or the scales could well dip in the other direction with the franc coming under renewed pressure. While the supplementary budget has had a positive effect on market confidence, the key issue now was the formulation of a credible program 'of fiscal consolidation, coupled with structural measures to promote employment growth, that would improve market confidence and allow short-term rates to decline substantially. The staff noted that if short-term interest rates were to remain at the level prevailing at the time of the discussions for an extended period, this would have adverse consequences for growth. The empirical evidence points to an impact of short-term interest rates on investment and overall activity not only through their effect on aggregate demand, but also through a change in the relative price of capital. Although the immediate impact of an increase in short-term interest rates is small, it tends to significantly dampen investment if sustained over a longer period. I/ These results reflect in part the fact that more than half of long-term loans to enterprises are at floating rates. The gove.rnment was also concerned about the effect of short-term interest rates on activity. The Banque de France, 1/ See "France - Selected Background Issues", SM/93/197 and Corr. 1. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - however, believed that short-term rates had little impact on economic activity. Nonetheless, the Banque de France agreed that decisive fiscal consolidation would contribute to a reduction in interest rates resulting in a better policy mix. The authorities noted that market sentiment had already improved, having allowed the Banque de France to reduce the repurchase rate from 8 percent to 7 l/4 percent at that time while the franc had strengthened. They expected further favorable market reactions, given the fiscal and employment measures introduced by the new government. The Banque de France would take advantage of a further improvement in market confidence to lower short-term rates, subject to preserving stability of the exchange rate. u The Banque de France rejected the view that more aggressive interest rate reduction was warranted, as this would undermine stability and would lead to higher interest rates in the longer run. The authorities and the staff agreed that external competitiveness, at an aggregate level, was not an issue at this juncture. Export growth has been robust in most cases, market shares have been maintained, and effective exchange rate developments do not indicate a large real appreciation of the franc despite' the weakness of the dollar and some European currencies. The authorities noted, however, that some exporters, mainly of agricultural products, were complaining about a lack of competitiveness vis-a-vis Italian and Spanish producers, and the bilateral trade balance with Italy has shown a significant deterioration since 1992. On European monetary union, the authorities referred to the substantial amount of technical work that was going on under the aegis of the EMI on the modalities of a common monetary policy. They also expressed satisfaction with the close monetary cooperation in the current stage II of EMU. With respect to stage III, they firmly expected it to enter into force in 1999 with France being among the first group of participants. The formal decision on stage III and the participating countries would have to be taken approximately 12 months before the effective date of stage III on January 1, 1999. Following the EU commission's green book on the passage to a common currency in stage III, the discussion on the modalities was, of course, still at an early stage, with France favoring use of the common currency in large transactions in money and foreign exchange markets from the beginning. 1/ As noted above, the Banque de France's repurchase rate was lowered to 6.15 percent by the end of August, while the franc rose to within 2 l/2 percent of the central parity in terms of the deutsche mark.

Financial Sector 25 - With the financial sector still in the process of adjusting to deregulation and growing European integration, the cyclical downturn added to the problems facing financial institutions. The recession caused a decline in asset quality, thus, necessitating sharply higher provisions and reducing profits. Loan losses accumulated especially with respect to small and medium-sized industries hit particularly hard by the recession. The situation was aggravated by an oversupply of office space, especially in the Paris region, resulting in falling real estate prices. This price collapse further aggravated the difficulties encountered by financial institutions, because much of the commercial lending was backed by real estate collateral and because real estate developers had borrowed heavily during the period of rising asset prices. In the past two years, provisioning by commercial banks has approached F 100 billion. Market estimates put total doubtful real estate loans at about F 150 billion. The authorities stressed that they closely monitored the situation and that the ongoing recovery and a reduction in short-term interest rates should bring about an improvement. The Banking Commission has also noted the importance of better internal controls. Given the experience of other countries, the staff emphasized that vigilance and better supervision were required in order to prevent a crisis and the need for large officially supported rescue operations. The government has so far provided support to a handful of institutions in which it is a shareholder. The most prominent case has been the state-owned Credit Lyonnais whose problems arose mainly from rapid lending growth both in France and abroad during the late 1980s which resulted in massive losses. The bank's difficulties began to emerge in 1991, and the authorities conducted examinations of the balance sheet of Credit Lyonnais and its subsidiaries through 1991-93. However, decisive action to correct the problems and recapitalize the bank took until early 1994. With the bank's situation remaining difficult, a second rescue operation was mounted in March 1995. L/ The authorities expect that the total support to be provided (estimated at about F 50 billion, 0.7 percent of GDP) will be largely covered by special transfers to the government of future profits. The official support provided to Credit Lyonnais has also raised competition issues. The rescue package was cleared by the European Commission in late July under the condition that Credit Lyonnais sells 35 percent of its commercial operations outside France in three years. In approving the request, the Commission also set a limit of F 45 billion on government support.

Labor market Most of France's high unemployment is concentrated among the unskilled and the young, and is the result of social policies and labor market rigidities (Chart 10). u A minimum wage, which is high by international standards and relative to the average wage and which is the same for all age groups and regions, has choked off demand for unskilled labor. Further wage rigidities are introduced by the enforced extension of collective bargaining agreements reached by a minority of workers and employers to entire sectors and regions. Increasingly generous social benefits have reduced the incentives to seek employment; for example, the ratio of minimum welfare benefits to the disposable income of a worker paid the minimum wage was about 70 percent for a bachelor and 90 percent for a couple with two children in 1994. 2/ At the same time, high non-wage labor costs have reduced the demand for labor (social insurance contributions, both of the employer and the employee, add about 60 percent to wage costs at the level of the minimum wage). In addition, a decline in the demand for unskilled labor due to rapid technological change, weaknesses in education and training, and rigid labor and product market regulations have played a role. Since the late 198Os, labor market policy has shifted from measures to cushion the social effects of unemployment to supporting employment growth. The measures introduced in recent years included: a reduction in labor costs for unskilled workers by lowering social security charges; the creation of new, and the expansion of existing, employment and training programs; a gradual reduction in unemployment benefits linked to the duration of unemployment; and measures to increase labor market flexibility, including facilitating part-time work, fixed-term contracts, and flexible working hours. a/ Some 2.3 million persons, equivalent to close to 12 percent of total employment, benefitted from employment programs in 1994. The cost of employment measures amounted to 4.1 percent of GDP in 1993, of which slightly less than half was for active measures. The new government announced in late June a number of additional measures to reduce the cost of employing unskilled workers, the young and those whose human capital is eroding because of long-term unemployment. First, a new "contrat initiative emploi" (CIE) for the employment of the long-term unemployed will exempt employers from all social security charges and provide a monthly subsidy of F 2,000 for a period of two years (the amount of the subsidy alone is equivalent to close to one-third of the gross minimum wage (SMIC) of F 6,300 per month). Second, the subsidy for hiring a L/ The factors responsible for the high unemployment listed here were investigated inter alia in a recent Fund study, "Why is Unemployment in France so High" (WP/94/58).

And third, there will be a widening to medical insurance of the partial exemption from employer contributions to social security for workers earning between 1.0 and 1.2 times the SMIC. This measure reduces labor costs for a worker earning the SMIC by 13 percent (in combination with an already existing exemption from the contribution to family allowances). I/ The authorities were counting on significant employment effects from these measures. In particular, they expected that some 350,000 jobs (gross amount including jobs under existing employment programs to be replaced by the CIE) would benefit from the CIE by the end of 1996, equivalent to 1 3/4 percent of total employment. However, they agreed that it was difficult to estimate the net effects, which could be substantially lower because of substitution (replacement of non-subsidized by subsidized workers) and windfall effects (employment would have occurred in any event). u The staff supported the recent measures, in particular, the cut in labor costs for unskilled workers. While unit labor costs at the aggregate level were not a problem, costs at the low-skill end of the labor market were too high to generate adequate demand for such labor (see the accompanying background paper). The staff noted that a case can be made for further and permanent reductions in the cost of unskilled labor, but additional increases in the already large employment subsidies would be difficult to finance. A lowering of the minimum wage of unskilled young workers was therefore a matter of priority. In this context, the staff expressed the view that the increase of 4 percent in the SMIC that was also announced in late June -- about twice the amount legally required -- was counterproductive. The authorities did not share this view, and noted that despite the increase in the SMIC the real net income of workers earning the minimum wage would remain unchanged because of the effect of the VAT increase and the elimination of a rebate paid on the CSG and the pension contribution. In addition to a minimum wage graduated by age, the staff stressed the need for broad structural reforms to reduce unemployment. Such measures should include more effective education and training, especially vocational programs. Social and unemployment benefits should also be modified to enhance work incentives by creating a more adequate differential between minimum compensation and benefits. The level and comprehensiveness of welfare benefits is a key political choice. However, it entails a trade-off 1/ This exemption is scheduled to be gradually extended to wages up to 1.5 times the SMIC by 1998. Wages between 1.5 and 1.6 times the SMIC will be subject to a 50 percent reduction.

The staff noted that the current extremely high levels of both social benefits and ,unemployment warranted a review giving special attention to this trade-off. It was also important to discontinue the enforced extension of collective bargaining agreements to whole sectors and regions in order to foster greater wage flexibility. Furthermore, a streamlining of the multitude of employment programs deserved consideration. 5. Other With respect to trade policy, the authorities indicated that three topics would dominate France's agenda in the period ahead: the integration of Eastern European countries; fostering the role of the World Trade Organization as a multilateral forum for the resolution of trade conflicts: and the liberalization of capital flows (notably foreign direct investment) and financial services (particularly in banking and insurance). On the first issue, the authorities noted that the accession by Eastern European countries to the EU would necessitate significant adjustments in EU policies. At present, imports of agricultural products by the EU from these countries were subject to quantitative restrictions, which were, however, not binding as the agricultural sector in these countries had not yet fully adapted to domestic deregulation. This situation was bound to change and the EU would have to reform its agricultural policy. Issues related to agricultural exports were also dominant in the discussions between the EU and the Maghreb countries. The staff argued for a substantial liberalization and opening to imports of the agricultural sector in the EU. Regarding the liberalization of financial services, the French authorities stressed their strong interest in the conclusion of non-discriminatory multilateral agreements. They were concerned about the lack of decisive progress at that time, and hoped that an agreement could be obtained in July (when an interim agreement was, indeed, reached). They warned that a major setback in this area would jeopardize, in particular, the liberalization of telecommunications. On the recent agreement between the United States and Japan on autos and auto parts, the authorities noted that the EU did not favor this approach. Privatization of state-owned companies in the non-monopolistic sectors has been an important policy concern in recent years. Following the parliamentary election of 1993, the new conservative majority revised the 1986 privatization law, expanding the list of companies to be privatized by 21 companies. Seven companies have been privatized since 1993, generating around F 120 billion in net receipts. The program has decelerated since mid-1994, and the budget revision in June 1995 scaled back projected net privatization receipts for the year by 45 percent to F 26 billion.
