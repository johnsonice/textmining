N-R~DUCTION 1. A mission visited CuraGao during March l- 11, 1999 to hold the 1999 Article IV consultation discussions.’ The Netherlands Antilles consists of a federation of five Caribbean islands that constitutes an autonomous but integral part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.2 It does not have a separate quota or other financial relationships with the Fund (Appendix I). The Antillean authorities have jurisdiction over all domestic matters, including monetary and fiscal policy, and issue a domestic currency, the Netherlands Antillean guilder (NA f.), which has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of NA f. 1.7895 per US$l since December 23, 1971. The acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, by the Kingdom of the Netherlands also applies to the Netherlands Antilles. 2. At the request of the Dutch and Antillean authorities, a staff-monitored adjustment program was initiated in early 1997. It was designed to address the severe fiscal crisis that had developed during the first half of the 1990s as a result of the failure to adjust to the decline in offshore profit tax revenues and to contain budgetary wage pressures. In order to facilitate program implementation and monitoring, in October 1996, a Fund staff member took up a post as resident representative in Willemstad, financed by the Dutch authorities. 3. In concluding the last Article IV consultation on March 3, 1997 (SM/97/45, 2/14/97), Directors emphasized the importance of complete and timely implementation of the adjustment program. They recommended that the general government deficit be contained to 1 percent of GDP in 1997 (excluding sinking tind contributions) and that monetary policy be tightened. They underscored the need for a comprehensive, expenditure-reducing civil service reform, a broadening of the tax base, and an improvement in cost recovery of public services. Moreover, they noted that to boost economic growth, it would be necessary to broaden structural reforms, inter alia, to improve the efficiency of the financial sector, combat money laundering, accelerate privatization, and promote labor market flexibility. 4. The program went off track almost immediately, owing to institutional weaknesses and the failure to respond adequately to unexpected revenue shortfalls. A review mission in July 1997 and discussions with the authorities in December 1997 did not succeed in reaching agreement on a revised program. Following January 1998 elections, a fragile five-party ‘The staff team comprised Messrs. Everaert (head), Lenseigne, and Martijn, with Mrs. Ann Phillips as Administrative Assistant (all EUI). Mr. Houtman, Advisor to the Executive Director, participated in some of the meetings. The mission met with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the Commissioner of Finance of the Island Government of CuraGao, the Speaker of Parliament, the President of the central bank, the Governor for the Kingdom of the Netherlands, senior officials of the central and island governments, autonomous public sector institutions, public sector enterprises, and the central bank, and representatives of commercial banks, the offshore financial and commercial sectors, and other private business. ‘The five islands are: Curaqao and Bonaire (the Leeward Islands), and Saba, St. Eustatius, and the southern part of St. Maarten (the Windward Islands). In addition to the Netherlands Antilles’ central government, each island has a separate, autonomous government.

Policy formulation and implementation remained at a prolonged standstill, and, since late 1998, has been influenced by the April-May 1999 island government elections. The outcome of the election for the island government of Curagao, which is currently run by parties that are in opposition at the central level, could significantly alter the course of policy implementation. In this context, a request for a resumption of staff monitoring later in 1999 cannot be ruled out. 5. The Netherlands Antilles’ statistical base has improved significantly in recent years, in part owing to Fund technical assistance, but deficiencies in the availability, quality, and timeliness of data continue to hamper effective surveillance (Appendix II).3 II. BACKGROUND 6. Since the mid-1990s, the Antillean economy has been performing significantly below its potential, lagging behind trade partners and other Caribbean economies (Figure 1 and Table 1). With the domestic resource base limited, and the economy dependent on a few key sectors-tourism, transshipment, oil refining, and offshore finance-economic developments have proven to be vulnerable to several adverse shocks which occurred in the recent past: a continuing decline in the offshore financial sector,4 disruptions to tourism owing to hurricanes, and a steady reduction in the workforce of the oil refinery. These shocks exposed the lack of flexibility of labor and product markets to adjust to competitive pressures. Moreover, the adjustment process has also been severely hampered by the government’s failure to tackle large fiscal imbalances and its recourse to arrears, which have dampened confidence, investment, and economic activity. As a result, real GDP is estimated to have contracted during 1996-97, and to have grown only modestly in 1998.’ 7. The fixed exchange rate regime has kept inflation low, but recent wage increases have adversely affected external competitiveness and contributed to declining employment. Except for a brief episode of inflationary pressure in late 1996 and early 1997, owing to a lapse in monetary control, consumer price inflation has generally remained below that of the peg currency country. It slowed to 1.2 percent in 1998, in response to monetary tightening and falling import prices, and is expected to remain low in 1999. Since 1995, the real effective exchange rate (based on relative consumer prices) has appreciated moderately, and economy-wide wages have risen significantly (Figures 2 and 3). While overall exports (excluding the offshore sector) have resumed growth, the impact of higher wage costs has led 3T~o Fund (STA) technical assistance missions took place in 1997 on monetary and balance of payments statistics, respectively. 4Tightening of tax legislation abroad has contributed to a fall in offshore profit tax revenue from 5.3 percent of GDP in 1993 to 2.7 percent of GDP in 1998. ‘Final national accounts are available through 1995, but no price deflators exist other than the consumer price index. Staff estimates of real GDP growth after 1995 are the average of independent estimates by the central bank and the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).

Consequently, unemployment reached 16.7 percent of the labor force in Curaqao, continuing a rising trend which began in 1995 and has been affecting the female and young segments of the labor force more than proportionally, indicating underlying labor market rigidities. 6 8. After contracting in 1996, money demand increased moderately during 1997-98, while domestic credit stagnated, thus allowing a significant buildup of net foreign assets in the banking system (Figure 4 and Table 2). Despite weak economic activity, financial savings in the form of time deposits by institutional investors and enterprises grew in 1997-98, reflecting economic uncertainty, and wariness of making investments in government securities. Domestic credit growth slowed, owing to the weak demand by creditworthy borrowers and the reluctance to lend by banks. With high yields on government bonds as a result of unsustainable fiscal imbalances and limited competition in the banking sector, real interest rates and intermediation spreads remained high (Figure 5).7 The buildup of net foreign assets also stemmed from the disbursement of project aid by the Netherlands in late 1998, which was deposited temporarily at the central bank (Bank van de Nederlandse Antillen, BNA), and the removal of the maximum limit on the net foreign asset position of commercial banks. * 9. The overall balance of payments returned to a small surplus during 1997-98, as capital account surpluses continued while the current account deficit declined, permitting a buildup in offkial reserves to about two months of merchandise imports by end-1998 (Figure 6 and Table 3). Weak economic activity checked imports, while merchandise exports, tourism, and investment income inflows recovered. These developments dominated the continuing decline in offshore sector receipts and higher net private remittance outflows. Lower net private capital inflows-owing to decreasing investment-and larger portfolio outflows were partially compensated for by larger disbursements of project aid, which rose above their historical average in 1998. Since 1996, no amortization payments have been made on debt owed to the Netherlands. 6 Labor market developments are described in the background paper. 7Reported intermediation spreads tend to be overstated, since publicly announced prime lending rates are higher than what commercial banks charge to prime borrowers. The decline in the government bond yield in 1998 shown in Figure 5 is artificial (see footnote 12). * Until August 1998, the maximum limit on the so-called B-9 position of a commercial bank forced banks to dispose of any foreign assets above this maximum. The removal of the maximum permitted the banks to invest profits and dividend income abroad, thus raising their net foreign asset position. The restriction that the net foreign asset position cannot be negative has remained in effect.

The structural adjustment program initiated in 1996 to correct fiscal imbalances and restore economic growth, and endorsed by the staff in early 1997, was not implemented as envisaged (Box 1)’ The program was to reduce the general government deficit to a level that could be financed without incurring arrears and to remedy the structural weaknesses of the budget. In the event, the program went off track almost immediately and financial assistance from the Netherlands was withheld. lo Lack of confidence boosted yields on government securities, thus raising interest expenditure, and contributing to the significant Box 1. Netherlands Antilles: 1996-97 Structural Adjustment Program Targets and Outcomes Implementation of the adjustment program was partial and suffered from delays. While significant measures were taken (e.g., introduction of a sales tax in the Leeward Islands, a turnover tax in the Windward Islands, and a self-assessment “pay-as-you-file” system for profit taxes), the rapid decline in tax revenues could not be reversed. In 1997, expenditure on wages and salaries exceeded program targets, despite a proclaimed wage and hiring freeze, owing to increased use of overtime and wage drift associated with a job regrading exercise. Loopholes in monetary controls led to excessive credit growth in 1996, but additional nomnarket restrictions, imposed on Janw 1, 1997, restored control. 1996 1997 Target Actual Target Actual Nominal GDP (percent change) Consumer prices (percent change, period) Net domestic assets (percent change) Private sector credit (percent change) Genera1 government balance (percent of GDP)l/ Tax revenues (percent of GDP) Noninterest expenditure (percent of GDP) Current account (percent of GDP)2/ Net offkial reserves, excluding gold (in months of merchandise imports) 0.7 1.8 4.0 1.4 2.7 3.4 3.0 3.1 3.8 6.8 1.8 0.3 3.9 6.8 3.9 -0.6 -3.1 -3.9 -2.0 -4.2 28.9 25.1 27.1 25.5 34.5 30.7 29.2 28.9 0.5 -5.8 -2.4 -3.8 1.8 1.5 1.8 1.9 Source: Data provided by the authori ties.

Moreover, reflecting an increasingly binding financing constraint, arrears to the pension fund continued to accrue, and expenditure on goods and services and transfers was compressed. 11. Fiscal policy remained adrift during 1998 as the newly elected central government struggled to formulate and implement a coherent package of economic policies. Budget execution followed a similar pattern as in 1997, with the tax revenue-to- GDP ratio decreasing, arrears accumulating, and higher interest payments and transfers compressing other expenditures. The reported decline in the general government deficit by about 0.7 percentage point of GDP in 1998 was mostly due to an exceptional repayment of net lending (Figure 7 and Table 4). In September 1998, the authorities announced a medium- term Economic Recovery Plan (1999-2002) (ERP), aimed at boosting investment and economic growth, which was to raise fiscal revenues and help resolve budgetary imbalances without drastic expenditure cuts. To this end, tax incentives and government guarantees were to be granted, and public investment raised. Income and profit taxes were to be lowered, while further streamlining of the public sector was to reduce expenditures. 12. The Economic Recovery Plan failed to inspire confidence, in part because it was not accompanied by a quantified budget, and not coordinated between the central and island governments. The implications of the ERP for the 1999 budget have not yet been quantified in a comprehensive manner, owing to delays in specifying the nature and timing of several measures embedded in the plan. Meanwhile, the 1999 budget-adopted prior to the completion of the ERP in the fall of 1998-has been rendered obsolete by the partial implementation of the ERP. Moreover, the ERP has been sharply criticized by the island government of Curagao for its adverse impact on the budget deficit of the island, which was attempting to continue a policy of fiscal restraint. l1 13. With excessive budget deficits continuing, monetary policy has been carrying the burden of preserving the fixed exchange rate system-so far with success-while steps have been taken toward increased reliance on indirect instruments of monetary control. To manage this burden, the BNA has been enforcing a strict policy of keeping bank credit to the government at below its October 1996 level, and using tight monetary and capital controls to contain credit expansion to other sectors. The latter was facilitated by weak demand for credit and cautious lending behavior by banks during 1997-98. In preparation for the removal of the ceiling on private sector credit-which was effected on January 1, 19997 the BNA raised the minimum reserve requirement, in successive steps to 8 percent during 1998. To mitigate the adverse effect on already high intermediation spreads and help develop an interbank money market, from August 1998, the BNA permitted banks to hold 25 percent of the reserve requirement in the form of BNA certificates of deposit. At the same time, the maximum limit on the net foreign asset position (B-9 position) was abolished. “The budget of the island of Curaqao is slightly larger than that of the central government, but the central government mostly defines overall tax policy, thus leaving the island government with control over only minor tax issues (such as excises) and expenditure.

For the moment, the adverse economic impact of the fiscal imbalances has been reflected mainly in a buildup in arrears, which has been depleting the resources of the pension system and undermining good governance. The civil servants’ pension fund (Ambtenaren Pensionfonds van de Nederlandse Antillen, APNA) has significant outstanding claims on the government, and has been forced to cover the losses of an extrabudgetary fund. Its assets have been invested excessively in claims on the central and island governments, at times at below-market interest rates. l2 In anticipation of the aging of the Antillean population and the accompanying increase in pay-as-you-go payments, a sinking fund was established in 1997, but to date no contributions have been made. Various disputed claims are outstanding among different levels of government, autonomous public sector entities, and public enterprises, undermining financial discipline. 15. Partial progress has nonetheless been made in tackling some structural weaknesses of the budget. Budget monitoring and tax administration have been strengthened considerably since the mid-l 990s. With the introduction of the sales and turnover taxes in 1996-97, the tax structure has been shifted away from excessive reliance on direct taxation, but the share of direct tax revenue in total revenues remains comparatively high by international standards, as do marginal income and profit tax rates (Box 2). As a result of the partial implementation of the recommendations of the Core Task Analysis, non- core activities of the government are being divested (e.g., post offrce, refuse collection), and the size of the civil service is being reduced. Even so, public sector employment and wages still exceed relevant international comparators. III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 16. The discussions focused on ways to avoid an impending fiscal crisis and policies to restore economic growth. The ERP’s strategy to stimulate the economy and its wavering implementation appeared to be causing a further erosion of confidence, and risked triggering a serious financial crisis later in 1999. As a result, the central government was beginning to contemplate the need for a shift toward a fiscally orthodox adjustment program, an approach favored by the island government of Curacao, but fostering consensus for this shift was seen as an uphill task. Meanwhile, monetary controls would be kept firmly in place to prevent the fiscal crisis from threatening the fixed exchange rate system. To restore growth, the authorities saw the need for fiscal adjustment along a gradual path, combined with steady progress in resolving key structural problems. For this, and to deal with the perceived adjustment costs, they expected significant support from the Netherlands, which would require an urgent normalization of financial relations. 12By mid- 1998, half of APNA assets-equivalent to 24 percent of GDP-was invested in claims on the government, and in September 1998, the island government of Curacao persuaded APNA to refinance its outstanding debt (excluding the stock of arrears) at an interest’rate of 6.5 percent, down from 8.5 percent and below market yields on bond issues.

A. Macroeconomic Policies for 1999 17. The authorities recognized that the fiscal strategy adopted in late 1998, but only partially implemented, appeared to be failing to restore confidence and that further implementation of the Economic Recovery Plan would need to be reconsidered.13 They agreed with the staffs view that domestic investors had reacted negatively to the plan, which lacked specificity in several areas and did not spell out how the f%ther widening of the deficit would be financed. Confidence had been fLrther dented by the delay in implementing the turnover tax, which became effective only in March 1999 (while the sales tax that it replaced had already been abolished in January 1999), and also by the fact that other proposed tax reforms, especially income and profit tax cuts, were stuck in parliamentary 13The term ‘authorities’ is used mostly interchangeably with ‘central government’ in the remainder of this report, but also covers the island government of Curaqao if it shares the same view. Where differences matter, the distinction between government levels is made explicit Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-21- committee. At the same time, little progress had been made with expenditure-reducing measures. The authorities ascribed much of the delay to the complexities of the legal process and the time needed to build consensus for these measures. 18. The staffs assessment that the budget-without adjustment measures-could well experience serious cash-flow problems in 1999 was not disputed by the island government of Curaqao, but the central government was more sanguine about financing prospects. In part, the central government’s view stemmed from the absence of difficulties in financing the 1998 budget deficit and APNA’s willingness to invest fi&her in central government securities. The impact of present policies on the budget had not been quantified in a consistent framework, however, and there was no official projection of the likely deficit outcome. Against this background, there was no substantial dispute of the staffs projection that, without measures, the budget deficit was likely to double to 5.1 percent of GDP (Table 4). This would stem from a decline in tax revenues associated with the delay in adopting the turnover tax on the Leeward Islands, a drop in repayment of net lending, and an increase in interest expenditure. Moreover, government guarantees related to a large investment project had been called in, requiring a cash payment of about 1 percent of GDP. In addition, the lapse of the wage and entitlement freeze for civil servants would prevent adequate progress in reducing the wage bill. The staff estimated that the budget was likely to run into a binding cash constraint before too long, even with full deferral of pension contributions and refinancing of domestic amortization falling due. The latter was by no means guaranteed, though, as domestic investors were becoming increasingly concerned about their exposure to the public sector. 19. The discussion of policy measures to stave off the risk of a full-blown fiscal crisis focused on the turnover tax and the wage bill, but the authorities were not in a position to commit to specific measures. The authorities indicated that policy initiatives currently underway, such as the reduction in the income tax, were likely to be put on hold. They saw merit in imposing a uniform and higher turnover tax rate, which the staff emphasized would provide an immediate boost to revenues and reduce the potential revenue loss during the start-up phase of this new tax. The staffs suggestions-to restore the wage and entitlement freeze, and to reduce wages through outright cuts, specific taxes, or a shiR in pension contributions to the employee-met with considerable opposition, especially Corn the central government. The authorities felt that continuing the wage freeze, which had lasted for nearly three years, and implementing other across-the-board reductions in take-home pay would be socially unacceptable and would aggravate the public sector’s difficulty in retaining and attracting highly qualified staff. However, they admitted that the civil service remained overstaffed and &rther layoffs would be needed, and that wages at the low-skilled end were high compared with the private sector. The stti strongly argued for a firther reduction of the size of the civil service and cautioned against the extension of overly generous layoff benefits that had delayed fiscal adjustment in the past. 20. The authorities hoped that, following the island government elections, consensus would be achieved on an adjustment program, including immediate measures to reduce the deficit and agreement on external financing. A committee of independent advisors had Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - been appointed to evaluate current economic policies at both the central and the island government levels, and to propose alternatives, as needed, to impart credibility to the adjustment effort. Its report was expected to be ready immediately after the elections.14 Similarly, an ad hoc committee had been established to take stock of the outstanding disputed claims between the island and central government and propose a resolution. Moreover, it was clear that reestablishment of good working relationships with the Dutch authorities was needed, not just for financing the program but also for continuing the involvement of much- needed foreign advisors. The authorities hoped that this approach would be instrumental in addressing institutional weaknesses and avoiding policy conflicts between the central and island governments, which had hampered efforts to formulate and implement a credible economic program. 21. The authorities remained committed to ensuring the viability of the current peg to the U.S. dollar, which continued to provide stability and was seen to be suffkiently competitive. The BNA was confident that the ceiling on credit to the public sector would be adhered to and that it would be able to prevent any undue acceleration of private sector credit growth so as to avoid pressure on the peg. The staff accepted the continuation of the credit ceiling as a necessary, transitory compromise, but cautioned against the risk that it could be circumvented. While supporting the maintenance of the current level of the peg, the staff noted that high labor costs, in part owing to the recent reduction in the workweek and labor market rigidities, were adversely affecting the external competitiveness of the key stay-over tourism sector-a view confirmed by the business sector.” The authorities were less concerned, noting that cruise tourism was booming, and that the hotel and restaurant sector had been exempted from the new law. They gave more weight to the lack of airlift and image problems in the Netherlands as causes for the poor performance of stay-over tourism. The staff and authorities agreed that pegging to the U.S. dollar remained appropriate, given the limited trade with countries outside the Western Hemisphere.16 22. The experience with the increased reliance on the minimum reserve requirement in the conduct of monetary policy had been favorable, but some excess liquidity appeared to persist, and the authorities would consider further refinements of this instrument. While weak credit growth could be a partial explanation for excess liquidity, the authorities acknowledged the staffs conjecture that the absence of daily reserve averaging, and the explicit policy of setting the minimum reserve requirement only for one month at a time, raised uncertainty for banks, compelling them to hold precautionary balances. The 14At his request, the mission provided the president of the central bank, who chairs the committee, with its quantitative analysis of the budget, including medium-term scenarios. “In late 1998, the workweek was reduced to 40 hours, with mandatory double pay on Sundays. This was likely to raise labor costs as more than 20 percent of the employed were reportedly working in excess of 40 hours per week, and many enterprises other than hotels and restaurants are operating on Sundays. The latter in turn reflected structural rigidities, inter alia, legal restrictions on the use of temporary workers. 16Trade, including tourism, with the Netherlands, the only relevant trade partner in Europe, amounts to about 13.5 percent of total trade. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - central bank would consider modifying the reserve requirement policy to address this issue, and would eliminate any remaining excess liquidity. The staff also cautioned the authorities about the time lag of the effect of changes in the reserve requirement, and encouraged the BNA to make more active use of market-based instruments. To ensure the effectiveness of such instruments, IQrther deepening of financial markets and increased competition in the banking system would be needed. At present, the one, dominating universal bank clearly exerted market leadership, making it difficult to obtain meaningful interest rate signals. ’ The staff acknowledged this, but argued that removal of remaining distortionary controls would in fact remedy some of the constraints on the effective use of market-based instruments. B. Medium-Term Economic Outlook and Fiscal Strategy 23. The authorities agreed that restoration of confidence would be key to improving the economic outlook and bringing out the potential of the Antillean economy. Several investment projects, especially in the tourism sector, were poised to benefit from the good physical and legal infrastructure, the relatively skilled labor force, and the political stability of the Netherlands Antilles, compared with other parts of the region. However, uncertainty about economic policies had delayed implementation of these projects, and induced some businesses to scale back operations. Thus, until this uncertainty was removed, economic prospects would remain bleak. For 1999, the authorities expected barely positive growth, based on increased capacity utilization in the tourism sector and an important investment project of the oil refinery. They concurred, nonetheless, that with appropriate policies, economic growth could pick up rapidly, driven mainly by the tourism and offshore finance sectors, although the latter would be less important for the generation of employment. 24. The authorities believed that a fiscal strategy to restore economic growth should comprise a gradual reduction of the deficit, the provision of tax relief and incentives, the creation of an efficient civil service, and reform of the pension and health care systems. They felt that a rapid pace of fiscal adjustment, like the one envisaged in the 1997 program, which targeted the objective of a balanced budget within a three-year horizon, would not be feasible. They argued for a gradual reduction of the deficit to about 2 percent of GDP by 2002. This would be brought about mainly through expenditure savings as the result of a continuation of the streamlining of the civil service, the divestiture of noncore activities, and reforms of the pension and health care systems. With the perceived need to provide tax relief to attract investment and incentives for the development of specific sectors and projects, though, not all of the savings could be used for deficit reduction. Moreover, there was an urgent need for investment in infrastructure and reform of the education system, and for a sound social policy to accompany the reforms, which would put undue pressure on the budget, unless external donor assistance was forthcoming. 25. The staff argued for a more ambitious pace of fiscal adjustment, based on realistic assumptions about available financing, and consistent with containing the “The largest bank holds over 55 percent of banking system assets Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - public debt burden, and supported its assessment with quantified scenarios (Appendix III).‘” On current policies, it was clear that the deficit could not be financed, which would lead to a further erosion of the capital base of the pension system and an unmanageable debt burden. Nevertheless, with a feasible package of adjustment measures, the deficit could be lowered to 2 percent of GDP by 2000, and reduced to 1 percent of GDP by 2002. Even though this would halt the rising debt burden by 2000, sizable external financing would be needed for the budget in order to leave adequate room for private sector investment, This scenario would allow full payment of pension contributions, including into the sinking fimd, and higher spending on infrastructure. 26. The extent to which the high marginal tax rates could be reduced would depend on the success of continuing efforts to broaden the tax base and phase out distortions. The authorities noted that progress in strengthening the administration was continuing, in particular with the imminent linking of the databases for the turnover and wage taxes. Most of the backlog on profit taxes had been cleared as a result of the pay-as-you-file system introduced in 1996, but further progress was required on income taxes. The shift toward increased reliance on indirect taxation would continue, inter alia, through the reduction of high marginal income and profit taxes, which would support employment and investment. The staff supported this approach but noted that considerable distortions remained, and suggested that for indirect taxation, a more efficient tax such as the value-added tax could be introduced in the long run, while for direct taxes, important loopholes and exemptions should be phased out. Tax incentives would need to be used sparingly, if at all, since their effectiveness was doubtful, and they introduced additional distortions and fostered rent- seeking. 27. A sustained improvement in the fiscal position would not be feasible without effective containment of expenditures, including personnel costs. The authorities remained committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the Core Task Analysis, which would lead to the establishment of an efficient and lean civil service. In this context, they would consider further substantial layoffs and adjustments to the pay structure, provided an adequate social safety net was put in place. The staff noted that for this approach to be effective in reducing expenditure, generous layoff benefits would need to be cut back and wage drift avoided. In addition, the divestiture of noncore activities would need to be accompanied by the imposition of financial discipline on the newly created autonomous entities, to prevent subsidies from becoming entrenched, and avoid the buildup of contingent liabilities. The stock of these liabilities was already significant, and the fact that some of “Given the deficiencies of the statistical base and uncertainty about the magnitude of outstanding disputed claims and contingent liabilities affecting the general government, quantification of scenarios is subject to a considerable margin of error and should be treated with caution. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - them had materialized called into question the value of continuing a policy of liberal extension of guarantees, as envisaged by the authorities.‘g 28. The authorities judged that the civil servants’ pension system remained broadly sound, but concurred that it could not continue to be used as the main source of financing of the budget deficit. The recent increase of the retirement age and record returns on overseas investments had persuaded APNA to reduce the pension contributions from the budget, even though no complete analysis had been made of the actuarial position of the fund. Moreover, the staff argued, in the absence of contributions to the sinking fund for the increased pay-as-you-go component, the resulting expenditure savings were a mere illusion. The authorities agreed that pension benefits (and contributions) could be reduced to bring them into line with private sector practice, and to remove anomalies under which some workers retire with a replacement ratio of more than 100 percent. The staff suggested that the retirement age be increased further and that early retirement entitlements be phased out. It also urged the authorities to reduce the share of assets of the fund invested in government securities, after converting outstanding arrears into securities at market-based interest rates. 29. The central government expected that the proposed centralization of health care provision would lead to cost savings, but there was still concern about its effectiveness and desirability. Under the proposal, the Social Insurance Fund (SVB )-which currently provides basic health care to about half of the population -would absorb other, specialized, public health care providers, and take on the responsibility for a mandatory universal basic health care scheme. Several concerned parties doubted that the new scheme-to be funded through a broadening of the contribution base--would achieve these objectives without creating an additional burden on the working population. The staff stressed, therefore, the need to clarify this aspect of the scheme before pressing ahead with its implementation. C. Structural Issues 30. The authorities accepted the need for labor market reforms to boost the competitiveness of the economy. They indicated that the availability of attractive labor conditions and a relatively generous social safety net in the Netherlands gave rise to unrealistic demands for wages and social benefits, which the authorities could not match.20 They were concerned about the social and income distributional consequences of high, persistent unemployment among the low-skilled, which would need to be addressed through costly educational reforms.21 The staff, taking note of these concerns, pointed to the lgExcluding the guarantees that have been called in during 1999, outstanding guarantees amount to 3.3 percent of GDP. There are other contingent liabilities as well. 2o There is no unemployment compensation in the Netherlands Antilles, and welfare benefits are relatively low, at about 12 percent of the average monthly wage for a single person. 21 In part because of a dichotomous labor market, which includes a high-skilled segment, mostly employed in banking and finance, the income share of the highest quintile is 12.6 times that of the lowest quintile. In the Netherlands this ratio is 5.5, which is very low by international comparison (e.g., it is 8.6 in the United Kingdom). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - increased use of illegal immigrants as a sign of an overly rigid formal labor market, and argued that much could be done to improve the functioning of the domestic labor market. More flexibility could be introduced in the dismissal law and the regulations governing part- time contracts and the duration of the workweek. Public sector wage restraint would provide an appropriate signal. The minimum wage could be lowered, especially for the young, and the high tax and social security wedge on labor income could be reduced, as fiscal consolidation permitted. 31. Overall, the authorities were satisfied with the quality of banking supervision and the health of the banking system, and upbeat on the prospects of the offshore financial sector. Weak economic activity during the past few years had led to an increase in nonperforming loans, but at 4.3 percent of assets, their level was not seen as posing a threat to the soundness of the banking sector (Appendix IV). Noting that confidence in banks was already strong, the banking community saw little merit in the adoption of a deposit insurance system-which was being considered. Banking supervision in its present form appeared to be adequate to protect depositors. It had also contributed to the prevention of money laundering through its role in implementing the legislation on the reporting of unusual transactions, and had devoted special attention in preparing the financial sector for the YZK issue. The authorities were also actively promoting the recovery and integrity of the offshore financial sector, mainly through the development of new products and negotiations on a new fiscal framework with the Netherlands, which would allow the Netherlands Antilles to shed its tax haven status. The staff supported the authorities’ strategy, emphasizing the need to improve continuously the operation of banking supervision, promote competition in the financial sector to raise efficiency and lower intermediation spreads, and combat money laundering. 32. The staff noted that trade liberalization had stalled, while concurring with the authorities that recent changes in the EU trade regime would not significantly affect the Antillean economy, given that only 4 percent of manufacturing exports were destined for Europe. The authorities indicated that, following the reduction of import duties by 1 percentage point in 1997, pressures on the budget had forced them to postpone the envisaged reduction (by 2 percentage points) for 1998. They noted that their trade regime had always been relatively open, though, with no quantitative restrictions, and zero rates on most foodstuffs. Moreover, the budget was much less dependent on trade taxes than in most other Caribbean nations, and a proposal to phase out the market protection regime-which selectively protects local producers- was under consideration. The staff indicated that faster progress should be considered, pointing to prohibitively high maximum tariffs-up to 100 percent-whose reduction was unlikely to have adverse consequences on budgetary revenues, but would greatly benefit consumers and improve resource allocation. 33. Progress had continued toward privatization, and the improvement of the performance of public enterprises, but views differed on the nature and speed of reform. Consequently, the key issue of whether to retain residual control rights in the public sector, especially for utilities, had remained unresolved, and current management of several public enterprises had created a consortium to bargain with the authorities on this issue. Nevertheless, some projects, such as the merger of the international and local Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - telecommunications firms to improve their marketability, and the privatization of the dry dock, were nearly complete. The staff urged the authorities to press ahead with the divestiture of all commercial public enterprises and the elaboration of an appropriate regulatory framework for the utilities. Further efficiency improvements were expected from the recent merger of the water and electricity distribution and production companies, and an electricity generation project shared between the public and private sector. Meanwhile, the main pollution problem was being addressed through the rehabilitation of the refinery. The staff welcomed these developments, but noted that problems of several other public enterprises needed to be addressed urgently, in particular those of the national airline, which appeared insolvent and likely to become an additional burden on the budget. 34. The authorities noted that the statistical base for economic analysis and policymaking had been upgraded significantly and remained committed to further improvements, even though resource constraints were forcing them to be selective in addressing deficiencies. They intended to participate in the General Data Dissemination System as a framework for systematic statistical improvements. Data on budget implementation had become available in a timely and relatively comprehensive manner, and was consistent with monetary accounts, although data on the broader public sector remained fragmented. Most of the recommendations of the 1997 Fund technical assistance mission on monetary statistics had been implemented, but on balance of payments statistics, implementation had only begun in earnest in early 1999. While final national accounts are currently only available through 1995, the Central Bureau of Statistics had begun publishing preliminary production accounts, and estimates and projections of real GDP, through 1998. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 35. Failure to address unsustainable fiscal imbalances and key structural problems, including labor market rigidities, has been eroding confidence and contributing to the poor economic performance of the Netherlands Antilles since the mid-1990s. With budget deficits persistently in excess of available financing, adjustment to the adverse external shocks, which occurred during the past decade, has become protracted. So far, monetization of the deficit has been avoided through strict monetary controls, thus safeguarding the fixed exchange rate system, and preserving macroeconomic stability and low inflation. Nevertheless, the ensuing accumulation of budgetary arrears has been jeopardizing good governance, depleting the pension fund, and straining relations with the Netherlands, the main external creditor and provider of much-needed technical advisors. 36. The current, faltering attempt to stimulate the economy though fiscal incentives will need to be replaced by a decisive implementation of deficit-reducing measures to avoid the risk of a full-blown financial crisis. On current policies, fiscal imbalances are projected to widen rapidly during the remainder of 1999 and continue to exceed available voluntary financing, even under optimistic assumptions. Fiscal adjustment should, therefore, no longer be postponed. It could be initiated through the immediate imposition of a higher, uniform turnover tax rate, and followed by measures to cut expenditures, especially on the wage bill and subsidies, while a comprehensive adjustment program is being worked out. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - 37. Restoring confidence and favorable prospects for economic growth will require considerable and sustained fiscal adjustment and significant progress in structural reforms. Building on past efforts, improvements in expenditure monitoring and tax administration, and the measures taken to resolve the fiscal crisis, the authorities should initiate a fiscal consolidation program to bring the budget deficit in line with available financing by end- 1999. The elements of such a program are well known, but previous implementation efforts have failed for lack of perseverance, the extension of overly generous transitory benefits, and the absence of a firewall between the budget and the pension fund, which has been used to cover financing shortfalls. Thus the next effort will need to include a reduction of the deficit that is front loaded, inter alia, to halt the rapidly rising public debt burden and avoid accumulation of new arrears, and sustained over time, to rebuild the capital base of the pension system. Accompanying structural reforms should focus on raising the efficiency of the public sector and the competitiveness of the Antillean economy. 38. To impart credibility to an adjustment program, it will be necessary to ensure adequate coordination of policies between different levels of government, settle outstanding disputed claims and arrears, and normalize relations with the Netherlands. The establishment of a national committee for the adjustment program is a welcome first step, but it will need to be followed up by more explicit arrangements to harmonize policy implementation among public sector entities. A clear delineation of the responsibilities of the respective entities would increase the effectiveness of policies and assist in the streamlining of the public sector. 39. The success of the adjustment effort will depend on progress in addressing the structural weaknesses of the budget. On the revenue side, the shift toward indirect taxation and the strengthening of direct tax collection need to be pursued. They should be supported by a broadening of the tax base, and a phasing out of excessive use of tax incentives. On the expenditure side, past reforms must be consolidated so that the benefits can be reaped Corn the reduction in civil service employment and the spinning off of noncore activities. Reinvigoration of these reforms, adjustments in the pay scale, and strict imposition of financial discipline on newly autonomous public entities should allow for a steady reduction in public expenditure, especially in wages and subsidies, 40. Until fiscal consolidation takes hold, monetary policy will need to carry the burden of safeguarding the current peg to the U.S. dollar, which continues to be appropriate, but the deterioration in competitiveness needs to be reversed through labor cost containment. In the present circumstances, the retention of the ceiling on credit to the government is an appropriate compromise to avoid any risk of monetization of the budget deficit. The authorities are aware of the need to eliminate any remaining excess liquidity on market-based terms, and to pursue vigorously the strategy to develop market-based instruments, as it will foster financial deepening and competition in domestic financial markets. Wage restraint in the public sector and structural reforms in labor and product markets are crucial to reduce labor costs and restore the competitiveness of the key stay-over tourism sector.

To ensure fiscal sustainability, the actuarial soundness of the pension system needs to be secured and the cost of health care reforms contained. Following conversion of outstanding arrears into marketable securities, no further arrears to the pension fund or sinking fund should be tolerated, and the share of pension fund assets invested in government securities should be lowered. Restoring actuarial soundness of the pension fund could be achieved by an effective and additional increase in the retirement age, and a reduction in the replacement ratio in line with private sector practice. Care should be exercised in implementing health care reforms, to ensure their financial viability and avoid further increases in the tax wedge on labor income from a rise in health care premiums. 42. Labor market reforms, sound development of the financial sector, restructuring of the enterprise sector, and trade liberalization are essential to improve the outlook for employment and economic growth. A comprehensive overhaul of labor laws and regulations is required to promote labor market flexibility, and should be supported by a reduction in the tax wedge on labor income, and educational reforms. The banking system appears to be sound, but supervision needs to remain vigilant to ensure adequate provisioning, while market discipline on banks is strengthened further to bring about a narrowing of intermediation spreads. The commendable ongoing efforts should be sustained to combat money laundering and promote the development of the offshore sector. An acceleration of progress in privatization and tackling the inefficiencies in utilities is necessary to lower operating costs and thus strengthen the competitiveness of the main export sectors of the economy. While the trade regime is relatively liberal, the market protection regime should be phased out, beginning with a reduction in very high tariffs. 43. The statistical base of the Netherlands Antilles needs to be improved further to resolve the deficiencies that hamper effective surveillance and policy design. Priority should be given to upgrading the balance of payments statistics, expanding the scope of public sector data, and ensuring timely and adequate coverage of data on national accounts, wages, and labor market statistics. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to participate in the General Data Dissemination System. 44. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation discussions be held within 24 months.

The Netherlands Antilles is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and does not have a separate quota, or other financial relationships with the Fund. Since January 1, 1986, when Aruba split from the Netherlands Antilles, the Kingdom of the Netherlands consists of the Netherlands itself, the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruba. The Kingdom of the Netherlands is an original member of the Fund. On February 15, 1961, the Kingdom formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Fund Agreement for all its territories. The initial par value of the Netherlands Antillean guilder-NA f. 1.88585 = US$l-was established with the Fund on December 18, 1946. The authorities communicated to the Fund a rate ofNA f. 1.79 per US$l to take effect as a central rate on December 23, 1971. Since then, the Netherlands Antillean guilder has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at this rate. 2. The Fund’s Statistics Department provided technical assistance on balance of payments statistics and on money and banking statistics in October 1997 and December 1997, respectively. 3. The Executive Board conducted the last Article IV consultation discussions for the Netherlands Antilles on March 3, 1997 (EBM/97/19) on the basis of staff report SM/97/45 (2/14/97) and recent economic developments paper W/97/46 (2/14/97).

While significant improvements have been made during the past two years, data problems continue to hamper effective surveillance of the economy of the Netherlands Antilles. Most data are published with considerable lags, and are often subject to measurement errors and large revisions. The frequency and timeliness of data availability of the core statistical indicators are shown in the attached table. A new quarterly publication of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), .initiated in 1996, has significantly improved the publicity of the research conducted by CBS. 2. Final national accounts are available until 1995 at current prices, and very preliminary national accounts from the production side are available through 1997. Since no deflators are calculated, it is difftcult to assess real growth of the economy. Recently, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) has begun to publish estimates of real GDP growth and projections for the current year on the basis of selected indicators of production and trade. The usefulness of these estimates remains limited, though, given the insufficient quality of the underlying data, which requires large judgmental adjustments. Private sector employment figures are based on annual surveys of the labor market and subject to large revisions, while for government employment several, inconsistent series are available. 3. The national consumer price index is generally adequate and published with a lag of two months by the Central Bureau of Statistics, while the separate consumer price indices for each of the three main islands are reported by the BNA, in its Quarterly Bulletin, with a lag of about six months. A consistent time series on wages is available in a timely manner only for minimum wages and wages in public enterprises, while economy-wide wage data are available for Curacao only, but with a considerable time lag. Although data are available for the aggregate wage bill of the various levels of government, uncertainty surrounding the actual number of civil servants makes it very difficult to infer average wage developments. 4. Significant steps were taken by the central government and island government of Curacao in 1996 and 1997 to improve expenditure monitoring and reporting of data on public finances. As a result, expenditures are now no longer only registered in the year that they were appropriated, but also in the year that they took place, and data on the cash budget execution is publicly available, with some lag. Since the departure of the Fund’s resident representative, the lag with which the Island Government of Curacao’s monthly accounts become available has increased somewhat, to about three months. To obtain a fully consolidated picture of the public sector, the coverage of data reporting needs to be extended to the other islands and several autonomous public institutions. Disagreement between the various government bodies concerning their mutual financial obligations has led to inconsistent reporting. 5. Monetary and financial statistics are published in the BNA’s Quarterly Bulletin with a lag of six months, but summary indicators are published on the central bank’s website with a two-month delay, and data in International Financial Statistics are timely and published 3 months afier the reference period. A money and banking statistics mission from Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - APPENDIX II the Statistics Department visited the Netherlands Antilles in December 1997. Most of its recommendations have been implemented and have led to substantive improvements in data and reporting, starting with end-1998 data. Pending the introduction of a new Chart of Accounts, which will be fully operational in 2000,the BNA has adopted an interim method, as suggested by the technical assistance mission, to ensure that reporting is done on a gross rather than a net basis to avoid underestimation of money and credit. A broadening of the coverage of the monetary statistics to include non-bank deposit taking institutions (e.g. credit unions, savings institutions) has been initiated, but is not complete. The recommendations to exclude foreign currency deposits from the definition of narrow money (Ml) and to limit the concept of international reserves to foreign exchange reserves of the BNA only have not been implemented. It should be noted, however, that sufficiently detailed information is published to allow the determination of these concepts. 6. The BNA collects balance of payments statistics primarily on the basis of exchange records, with supplementary information provided by foreign bank account holders, and an enterprise survey. All companies without a general exemption to obtain a license for their foreign exchange transactions, report these transactions monthly through their domestic banks to the central bank. Those companies that have obtained a general exemption for approval of their foreign exchange transactions submit data on transactions quarterly directly to the central bank. An October 1997 balance of payments statistics mission from the Statistics Department provided recommendations for the use of additional data sources, in particular from the direct investment survey and the Ministry of Finance (for data on grants and external debt). It was recommended that the Customs Office finalize the implementation of the Automated System for Customs Data, to improve the accuracy and timeliness of trade statistics and that a Balance of Payments Section be created within the BNA. Implementation of these recommendation has been initiated in early 1999 with the appointment of a head for this section, and significant progress is expected during the remainder of 1999. Even so, the small size and undiversified nature of the economy impart considerably volatility to individual items, making it difficult to interpret the statistics. In addition, the diversified and ever-changing structure of the offshore sector makes an appropriate classification of in- and outflows problematic.

This appendix presents two alternative scenarios for fiscal policy, with fundamentally different implications for macroeconomic developments during the 1999-2002 period (Table 5). Currently, fiscal policy faces a binding financing constraint, and its future course is a source of much uncertainty. The projections illustrate the need for immediate fiscal adjustment measures, the required magnitude of such efforts, and their likely beneficial effects on growth and international reserves. However, in the absence of national accounts data for recent years, it has not been possible to elaborate a medium-term savings-investment framework with an explicit connection between the fiscal and current account balances. Another caveat regarding the projections is that large additional fiscal outlays could result from contingent liabilities associated with the granting of guarantees on investment projects, the need to restructure public enterprises that have been making persistent losses, and legal claims against the government. A. BaseIine Scenario 2. The baseline projection, which assumes no policy changes other than those that have already been fully prepared, would result in an unsustainable fiscal deterioration. The projection shows a decline in the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio owing to the changes in indirect taxes in 1999 and the announced reductions in profit taxes for the onshore sector in 1999 and for offshore activities in 2000. The fiscal deterioration would be offset partly by the reduction in pension premiums in 1999 that was motivated by a perceived improvement in the actuarial position of the public sector pension fund, and a continued squeeze of public investment. Even so, the fiscal deficit would double already in the first year of the projection period, and rise further over the next three years. Over time, the problem would be compounded by the adverse repercussion of the high deficit on debt and interest rates, leading to increasing interest obligations. Even assuming a maximum fhrther build-up of arrears to the pension fund and no payment of foreign amortization, a sizable financing gap would remain. No voluntary net domestic lending to the government is anticipated in this scenario. In fact, the assumption of an almost complete roll-over of all maturing domestic public debt (5.8 percent of GDP in 1999) is already questionable given the apparent decline in investor confidence. 3. In the absence of fiscal adjustment, a recovery in economic growth or international reserves is highly unlikely. Growth is projected to remain subdued in the baseline scenario, as the uncertainty resulting from the worsening fiscal situation would adversely affect private investment. There would still be an increase in exports, largely reflecting new investments in the refinery and positive developments within the offshore financial sector, which are not much dependent on overall economic and fiscal developments. As a result of the fiscal expansion-and assuming the deficit could be financed other than through additional domestic arrears-imports would increase also. However, private capital inflows would dwindle and project aid inflows would be jeopardized, further depleting official reserves. Given that no monetary financing of the fiscal deficit is anticipated, inflation would remain under control. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 35 - APPENDIX III B. Adjustment Scenario 4. In the adjustment scenario, measures are included to reduce the government deficit, while allowing for increased public investment, and secure the soundness of the public sector pension system. On the revenue side, an immediate increase in the turnover tax rate would be partly offset in later years by a reduction in income and trade taxes, thus continuing the desirable shift from direct to indirect taxation. Expenditure measures would focus on reducing the wage bill, given that during the past three years wage drift largely negated the effects of an official wage freeze and efforts to increase public sector efficiency. Furthermore, public sector pensions and retrenchment benefits would be lowered to match those in the private sector. The main fiscal adjustment measures underlying this scenario are: (i) an increase in the turnover tax rate from 2 percent to 4 percent in mid-1999, combined with a reduction of tax exemptions; (ii) the reintroduction in 2000 of a nominal wage freeze; (iii) a structural reduction in the government’s annual pension premium obligations by about 1 percent of GDP (for example, by shifting a larger share of the premium to employees and introducing a pension deduction for the general old age pension for current retirees); (iv) a reduction in government employment by 25 percent (in line with earlier government proposals), combined with a shorter duration of layoff benefits. 5. The fiscal deficit is projected to be in line with available financing, without crowding out private investment, and after including the contributions to a sinking fund. This fimd-an important, but unfblfilled element of the 1997 adjustment program-would serve to prepare for the anticipated increase in pay-as-you-go pension obligations resulting from the 1996 pension reform. With sustained implementation of the adjustment program, the deficit would decrease to 1 percent of GDP by 2002. Deficit financing would include limited domestic borrowing, allowing room for a pick up in private sector investment. In 1999, however, the need for domestic borrowing would be substantially larger, as most of the adjustment measures would not yet have taken effect. This need could be met by a temporary increase in borrowing Corn the pension fLnd. The scenario includes a financing gap of more than 1 percent of GDP in 1999 to 2001 that could be met by temporary exceptional financing, following normalization of financial relations with external creditors. 6. Reestablishing the sustainability of public finances would complement other structural reforms in restoring confidence and competitiveness, and boosting economic growth. It would remove uncertainty, crucial to trigger a positive private investment response, which is expected to be financed from both the domestic and the international capital market Together with the projected increase in public investment, this would promote higher economic growth. Both imports and exports of goods and services would be boosted by such developments, while the external balance would deteriorate initially, financed by the higher net private capital inflows. Over time, the resulting structural increase in export growth would be reflected in a gradual improvement in official reserves, underpinning confidence in the fixed exchange rate regime which would keep inflation low.

The banking sector of the Netherlands Antilles comprises banks operating on the domestic market, and international banks, operating only internationally. As of September 30, 1998, there were 15 licensed domestic banks and 40 licensed international banks, but since then, a domestic bank’s license was withdrawn as it filed for liquidation. Concentration in the domestic banking sector is high, with 4 banks holding more than 75 percent of total banking system assets (Table 6). In the aggregate, credit to households dominates domestic banks’ portfolios, but all loans collateralized with real estate, even to businesses, are classified as credit to households, and there are specialized banks for which this does not hold. 2. Both domestic and international banks are supervised by the central bank, which focuses on capital adequacy and liquidity ratios and assesses earnings and the quality of assets and management. Capital adequacy ratios have generally exceeded the 8 percent floor for each bank (except at end-1995 as a result of hurricane damage) and, in the aggregate, stood at 8.4 percent for domestic banks at end-December 1998, and at 41.5 percent for international banks at end-September 1998. Liquidity deficits require prompt corrective action, unless a parent bank or head office has irrevocably guaranteed the bank’s obligations towards its creditors. Such actions were needed for three domestic and six international banks in 1998. One of these domestic banks is being liquidated, another one has raised capital, and the third one has adjusted its portfolio to remedy its liquidity deficit. The liquidity deficits of the six international banks have not yet been resolved, but third party exposure appears to be small. During 1998, ten on-site inspections were conducted, and enhanced supervision was recommended in four cases. 3. At present, risks to banking sector soundness appear limited, and stem mainly from weak economic activity and the budget’s financing difficulties. Increases in nonperforming loans, which will require further provisioning in 1999, fewer lending opportunities to creditworthy borrowers, and costs associated with the increased use of some monetary instruments, have put pressure on bank profitability, contributing to a decline in average pre-tax profit to 3.9 percent of assets in 1998. Given the precarious state of public finances, banking system liquidity, which includes holdings of government securities, may not be as high as it appears. However, net exposure to the public sector amounts to only 9 percent of assets. Intermediation spreads have remained high, reflecting inefficiencies and limited competition. 4. There have been no significant changes in banking supervision over the past two years, but the Y2K issue has received prominent attention. In July 1998, the central bank issued a policy memorandum on the implementation of the “Fit and Proper Test”. Banking supervision also took on the responsibility of building awareness for the Y2K problem, and on the basis of the responses to two surveys, one in August 1997 and one in April 1998, believes that the financial sector is making adequate progress in dealing with this issue.

C. 20431 USA Public Information Notice (PIN) No. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE MF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Netherlands Antilles On [...],the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation discussions with the Netherlands Antilles.’ Background Since the mid-l990s, the Antillean economy has been performing significantly below its potential, lagging behind trading partners and other Caribbean economies, as indicated by stagnating economic activity and a worrisome increase in unemployment. With the limited domestic resource base, the economy has suffered severely from the effects of several adverse external shocks which occurred during the past decade. The failure to tackle decisively ensuing large fiscal imbalances and to advance structural reforms to address rigidities in labor and product markets has hampered and lengthened the economy’s adjustment process. Budget deficits have been persistently exceeding available voluntary financing, but tight monetary controls have prevented monetization of deficits, and safeguarded the fixed exchange rate regime, which has contributed to low inflation. However, the accompanying buildup in arrears, mainly to the pension fund and external creditors, has been undermining- ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

The external current account deficit decreased somewhat as the result of weakening economic activity and some recovery in tourism, but net private capital inflows fell and official reserves have remained low, at about two months of imports of goods and nonfactor services. To deal with the fiscal and current account imbalances and restore growth, a comprehensive adjustment program was initiated in 1997, endorsed by the Fund staff and supported by financial assistance from the Netherlands. However, the program was not implemented as envisaged, and no adequate corrective action was taken to address further shortfalls in offshore profit taxes and non-tax revenues. As a result, the budget deficit remained high, at 3.3 percent of GDP in 1997, and arrears to the pension system and external creditors continued to accrue. Even so, progress was made in tackling several structural weaknesses of the budget. The tax system was improved with a shit? toward indirect taxation and a successful self-assesment system for profit taxes, which improved collection and compliance. Divestiture of noncore activities of the government, streamlining of the civil service, and pension reforms were initiatied. However, the extension of generous benefits and transitory subsidies to newly autonomous public entities, and some wage drift largely offset the expenditure savings of these reforms. Following the January 1998 elections, policy formulation and implementation have remained at a prolongued standstill. In an attempt to stimulate the economy, a new Economic Recovery Plan was initiated in late 1998, aimed at boosting investment in part through fiscal incentives. The plan failed to inspire confidence, though, largely because it was unclear how it would be financed and insufficiently coordinated between the central and island governments. It also lacked specificity in many areas. Without adjustment measures, the budget deficit is projected to double in 1999, which is likely to lead to serious cash flow difficulties for the public sector. Progress in dealing with structural problems has been mixed. In the labor market, the rigid mariner.... which the maximum duration of the workweek has been reduced, has raised labor costs. In the financial sector, adequate supervision has maintained the soundness of the banking system, contributed to preventing money laundering, and has been instrumental in preparing the sector for the Y2K issue. Legislative initiatives underway in the offshore sector bode well for its recovery. Although the trade regime is generally liberal, trade liberalization has slowed down. Limited progress has continued toward privatization, the elaboration of a regulatory framework for utilities, and the improvement in public enterprise performance. The statistical database has been improving, but severe deficiencies remain.
