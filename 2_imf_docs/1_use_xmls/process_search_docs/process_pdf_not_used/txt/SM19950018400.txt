However, unemployment remains high at a time when capacity constraints are already evident in important export industries. The coalition Government formed after the March 1995 elections appears united on the need to address fiscal and structural problems. At the same time, public opinion has coalesced around the view that Finland must avoid a return to the devaluation-inflation cycle of earlier times, setting a positive tone in advance of a potentially difficult round of wage negotiations this Fall. The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions in Helsinki during May 29-June 9, 1995 focussed on identifying policies to address these challenges, 1/ The 1994 Article IV consultation (SM/94/200, 7/29/94) was concluded on August 26, 1994 (EBM/94/75). Executive Directors welcomed the measures in the 1995 draft budget to contain real expenditures to 1991 levels as targeted but stressed the urgency of additional efforts in 1996 and beyond to stabilize public debt. In addition, they stated that monetary policy should focus on the 2 percent inflation target and that a nominal appreciation of the markka would forestall inflationary pressures in the traded goods sectors. The periodicity, timeliness, coverage, and quality of Finland's economic data are adequate for effective surveillance (Statistical Annex). I/ The staff team consisted of Messrs. Ebrill (head), Drees, and Miihleisen, EP (all EUl), Mr. Sharma (RES), and Ms. Chuidian, Administrative Assistant (EUl). The Finnish representatives included officials from the Bank of Finland, the Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Labor, the Central Organization of Trade Unions, and the Confederation of Finnish Industry and Employers. The mission also met with Mr. Lipponen, the Prime Minister, Mr. Viinanen, the Minister of Finance, and Ms. Hamalainen, the Governor of the Bank of Finland. Mr. Bergo, Executive Director, participated in the discussions.

The unemolovment rate fell from 19 per- cent in early 1994 to 17 percent in April 1995. However, -the recovery continues to be influenced by the previous recession that had elements of a debt-deflation cycle. The roots of the recession lay in an overheating in response to financial liberalization and favorable terms of trade movements in the 198Os, resulting in a rapid expansion of the sheltered sectors and a surge in asset prices. The subsequent weakening of demand in 1990 owed much to a sharp reversal in asset prices, and was compounded by the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union in 1991 and a plunge in paper and pulp prices. The decline in asset prices in turn precipitated a banking crisis and a jump in saving rates as households tried to repair balance sheets. The markka depreciated sharply in the face of these pressures. On the one hand, this depreciation interacted with the large share of foreign- currency denominated corporate debt to exacerbate the vicious circle of deteriorating balance sheets and falling domestic demand. On the other hand, however, the devaluation combined with improved productivity to lay the basis for a strong export-led recovery that has now reached the point where capacity constraints are being reached in manufacturing. Thus, in 1994, for the third consecutive year, the volume of exports rose by more than 10 percent, with the effect that the output gap in the metal and engineering sector and in forest industries has effectively been eliminated, whereas in construction and most private services large gaps remain, l/ That said, the signs of a transition to a more balanced recovery are evident. Largely due to a 5 l/2 percent increase in private investment, domestic demand increased last year, benefitting the sheltered sectors. Moreover, in contrast to previous years, the export increase in 1994 was not based on additional improvements in competitiveness--indeed, the markka appreciated significantly during the year- -but rather on the recovery in partner countries (including the transition economies), and improved terms of trade as pulp and paper prices rebounded (Chart 2). Given the import increase due to the upturn in domestic demand, the trade surnlus stabilized at 6 l/2 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, there was a current account surplus last year for the first time in 15 year.s, reflecting a sharp decline in the services deficit, and Finland's net foreign indebtedness declined from 55 percent in 1993 to 50 percent of GDP by end-1994 (Table 2). Inflation currently is subdued, owing partly to the appreciation of the markka. Consumer price inflation has been below 2 percent (annual rate) in recent months. The Bank of Finland's (130F) indicator for its inflation target has been somewhat lower, though largely reflecting once-off factors I/ The Bank of Finland estimates output gaps for construction and the trade, restaurant, hotel sectors at 31 percent and 22 percent, respectively.

I-J However, against the backdrop of a strong recovery and the improved terms of trade, several factors point toward higher consumer price inflation ahead. Influenced by traded goods prices, producer price inflation accelerated during 1994 and reached about 4 percent (annual rate) in recent months. In addition, stumpage prices, the asset price for timber that in the past has had a strong influence on wages and domestic demand, rose by 21 percent in 1994, with further increases in early 1995. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, wage increases, which had been less than 2 percent in 1994 despite large productivity gains, should average about 5 percent in 1995 following the outcome of last Fall's wage round. With slower productivity growth as capacity limits are approached, manufacturing unit labor costs in 1995 will rise for the first time in 4 years (Table 1). The central government fiscal deficit widened from 10 percent of GDP in 1993 to about 10 l/2 percent in 1994 (Chart 4), with no improvement in prospect this year. This has occurred despite fiscal packages over the past four years that officials estimate have reduced expenditures by 5 percentage points of GDP and reflects several factors, including: (i) sharp increases in unemployment benefits and interest payments; (ii) the direct fiscal costs of EU accession; and (iii) the failure of fiscal measures to produce sufficient structural change in expenditure programs. As an implication of these developments, central government debt reached 60 percent of GDP by end-1994, compared with 10 percent in 1990. The level of gross public debt (EMU consolidation) has also reached 60 percent. Subsequent to floating the markka in September 1992, the stated objective of monetarv policv became to contain underlying inflation at about 2 percent from 1995 on. 2/ Given that the real exchange rate would likely have appreciated in any event from the low levels reached following the decision to float (Chart 2), a focus has been on ensuring that this appreciation occur through a strengthening of the currency rather than through inflation. Despite episodic weakness, the markka has appreciated by some 25 percent in nominal effective terms since early 1993, almost recovering to its pre-float level (Chart 5). Particularly since mid-1994, and coinciding with strong export growth and the improved terms of trade, the currency has been appreciating steadily, easily weathering the financial market turbulence of early 1995. As a result of favorable wage and productivity developments, the real effective exchange rate (ULC basis) is, however, still more than 15 percent below its mid-1980s level (Chart 2). I/ The BoF targets an indicator of underlying inflation that corrects the CPI for indirect taxes, subsidies, and the capital costs of owner-occupied housing. This measure has been temporarily depressed by about 1 percentage point by lower food prices following EU accession. For the CPI, this factor was broadly balanced by indirect tax increases. 2/ The BoF uses a range of indicators, including the exchange rate, interest rates, the yield curve, and the monetary aggregates, to guide interpretation of monetary conditions under inflation targeting.

After the 3-month money market rate (HELIBOR) had fallen to German levels in December, the BoF raised the tender rate--its main interest rate instrument --by 50 basis points (Chart 6). There was a further 25 basis point increase in February 1995. One confirmation of the tightening is the reduced growth rate of the monetary aggregates (Chart 7). Against this background, public confidence has been bolstered by the Government's commitment to address the fiscal imbalances, as was dramati- cally evidenced by the 100 basis point decline in long-term interest rates following the announcement of the new Government's fiscal package. II. Economic Outlook There was broad agreement between the authorities and the staff on the outlook for 1995. Strong GDP growth of at least 5 percent is in prospect, based principally on a further recovery in domestic demand. At the same time, healthy competitiveness, supported by terms of trade gains and continued expansion among major partners, will result in an external current account surplus of about 2 l/2 percent of GDP. Owing in part to the appreciation of the markka, and despite an increase in manufacturing unit labor costs, inflation should be below the 2 percent target. The transition to a recovery increasingly reliant on domestic demand should continue in 1996 -* The official forecast for the year, with which the mission broadly agrees, envisages growth moderating to about 4 l/2 percent, inflation of about 2 l/2 percent, and a smaller current account surplus (1 percent of GDP). There are imponderables, however. First, while a strong increase in investment is likely in light of surging profitability and capacity constraints, the prospect for private consumption is more uncertain, depending on: the deflationary impact of deficit reduction that would be in part mitigated by lower real interest rates; the positive impact of strengthened balance sheets; and confidence engendered by the recovery. On balance, however, private consumption is expected to increase modestly. A second imponderable is the inflation outlook. Capacity constraints are evident in manufacturing. Together with the strength of the terms of trade, the concomitant increased profitability of major industries, and stumpage price increases, this could trigger significant increases in manufacturing wages in the Fall wage round. In the past, wage awards in manufacturing have tended to spill over to sheltered sectors with lower productivity growth. To the extent that this occurs in 1996, the task of defending the inflation target would be significantly complicated. The official medium-term Droiections indicate that unemployment would remain as high as 12 l/2 percent in 1999 despite output growth averaging above 3 percent annually during 1997-1999. The mission views the projec- tions as broadly realistic. Estimates of the natural rate of unemployment are typically about 10 percent, taking into account the specific shocks Finland has experienced that, inter alia, may have rendered obsolete a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 1.2 - CHART 6 FINLAYD INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST RATE DIFFERENTIALS 1E.D r (In percent) 16.0 A 3-month HELIBOR (August I, 1992 - July II, 1995) r (In percentage points) 1 18.0 160 14.0 I2.0 10.0 8.0 60 40 60 6.0 40 20 0.0 -2.0 I- , - IOC QC 6.0 70 5.0 ,I ( - (In ,3ercentage points) vu Jl 17 >- ,- 3 ( 2.5 20 !5 10 0.5 JU ii-h DC1 DEC FE9 APR JUN AUG DC1 DEC FEE APR JUI 1993 1994 1995 - (In percent) zl.l111 I1 I I I I I IN AUG DC1 OEC FE9 APR JUN AUG OCT DEC FEE APR It6 1993 1994 1995 Flnnlsh lOyear bond yield mlnus German lo-year bond ylelc (June 3. 1993 - July IO. 1995) Il.0 10.0 8.0 7.0 5.0 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 15 I.0 1.5 Squrces: Bank of Finland, Finonciol Markets (various issues); IMF, Surveillance Data Bose and Rauters.

Moreover, the failure to close the output gap more rapidly reflects the dualism of the recovery, labor market rigidities, and the need for further rationalization in sheltered industries such as financial services and retailing. However, the spreading of the recovery to the more labor-intensive sheltered sectors may result in a better-than-envisaged employment outcome. The other notable feature in the outlook is the emergence of a general government surplus of 2 percent of GDP by 1999 (with a corresponding central government deficit of about 2 percent). This surplus requires careful interpretation since general government includes the privately managed though mandatory pension plans that account for a large share of retirement income. Although the plans are currently running large cash surpluses (more than 4 percent of GDP annually over the medium term), they are nonetheless largely unfunded and Finland faces adverse demographic trends. L/ Finally, the outlook envisages modest external current account surpluses through the medium term with inflation Less than 3 percent annually. The authorities intend to finalize their Convergence Program for the EU in the coming months. III. Policy Discussions The conduct of financial policies in the past two years has set the basis for sustained recovery with low inflation. In particular, monetary policy in the past year has encouraged a significant currency appreciation, the full impact of which has yet to be felt. That appreciation is working to counter potential inflationary pressures in the traded-goods sector. However, with domestic demand now picking up, the recovery is entering a new phase that calls for a rebalancing of financial policies. The highest priority is for fiscal consolidation. Such consolidation has been urgently required for some time to stabilize and reverse the rising trend in the public debt ratio. With the growing need to make room for private demand and to support the monetary authorities in their task of defending the 2 percent inflation target, the case for significant deficit reduction has been greatly strengthened. Wage moderation wouLd also be important. In that context, further structural reforms, with a focus on labor markets, and, in particular, unemployment insurance, are also urgent. 1. Fiscal policy There is currently a consensus at all Levels of Government and in the public at large to address. the central government fiscal deficit. Officials agreed that fiscal consolidation is needed to bring debt accumulation under lJ Pension fund assets equal about 4.0 percent of GDP while pension Liabilities, according to official estimates, amount to about 200 percent of GDP. Moreover, indicative of Finland's demographic prospects, the depend'ency ratio is projected to increase from 31 percent in 1990 to 38 l/2 percent in 2010. Issues concerning pensions and Finnish demographics are comprehensively discussed in the 1995 OECD Economic Survey for Finland.

They accepted the thrust of staff calculations indicating that current budget policies, even under optimistic macroeconomic assumptions, would result in a debt ratio that would exceed 90 percent of GDP in 2000 compared with 60 percent at end-1994. LJ They recognized that fiscal action is also now needed to accommodate increased private demand to avoid pressures on the external current account and on prices. They noted, however, that the 1995 central government deficit of about 11 percent of GDP would be inflated by once-off revenue effects, including the postponement of a tax refund (l/2 percent of GDP) from 1994, as well as by the costs of EU accession (about 2 percent of GDP) that are expected to abate somewhat. Nonetheless, indicative of the effort required to stabilize the debt ratio, the primary deficit will be about 8 percent of GDP in 1995. The Government has announced significant fiscal consolidation plans (see box). Apart from a modest revenue neutral shift of the tax burden from Labor to capital, revenue policies are held unchanged given the high tax burden. 2/ Accordingly, the emphasis is on expenditure cuts, with fiscal targets being stated in terms of expenditure ceilings. In assessing the plans, the mission considered the expenditure path that would attain the official target of stabilizing the central government debt ratio at 70 percent by 1997- -the timing of stabilizing the debt ratio may be as important as the absolute level of that ratio, since current economic conditions are likely the most propitious for breaking the adverse path of debt dynamics. However, as discussed more fully in Appendix I, although having a major impact on debt accumulation, the envisaged actions are likely not sufficient to satisfy the official target. First, even if the official expenditure target (Fmk 193 billion) in the 1996 budget is achieved, staff projections indicate that the consolidation plans will not quite deliver the envisaged break in debt dynamics in 1997. Second, perhaps more important, achieving the 1996 expenditure target could well require more than the envisaged Fmk 10 billion in cuts. J/ In the event it is not possible to strengthen fiscal plans in the 1996 budget--quite likely given budgetary planning--the staff proposed that: (i) the 1996 budget should strictly adhere to the Fmk 193 billion ceiling; (ii) the same expenditure ceiling should be set for 1997, to be achieved by implementing all the as-yet-unspecified cuts of Fmk 5 billion in 1997; and LJ The staff's medium-term fiscal scenarios are discussed in Appendix I. One scenario in which fiscal inaction feeds into the macroeconomic outlook generates a debt ratio of 100 percent by 2000. 2/ The envisaged revenue changes are elaborated upon in the RED paper. 2/ If the ceiling of Fmk 193 billion for 1996 is satisfied, noninterest expenditures would be some Fmk 14 billion below the official "no policy change" baseline, implying that attaining the projected fiscal target may require larger cuts than the Fmk 10 billion being cited for 1996 in the proposed fiscal package.

This plan would with greater assurance stabilize the debt ratio in 1997, with modest reductions subsequently. Fiscal Consolidation Plans l The savings measures in the 1995 budget (about 2 percent of GDP) are to be made permanent. l Further permanent expenditure cuts of Fmk 20 billion (about 4 percent of GDP) are to be implemented over the next four years, with a focus on reductions in transfers to local governments, public pensions, and other social security benefits. Fmk 10 billion is to be implemented in 1996. Moreover, some cuts, viz., in children's allowance, student grants, and subsidies to industry, are to be implemented this year. The Fmk 5 billion in cuts yet to be specified will be announced this summer. l While not directly related to the budget, the labor market parties have agreed to reform the employment pension scheme, eventually reducing pension expenditures by 4 percent of the payroll (2 percent of GDP). I J Responding, officials stressed that they remain committed to reversing the trend in the debt ratio. Their immediate focus is on implementing what they have already promised. They noted that the initial submissions by the spending Ministries were broadly consistent with the expenditure target and they did not envisage the need for supplementary budgets, a staff concern. 'The fiscal consolidation envisaged under the Government's plans would imply general government balance as early as 1998 with surpluses of about 2 percent of GDP in the medium term. The mission pointed out that this is warranted in light of the future demographic demands faced by the pension schemes consolidated under general government. The authorities wholeheartedly agreed, adding, as noted earlier, that even with the already announced significant reflorm and the large current cash surpluses, the pension plans remained largely unfunded. 2. Monetary and exchanpe rate oolicv Discussions focused on two issues, namely, (i) the transparency of monetary policy, and (ii) the conduct Iof monetary policy in the period ahead, with capacity constraints in manufacturing/traded goods. There has been progress in enhanc,i.ng the transparency, and hence the credibility, of the inflation target. In part this owed to the recent clarification that, rather than view the target as a maximum, the BoF is seeking to keep underlying inflation on average to 2 percent from 1995 on. In addition, the new Government has explicitly supported the target and public acceptance has grown. Officials would, however, be unwilling to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - specify a range for the inflation target itself out of a concern that the upper limit would be viewed as the effective target. They would also be unwilling to publish inflation forecasts, preferring instead to publicly discuss the policy and other requirements for a positive inflation outcome. On how the BoF's operational procedures can improve transparency, officials pointed to the recent change whereby the tender rate is being used as a policy indicator to better inform markets of official intentions. Against the background of favorable financial market developments, as indicated by the strength of the markka and declines in long-term interest rates, the mission discussed the outlook for.infLation. Work was continuing to refine interpretation of the range of indicators used to guide policy. These indicators were currently providing mixed signals, with the behavior of monetary aggregates reassuring, but with the recent surge in stumpage prices causing concern. u That said, in light of the explicit tightening in monetary conditions late last year and early this year, the mission suggested that current conditions were broadly appropriate. However, the staff noted, the inflation target would be increasingly difficult to achieve in the face of a continuing recovery, a tension reflected in many private forecasts pointing to inflation of about 3 percent in 1996. These forecasts recognize the concern that wage awards in manufacturing could be transmitted economy wide despite high unemployment and that the current low underlying inflation rate reflects the recent exchange rate appreciation and the once- off impact of food price declines following EU accession. Consequently, the staff cautioned that some tightening of monetary conditions could be warranted if it became more evident that wage demands were building up in the coming round of negotiations. The authorities also were concerned about this prospect. In the event, on June 9, the BoF preemptively raised the tender rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent as a signal of concern. As regards the exchanee rate, with its recent appreciation, the markka has almost returned to the 1992 pre-float midpoint (vis-a-vis the ECU). The authorities emphasized that there had been no official intervention in recent months when the markka had in effect paralleled the deutsche mark. In contrast to last year, they no longer saw a clear case for a policy favoring a nominal appreciation so as to forestall inflationary pressures arising through an unwinding of an overly depreciated currency. They had no firm view on the "equilibrium" real exchange rate. However, in assessing competitiveness, 'the forest industry was sensitive to movements in the dollar and the Swedish krona, both of which had depreciated significantly against the markka. That said, officials agreed that a further modest market driven appreciation should not be ruled out and could be tolerated from a competitiveness perspective. They also agreed that a significant depreciation would compromise inflation goals and readily accepted the importance of sound policies in general to support the exchange rate. I/ The mission presented their own technical work (Appendix I of the RED paper) which broadly concurred with research at the Bank. That paper also elaborates on some factors influencing the inflation process in Finland. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 1.8 - Concerning the exchange rate regime itself, officials see advantages for now in the flexibility afforded by floating exchange rates, but at the same time they anticipated that Finland would be among the first to enter EMU. Finally, officials 'were confident about the prospects for legislation strengthening the BoF's independence by assigning sole responsibility for the conduct of monetary plolicy to its Board of Management. 3. Labor market and waee behavior I/ In addition to financial policies, inflation in 1996 will depend crucially on the outcome of the Fall round of wage negotiations. Staff pointed to two risks: (i) with the terms of trade improvement, the associated surge in profitability, and biting capacity constraints, wage pressures are likely in some industries; and (ii) of even greater concern, large wage awards could be transmitted economy wide despite unemployment. Officials observed that the outlook for wage moderation had improved with the explicit recognition by the negotiating partners of the importance of low inflation. Responding to the caution that there could still be substantial demands for large real wage increases, they noted that that was precisely why a return to more centralized wage bargaining was increasingly favored. Finland is highly unionized and, realistically, the alternative is not that of completely decentralized bargaining, but rather bargaining at the branch union level. In Last December's round, branch union bargaining had produced relatively large wage awards economy wide. With confidence in the recovery now firmly established, the fear is of even less discipline in the coming round. The mission accepted the Logic of this position, but stressed that if the centralized mode were selected, the package-deal solutions typically associated with that mode should not compromise other policy objectives, notably, fiscal cons*oLidation and Labor market reform. This last point bears on the risks for inflation posed by the intersectoral wage links that have been evident in Finland. Officials shared staff concerns that unemployment does not exercise much restraint on wages. The staff suggested that this was in part due to the generosity of unemployment insurance, in particular, the granting of full benefits for 500 days and the relatively Liberal eligibility c,riteria. Officials noted that eligibility criteria had b,een tightened--in particular, through increased waiting periods for school leavers--and that further reform was a priority. 4. Other structural issues l Banking system u Profitability is improving only slowly. The recent sale of Skopbank, that had been taken over by the Government during the banking crisis, marked the end of the crisis phase. Officials provided LJ See also Appendix II of the RED paper, which, inter alia, describes the structure of wage bargaining in greater detail. 2/ The Nordic banking crisis is also discussed in WP/95/61.

However, other than for agriculture, the efficiency gains had already largely been garnered through the EEA agreement, though the textile and food processing industries still face major restructuring. National support (beyond EU support) for agriculture is projected to decline from Fmk 8.7 bil- lion in 1995 to about Fmk 5 billion in 2000. l Trade policy Implementation of commitments associated with accession to-the EU and the Uruguay Round agreement is proceeding smoothly. l Official deveLoDment assistance (ODA) ODA has declined from 0.81 percent of GDP in 1991 to 0.38 in 1994. The Government has not yet set a schedule for returning to traditional levels. IV. Staff Appraisal Recent developments in Finland have been favorable, as evidenced by the robust growth with low inflation. Underlying this, elements of the debt- deflation cycle that had exacerbated the recession are now working in reverse through a positive interaction between domestic demand and improving balance sheets. Indeed, with the clear signs of an upturn in domestic demand, the recovery is entering a new phase. At the same time, however, some capacity constraints are being reached with unemployment still high. In these circumstances, the task of sustaining the recovery and reducing unemployment while also defending the inflation objective calls for a rebalancing of financial policies. The highest priority is fiscal consolidation. The argument of the past stressing the urgency of reversing an unsustainable path of debt accumu- lation is now reinforced by the need to reduce the deficit to accommodate the higher investment and lower private saving in prospect as the recovery continues. Thereby also, Finland will run the current account surpluses that,wiLl reduce its high foreign indebtedness. More generally, full advantage should be taken of the present robust activity to reduce the fiscal deficit and contain the growth of public debt. The new Government clearly recognizes the urgency of addressing the fiscal imbalance and has announced major plans for permanent reductions in expenditures. Although commendable, particularly in conjunction with planned pension reform, the proposed actions are Likely insufficient to deliver the envisaged break in debt dynamics. Accordingly, should it be impossible to strengthen plans for the near term, it would be important to avoid slippages from current deficit reduction plans, possibly implying the need for further measures during 1996, and to front load the yet-to-be- specified measures in the 1997 budget.

As evidenced by the strength of the markka and inflation currently below the target Level, policy has been broadly successful. In addition, the increased transparency of monetary policy is welcome. However, while it has been relatively easy to keep inflation low in the face of weak demand, price stability is Likely to be increasingly threatened as the recovery continues. Moreover, although some further appreciation could be accommodated without excessively com- promising competitiveness, future exchange rate developments are unlikely to support low inflation as much as in the recent past. In these circum- stances, the success of monetary policy will depend, inter alia, on fiscal policy and wage behavior. However, the Bank of Finland should continue to gear its policy to defend the inflation target. Achieving the target is valuable both in its own right and to set ,the conditions for Finland's joining the final stage of EMU. The recent decision to increase the tender rate provides further evidence of the Bank's determination in that regard. A key to avoiding a return to the devaluation-inflation cycle that has bedeviled Finland in the 'past lies in wage moderation. The recent indica- tions that the outlook for wage moderation in the coming round has improved are welcome. However, thle preconditions for wage pressures, notably an improved terms of trade for Finland's forest-based industries and an associated surge in corporate profitability, are already in place. Accordingly, it would be important to ensure that the labor market parties, irrespective of the negotiation mode selected, agree on wage increases that will support attainment o:E the inflation target and, in particular, avoid the economy wide transmittal of wage increases awarded in manufacturing. The objectives of wage moderation and lower unemployment will be facilitated by additional measures enhancing Labor market flexibility and strengthening competition more generally. Reforms to unemployment insurance that strengthen the incentives for job search would be important. Competi- tion will be usefully bolstered by the liberalization associated with EU accession and implementation of the Uruguay Round commitments. Finland's traditionally generous official develoDment assistance program has been a casualty of budget cutbacks. The authorities are encouraged to restore its assistance Levels as soon as feasible. Surveillance of Finland has been greatly facilitated by the open spirit of the discussions and the high quality of data. In particular, the continuing refinement of the methodology underlying official medium-term fiscal projections is welcome. It is recommended thart the next Article IV consultation with Finland will be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Three scenarios are considered. 1. "No-action" baseline This scenario assumes unchanged policies derived from Ministry of Finance (MoF) revenue and expenditure projections. Specifically, the MoF assumes that total expenditures (excluding interest and EU-related expenditures) will grow by 2 percent annually in real terms over the medium term (Table Al). Since one can only arbitrarily model the impact of fiscal inaction on financial markets, the alternative.of assuming steady monetary tightening to defend the inflation target with a smooth dampening impact on growth is selected. The central government deficit declines from 11 percent of GDP in 1995 to 8 l/2 percent of GDP in 1996, but climbs subsequently to almost 12 percent of GDP in 2000, at which point the central government debt ratio has reached 100 percent. 2. Official "tareet scenario" This scenario attempts to capture the Government's fiscal policy intentions. The macroeconomic outlook is generally favorable, with steady if declining growth to 2000, as the economy trends to potential, and inflation contained below 3 percent. The revenue assumptions are as in the baseline since revenue policy changes are to be modest and revenue neutral. Total expenditures (excluding interest and EU- related expenditure) would fall by 3 percentage points of GDP, or by 6 per- cent in real terms, from 1995 to 1996. Subsequently, these expenditures would decline by 1.5 percent annually in real terms. As a result, the deficit would fall to 6 percent of GDP next year, and to 2 l/2 percent in 2000. However, the debt ratio would not stabilize in 199-7 as envisaged. Perhaps more important, if the expenditure path is achieved, non interest expenditures in 1996 will be Fmk 14 billion below the official baseline (that shares a common macroeconomic outlook with the official target scenario), a difference that will grow to Fmk 27 billion by 1999. This highlights the tension between official deficit projections and the announced fiscal package of Fmk 20 billion in cuts with Fmk 10 billion to be implemented in 1996--more fiscal consolidation may be needed to support the Government's fiscal objectives. 3. Staff scenario This scenario, which shares the same macroeconomic outlook as the previous scenario, envisages somewhat greater fiscal consolidation than envisaged by the Government. How much greater will depend on how much more is needed to deliver the Government's own expenditure objectives. Specifically, the staff assumes attainment of the Fmk 193 billion expenditure target, with that ceiling extended to 1997 (to be achieved by fully implementing the as yet unspecified cuts of Fmk 5 billion) with total expenditures held constant in real terms in subsequent years. In this scenario, there would be a primary surplus in 1997, with the central goverment debt ratio peaking at 70 percent. The associated general government debt ratio would decline to 60 percent in 2000. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - APPENDIX I Table Al.

Executive Directors welcomed evidence that Finland's severe recession was finally over, but cautioned that the recovery would inevitably be uneven. They supported the measures in the 1995 draft budget to meet the Government's expenditure target, however at the same time they stressed the urgency of additional efforts in 1996 and beyond to stabilize public debt. Agreeing that monetary policy should focus on the 2 percent (underlying) inflation target, Executive Directors noted that a further nominal appreciation of the markka would forestall inflationary pressures in the traded-goods sector.
