The overall fiscal deficit was kept below the program limit of 1% percent of GDP; however, the primary fiscal surplus was 2.6 percent of GDP compared with 2.8 percent of GDP in the program due, in part, to lower-than-projected federal government nontax revenue and higher- than-projected public enterprise expenditure. Real GDP increased by 3.7 percent in 1999, with the recovery driven by exports, investment, and private consumption. The 12-month inflation rate in December 1999 was 12.3 percent (the of5icial target was 13 percent) and declined further to under 11 percent in February 2000. The external current account deficit narrowed to 3 percent of GDP in 1999, reflecting the improved terms of trade and increased non-oil exports. Capital flows were higher than projected, led by foreign investment, and NIB rose by US%3.9 billion in 1999 (compared with a program target of no change); NIB increased by US%3 billion in the first two months of 2000. Policy issues and the 2000 economic program The 2000 program aims at reducing end-period inflation to 10 percent with real GDP growth recovering to 4% percent. While the political calendar constrains moving ahead with structural reforms in the tax area (presidential elections are scheduled for July 2000), the economic program continues to maintain prudent fiscal and monetary policies. In particular, the government’s 2000 budget (the overall public sector deficit is programmed to decline to 1 percent of GDP based on a conservative oil price) and the Bank of Mexico’s monetary program for 2000 are largely consistent with the original economic policy objectives described in the June 1999 Letter of Intent and the Memorandum of Economic Policies. The economic program also focuses on the reform of the banking system with particular emphasis on compliance with the measures specified in the attached structural matrix, the activities of the Bank Savings Protection Institute (IPAB), and the recapitalization of the banking system. While the banking system remains undercapitalized, the authorities are taking measures to allow for a gradual convergence toward financial soundness, including actions taken recently that strengthen the regulatory framework and the operations of IPAB, as well as work toward smoothing the maturity profile of IPAB’s sizable obligations, The authorities are requesting a waiver for the lower-than-programmed primary surplus in 1999. The staff supports this request on the grounds that the deviation is small and that the authorities are improving further their control mechanisms over the public finances.

Discussions for the 2000 Article IV consultation and first and second reviews under the l7-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) approved on July 7, 1999 in the amount of SDR 3,103 million (120 percent of quota) were conducted in Mexico City during October 22-November 5, 1999, December 6-10, 1999, and January 24-28,200O.l Assuming the full purchase of the remaining resources available under the SBA, Fund credit outstanding to Mexico would decline from 126 percent of quota at end-1999 to 122 percent of quota at end-2000 (Table 1). Fund financial relations with Mexico are presented in Appendix I. Relations with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank are presented in Appendices II and III, respectively. 2. At the authorities’ request, the Letter of Intent, the Memorandum on Economic Policies, and the Technical Memorandum for the 2000 program were finalized only after congressional approval of the budget and the preparation of the monetary program for 2000 by the Bank of Mexico. As a result, the staff was able to set quarterly performance criteria for the 2000 program, enabling it to combine the first and second reviews under the SBA; upon completion of these reviews, SDR 905 million would be made available to Mexico. The final review should be completed by end-June 2000. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on September 4 1998 &I/98/1 8 l), Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ prompt policy iesponse to the possible contagion from the global market turbulence and noted Mexico’s improved resilience to external shocks. However, they stressed the need to contain external imbalances and to address the weaknesses in the financial sector. Developments since the last Article IV consultation were reviewed by the Executive Board at the time of the approval of the current SBA (EBS/99/97). 4. Since the 1994-95 economic crisis, there have been major improvements in the quality, coverage, and timeliness of data made available by the Mexican authorities to the Fund and to the public. Mexico subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and was among a group of 18 countries that inaugurated the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) on the Internet. Important progress was made in 1999 regarding private sector external debt statistics; in addition, a monitoring system of commercial bank i Staff members participating in one or more rounds of the discussions comprised Mr. Kalter (Head), Ms. Krieger, Mr. Mandeng (all WHD); Messrs. Cubeddu (FAD), B&o, de la Piedra, and Pancorbo (MAE), Almeida (PDR), and Ms. Herrera (Assistant, WI/ID). Messrs. Loser and Bonangelino participated in the final round of policy discussions. Mr. Carstens, the Executive Director for Mexico, also participated in the discussions. The mission was assisted by Mr. Van Houten, and Mr. Mu&, who replaced Mr. Van Houten at the beginning of 2000 as the Fund’s senior resident representative.

The authorities have committed under the program to further improve the quality of economic statistics (Appendix IV ) . IL RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT 5. Unsettled conditions in international capital markets and a decline in world oil prices in 1998 disrupted the recovery in economic activity that Mexico had experienced after the 1994-95 economic and financial crisis. Real GDP expanded by 5 percent in 1998, but decelerated toward the end of the year (to 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier), reflecting a significant slowing in investment and consumption growth (Table 2). Inflation accelerated to 18.6 percent during 1998, attributable largely to a marked depreciation of the peso. The external current account deficit widened to 3.8 percent of GDP in 1998 mostly due to a decline in oil export prices, but was fully covered by private capital inflows. The government reacted quickly to the adverse external shocks, cutting expenditure by 0.7 percentage point of GDP, while the Bank of Mexico (BOM) tightened monetary policy on several occasions. 6. Economic performance in 1999 was good and all except one quantitative performance criteria under the SBA for end-December were met, in some cases with large margins (i.e., on NIB, NDA, and external borrowing) (Table 3). The overall fiscal deficit was kept below the program limit of 1 L/4 percent of GDP; however, the primary fiscal surplus was 2.6 percent of GDP compared with 2.8 percent of GDP in the program due, in part, to lower-than-projected federal government nontax revenue and higher-than-projected public enterprise expenditure (Table 4). Real GDP increased by 3.7 percent in 1999, with the recovery initially driven by higher exports and investment, but in recent months the contribution of private consumption has taken on an increasing importance (Figure 1). The 1Zmonth inflation rate declined to 12.3 percent in December, below the official target of 13 percent (and to less than 11 percent in February 2000).* 7. Public sector revenues in 1999 were slightly higher than programmed, with stronger oil-related revenues and social security contributions more than offsetting lower privatization proceeds and transfers of central bank profits (due to a more appreciated value of the peso). Expenditures were also higher than programmed with lower external interest payments (also due to the more appreciated value of the peso) more than offset by increased spending bypublic enterprises. Primary spending was 0.3 percentage point of GDP higher than programmed (with the overrun taking place in the fourth quarter). The augmented deficit * While annual inflation of tradable goods declined to 10.3 percent in 1999 from 19.6 percent in 1998, inflation of nontradable goods declined more gradually to 14.8 percent from 17.8 percent (see Figure 1).

The BOM maintained a bias toward tightening throughout 1999 in the context of international capital market uncertainty and a strong commitment to meet the inflation objective. Nevertheless, the monetary base grew significantly more than projected starting in September, due in part to Y2K-related concerns (Table 5). So far, the monetary base has been in line with its projected path through February. Broad money growth accelerated during 1999 in the context of the decline in the inflation rate and greater market confidence. However, private sector credit from the banking system declined by 10% percent in real terms, continuing a’ trend registered since 1995 (Box 1). 9. The external current account deficit narrowed to an estimated 2.9 percent of GDP in 1999, reflecting the improved terms of trade and increased non-oil exports (Table 6). Despite higher oil prices, this improvement was less than envisaged (the program deficit was 2.2 percent of GDP) owing to stronger domestic demand (leading to faster import growth, especially of investment goods, permitted in part by increased access to international capital markets). Capital inflows were higher than projected, led by foreign direct investment, which covered about % percent of the current account deficit. Net international reserves (NTR) rose by US$3.9 billion in 1999 (compared with a program target of no change). Gross international reserves at end-1999 amounted to US$32 billion, equivalent to 3.2 months of next year’s imports of goods and services and 72 percent of short-term debt (by residual maturity). (NIR rose by US$3 billion in the first two months of 2000.) Short-term domestic interest rates declined by more than 1,700 basis points to 16% percent through December and the stock market index rose sharply (Figure 2). 10. Productivity and employment indicators continued to improve in 1999, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years (Box 2). Average labor productivity increased by 2 percent in January-November compared with a year earlier, while manufacturing employment rose by 1 percent during this period, and real wages were roughly unchanged. The open unemployment rate declined to 2.2 percent at end-1999 from 2.6 percent at end- 1998. While the real effective exchange rate based on relative consumer prices continued to appreciate during 1999, the improvement in labor productivity since the mid-1990s has contributed to Mexico maintaining its external competitiveness, as indicated by movements in the real effective exchange rate based on relative unit labor costs (Figure.3). Non-oil export growth remained buoyant. 11.

EVOLUTION OF CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR Domestic bank credit to the nonbank private sector declined by 21 percent in real terms on an annual average basis during 1995-99. However, the historical composition of credit reveals that domestic bank credit alone may not provide an adequate indication of the availability of credit in the economy: l Domestic direct credit to the nonbank private sector grew from 21.3 percent of GDP in 1990 to 46.7 percent in 1994, aud then fell to 16.2 percent of GDP in 1999. l Adjusted domestic credit to the nonbank private sector (including loans sold to FOBAPROA and loans converted into inflation indexed units (UDI)) dechned from 46.7 percent of GDP in 1994 to 30.3 percent of GDP in 1999. l Corporate external indebtedness increased from 6 percent of GDP in 1994 to an estimated 10 percent of GDP in 1999. l Nonbank domestic sources of credit to the nonbank private sector have remained stable at 6.6 percent of GDP during 1994-99. The evolution of credit to the nonbank private sector may in part be explained by a shift in the equilibrium level of domestic credit following a period of excessive credit expansion. The composition of credit has also changed, as reflected in a lesser decline in adjusted credit to the private sector compared with domestic direct credit, revealing a shift from bank credit to restructured credit. The increase in external indebtedness may also, in part have substituted for domestic credit. Continued lower wages- wages and salaries declined from 35.3 percent of disposable income in 1994 to 29.6 percent of disposable income in 1997 and real wages in manufacturing have remained on average about 20 percent below their 1994 level-may have allowed fmns to generate more profits and use retained earnings as an internal source of finance.

MANIJFA- G l?RODUClWlTY IN MEXICO The Mexican manufacturing sector has seen major efficiency gains since the mid-199Os, with labor productivity increasing at an average annual pace of more than 6 percent during 1994-98. Productivity wntinued to grow in 1999, albeit at a slower pace, increasing by 2 percent in January-November compared with a year earlier. The rapid growth in productivity has been attributed by analysts to a variety of factors, including: l the significant liberalization of the external trade regime beginnning in the late 1980s and the subsequent implementation of various free trade initiatives, most notably NAFTA. These efforts have contributed to greater efficiency by Mexican producers through increased exposure to foreign competition and improved access to imports; l the sharp increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) since 1994, arising in part from NAFTA, has enabled Mexican firms to benefit from technology transfers and rapid productivity gains in other countries, particularly the United States (the main source of FDI flows); and l increased efficiency arising from a comprehensive deregulation program introduced in the early 199Os, efforts to streamline regulations and bureacratic procedures, and the diminished role of the public sector in the economy through privatization. Despite relatively restrictive labor market legislation, Mexico has exhibited a high degree of labour market flexibility since 19!9!5. In this context, total compensation per worker in real terms fell by more than 20 percent during 1995-96 owing to the contraction in domestic demand associated with the 1994- 95 economic crisis. Although real wages have since recovered somewhat, they remain well below pre- crisis levels. The wage restraint and productivity gains have resulted in a near-halving of unit labor costs since 1993 and has contributed to Mexico maintaining its external competitiveness and bouyancy in non- oil exports. During the period January-October 1999, the real effective exchange rate based on relative unit labor costs was over 40 percent more depreciated than in the corresponding period of 1994 (see Figure 3). The share of Mexico’s mauufacturing exports in the United States, its main trading partner, has been steadily increasing, and by 1999 it had reached 16 percent, from about 10 percent in 1994. 18 1 Share of Metian manufacturing exports in U.S. 6 ( , I, ;, I, ;, I, ;, I, ( a I, 1 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public120.0 110.0 100.0 90.0 80.0 70.0 60.0 - 13 - Figure 3.

The spread on Mexican sovereign bonds over U.S. treasury bonds declined markedly, from 800 basis points in January 1999 to 370 basis points in December 1999. In January 2000, the government placed USN l/z billion of IO-year bonds at a spread of 3 15 basis points, the lowest spread since March 1998. Under the government’s debt strategy, which relies on taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce the financing costs of public debt and to achieve a more even maturity profile, the Mexican public sector was able to obtain in 1999 about US$4 billion at better conditions than implied by sovereign spreads through the use of special financing vehicles, such as PEMEX finance. The government was also able to issue in 1999 over US$SOO million of global bonds in exchange for over US$l billion in Brady bonds, freeing up US%400 million in collateral (market value) and reducing the net present value of its future debt-service burden.4 However, although borrowing by the private sector increased in 1999, access remained constrained, reflected in a lower number of issuers and slower convergence of yield spreads relative to pre-crisis levels (a Mexican company issued an equity placement of US$l . 1 billion in early 2000). Private sector external debt declined to 12.9 percent of GDP at end-1999, from 14.2 percent at end-1998, due to a sharp decline in commercial banks’ external debt. 12. The government has adopted important measures to strengthen the operating environment of the banking system and to facilitate the banking system recovery (Attachment I). The definition of regulatory capital has been significantly tightened (beyond that required in the SBA), and will be phased in through end-2002, coinciding with the lifting of the universal deposit guarantee (and replaced by a limited insurance scheme). In addition, loan-loss provisioning of credit card and mortgage loans has been tightened consistent with higher provision levels. Also, the supervisory authorities have made progress in the areas of banks’ internal controls, accounting procedures, disclosure, and anti-money-laundering policies.’ To foster transparency and comparability across institutions, banks will have to disclose specific criteria under which they were granted regulatory forbearance and indicate their impact on financial statements. 3 In early February 2000 Moody’s put Mexico’s credit rating under review for a possible upgrade to investment grade. Standard & Poor’s maintained its current BB rating (two notches below investment grade), with a positive outlook. 4 Details on the government’s debt strategy and special financing operations are provided in Chapter IV of the accompanying Selected Issues paper. ’ As a result of efforts on the part of congress, the Banking Commission, and the Mexican Banking Association, the detection of suspicious banking transactions tripled to 2000 cases in 1999.

The financial fundamentals of the banking system have improved, although the banking system remains undercapitalized. Loan-loss provisioning and regulatory capital have increased, but banks’ cash flows have remained constrained in the context of negative real credit growth and the continued high proportion of problem assets. There also has been significant progress with regard to the activities of IPAB, which is being supported by a World Bank adjustment loan. IPAB has taken important steps to advance the bank restructuring process with preparations underway to sell the large banks Serfin and Bancrecer, which are expected to be concluded in the first half of the year. IPAB also is implementing plans to liquidate its assets (yielding expected proceeds of Mex$20 billion in 2000) according to a specific timetable.6 The mergers of Promex and Athmtico also are expected to take place during the first half of the year. To promote financial intermediation, the authorities have submitted to congress proposals to enhance the legislative framework for bankruptcy proceedings and enforcement of creditors’ collateral rights. 14. The political process is undergoing dramatic changes in the context of the forthcoming presidential elections in July 2000. The major parties have adopted an open procedure for the selection of their respective presidential candidates. In November 1999, the ruling PRI party’s first ever presidential primary took place (substituting for the traditional selection by the incumbent president) in which Francisco Labastida won comfortably.

The 2000 economic program aims at reducing end-period inflation to 10 percent with real GDP growth recovering to 4% percent (maintaining projected economic growth during 1999-2000 around that anticipated in the original program). These real growth and inflation projections are consistent with the February Latin American Consensus Forecast.’ While the political calendar constrains moving ahead with structural reforms in the tax area, the economic program continues to maintain prudent fiscal and monetary policies and emphasizes reforms in the banking sector. 6 According to the 1999 financial sector law, IPAB has three years to sell the assets of intervened banks and five years to sell the assets it acquires from other banks through asset purchases. Within this framework, IPAB has adopted a detailed quarterly asset sale program for 2000. ’ The “consesus forecast” is an average of the forecasts of 17 Mexican and international analysts pooled by the publishers of the document, the Consensus Economics.

In the discussions, the staff stressed that policies should be geared towards safeguarding the favorable economic developments achieved so fkr and resisting pressures to alter the policy stance in view of the rise in the price of oil and the presidential elections later this year. The authorities emphasized their commitment to continue carrying out economic policies consistent with the program’s objectives, and indicated that one of the main legacies of the Zedillo administration would be a smooth, democratic transition to the next I administration within the context of a sustainable strengthening of the economy. 17. The main focus of the discussions was on economic performance and prospective policies under the SBA, with particular attention on the fiscal stance in light of the existing pressures on expenditure. In the f&e of these pressures, the staff found that the authorities’ policy stance remains focused on maintaining macroeconomic stability. In particular, the government’s 2000 budget and the BOM’s monetary program for 2000 are largely consistent with the original economic policy objectives described in the June 1999 Letter of Intent. On this basis, the mission reached agreement with the authorities on the quarterly performance criteria and quantitative indicative targets for end-2000.’ 18. The discussions also focused on progress in restructuring the banking system with particular emphasis on compliance with measures specified in the attached structural matrix, the activities of IPAB, and analysis of bank capitalization. In addition, the staff reviewed the implementation and improvement of the debt monitoring system, and the extension to the reporting of external debt statistics of the private sector, While the staff found that the banking system remains higly undercapitalized, the measures recently taken by the authorities will help improve compliance with international standards. Also, the bulk of structural measures under the SBA are being put in place in line with the program. 19. The authorities are requesting .a waiver for the lower-than-programmed primary surplus in 1999 referred to above. The staff supports this request on the grounds that the authorities are improving further their control mechanisms over the public sector finances. As an indication of these efforts, the 2000 program includes-in addition to the performance criteria and indicative targets included in the 1999 program-indicative quarterly limits on public primary expenditure and on executed privately-financed public in&structure projects. A. Fiscal Policy 20. The fiscal program for 2000 targets an overall deficit of 1 percent of GDP (the same as in the original program) and a primary surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP (0.1 percentage point * The SBA only runs through November 2000. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- of GDP higher than in the original program) (see Table 4).’ As in the 1999 program, the budget provides for saving higher-than-budgeted revenues and cutting expenditures in the case of lower-than-budgeted revenue. The 2000 budget also provides for servicing the full real interest cost on restructured bank debt. About 60 percent of the estimated cost is provided by the budget with the remainder financed by IPAB’s asset sales and bank fees-the 1999 program provided for about half this coverage. lo The 2000 budget assumes an oil price of US$16 a barrel (compared with US$lO a barrel in the original program), with the increased oil-related revenue offset by increased government expenditure, mainly in the social sector.” The resulting non-oil fiscal balance deteriorates by 1 percentage point of GDP compared with the original program. The overall augmented fiscal deficit is projected to decline from 4.8 percent of GDP in 1999 to 3.0 percent of GDP in 2000, partly reflecting lower interest rates. 12 21. Nonfinancial public sector debt at end-2000 is projected to be lower than originally expected reflecting lower external debt (due to a more appreciated exchange rate). Gross bank restructuring and debtor support liabilities increased Corn 2 1.1 percent of GDP at end-l 998 to 22% percent of GDP at end-1999, on account of additional restructuring operations ’ The overall deficit for 2000 is 0.2 percent of GDP higher when valuation gains from a debt buyback operation are excluded Corn cash revenue. lo The 2000 program envisaged budgetary transfers covering the full real interest cost. However, the authorities argued that this financing package achieves the overriding objective of preventing further increases in the real stock of debt. ‘I See Box 3 and Chapter VII of the accompanying selected issues paper for a discussion on social sector policy. l2 The augmented fiscal balance is defined as the overall balance less the capitaliied interest cost of bank restructuring and debtor support operations and the inflation adjustment to the principal on indexed government securities. In an effort to broaden the coverage and transparency of the fiscal accounts, Appendix Table I presents adjusted overall and augmented balances, which also adjust revenue for privatization receipts and unreal&d valuation gains and include direct public investment projects financed and executed by the private sector but whose budgetary impact is not registered until the project is completed and delivered to the government (PIDIREGAS) (Appendix Box 2). The adjusted overall deficit is projected to decline from 6.4 percent of GDP in 1999 to 6.1 percent of GDP in 2000.

MEXICO'SPOVERTYALLEVUTIONSTRATEGY Following the 1994-95 economic crisis, the share of Mexico’s population living in poverty increased Corn 23 percent in 1994 to 29 percent in 1996, reversing most of the gains made since 1984. The increase in poverty was particularly acute in rural areas. The increase in poverty rates was partly attributable to the sizable decline in economic activity following the crisis. While data for assessing the impact on poverty of the recent economic recovery are not yet available, it is likely that poverty has been reduced. World Bank studies, based on Mexican data, indicate that a one percentage point increase in per capita income is associated with a two-thirds percentage point drop in extreme poverty. Nonmonetary measures of well-being have improved substantially. During 1984-96, female labor force participation increased from 34 percent to 41 percent; average family size fell by 9 percent; and the share of workers with secondary education increased from 25 percent to 40 percent. Social expenditure policy l Despite important reductions in Mexico’s primary expenditure, social expenditure (as a percent of GDP and in per-capita terms) has surpassed its pre-crisis levels. l Social sector policy toward the poor has increasingly focused on improving resource allocation through phasing out general subsidies in favor of better targeted social programs, and decentralizing expenditure responsibilities to states and municipalities. l Sensitive to growing urban-rural disparities in living conditions, the government has redefined its poverty alleviation strategy to eradicate extreme poverty in rural areas. Poverty alleviation policy l The cornerstone of the government’s anti-poverty initiative is PROGRESA, the integrated Program for Education, Health, and Nutrition. l The government’s new welfare initiative not only represents a significant break from the traditional pro-urban social policies, but allows much greater scope for families to determine how benefits should be used. l Unlike past anti-poverty programs, which relied on direct provision of goods by public sector entities, the new initiative makes cash transfers conditional upon school attendance and preventive health care guidelines. l The use of statistically rigorous methods to assure objective targeting of transfers, has made the new program less susceptible to local political influences. l Initiated on a pilot basis in 1996, the program’s coverage has been extended from 400,000 households at end-1997, to 2.3 million households at end-1999 (over 70 percent of the extreme poor). l Preliminary studies suggest that PROGRESA has been successful in increasing household consumption and encouraging the demand for schooling and health services. Other Latin American countries are considering following Mexico’s example in the application of , targeted cash transfers to poor rural families.

These liabilities are projected to decline to 22.2 percent of GDP by end-2000, associated with lower interest rates (part of the nominal interest payments are capitalized) and increased financing (including budgetary transfers, asset recovery and deposit insurance fees) to cover the real interest cost on net IPAB liabilities. 22. The 2000 program’s automatic fiscal adjusters have been modified relative to those in the original program, in line with those incorporated in the budget.i3 In the event of lower- than-budgeted revenue the automatic fiscal adjusters have been strengthened relative to the original program, and require that revenue shortfalls in excess of 0.11 percentage point of GDP (instead of 0.21 percentage point of GDP under the original program) be matched by selective expenditure cuts. In the event of higher-than-budgeted revenues, the new automatic fiscal adjusters are not weaker than those in the original program, resulting in lower public debt or contributions to an oil stabilization fund. Figure 4 and Appendix Box 3 compare the new and 1999 program automatic fiscal adjusters. As a result of the automatic adjusters, based on the latest WE0 oil price forecast, the overall fiscal deficit, all else equal, would be about 5’~ percentage point of GDP lower than budgeted (Box 4).i4 23. The staff stressed the need to maintain control over the public finances in 2000 in the context of high oil prices. The authorities emphasized that they are improving further their control mechanisms to ensure that all fiscal targets for 2000 are met. In particular, the automatic budget adjusters in the 2000 program authorize increased public enterprise spending, in the case of higher-than-anticipated enterprise revenue, only if consistent with meeting the overall fiscal objective.” In the case of revenue shortfalls, the government must now send to congress a report detailing the amount and composition of the expenditure adjustment, taking care not to cut social and priority investment projects. Moreover, quarterly revenue projections have been sent to congress for the first time, increasing the transparency and accountability of fiscal policy. r3 The automatic fiscal adjusters under the original program were more comprehensive than those in the 1999 budget, which introduced an inconsistency in the monitoring and implementation between the budget and the program. The adjusters in the SBA were changed to avoid inconsistencies with those included in the 2000 budget. i4 The “all else equal” assumption is critical as, for example, a stronger than assumed value of the peso in 2000 would result in lower peso oil revenues for the same U.S. dollar value. l5 As described in Appendix Box 3, adjusters included in the 1999 budget allowed increased public enterprise spending, in the case of higher-than-anticipated enterprise revenue, without taking into account the overall fiscal objective, which has been corrected for 2000. (The budget adjusters in the 2000 program still do not require public enterprise spending to take into account the program’s fiscal primary balance target.)

THE @‘ISCAL &4l?ACr OF HIGHER OIL PRICES Mexico’s public finances are vuhrerable to oil price fluctuations. During 1990-99, oil revenues averaged close to one-third of total budget revenues (7 percent of GDP), yet were highly volatile. In the 2000 budget, oil revenues are one third of total budgeted revenues. To improve macroeconomic management, the government devised guidelines (though not linked exclusively to oil) in the event that revenues deviate from budgeted amounts (See Appendix Box 3 on automatic adjusters). This box describes the implication of higher-than-budgeted oil prices on fiscal savings. Sources of budgetary oil revenues inclde: the operational balance of the state-owned petroleum company (PEMEX), and the federal government’s receipts from PEMEX in the form of hydrocarbon fees, custom duties, the value-added tax, and excess profit fees. Excess profit fees are levied in case of higher-than-budgeted gains from oil exports, and allow the federal government to appropriate all higher- than-budgeted oil export revenues due to higher-than-budgeted oil prices. In case of higher-than- budgeted oil revenue from domestic sales, the federal government keeps 6 1 percent of the increase and PEMEX keeps the remaining 39 percent. The implication of higher-than-budgeted oil prices for fiscal savings: l Each US%1 a barrel increase in the international oil price is associated with a 0.14 percentage point of GDP increase in oil revenues (domestic sales plus oil exports).’ The increase is distributed between the federal government (which receives about 85 percent) and PEMEX (which receives the rest). Since close to 10 percent of the increase in federal government oil revenues must be shared with subnational governments (according to the fiscal coordination law), the net increase in federal government revenues is 0.11 percentage point of GDP. l Oil revenues are recorded in the fiscal accounts with a two-month lag. Based on the latest WE0 oil price forecast, the average oil price in 2000 will equal US$2 1.7 a barrel. In that event, federal government revenues (net of revenue sharing) would be 0.48 percentage point of GDP higher-than- budgeted. Since the new automatic adjusters limit federal government expenditure expansions to 0.13 percent of GDP, all other things equal, fiscal savings would amount to 0.35 percentage point of GDP.’ ’ The revenue impact of higher oil prices is lower than previously estimated (see EBW99197) on account of (1) lower oil export volumes (due to production cuts agreed with OPEC starting in April 1999); and (2) less-than-expected depreciation of the peso. ’ The WE0 oil forecast for 2000 likely would be associated with a lower-than-assumed depreciation of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar; this in turn would lower the magnitude of fiscal savings (oil revenue in pesos would be lower). See Appendix Box 3 for a description of the mechanisms for limiting the authorization of expenditure expansion.

The staff also raised concerns about the procyclical nature of focal policy and its potential for increasing pressure on aggregate demand, in the context of the deterioration in the non-oil fiscal balance. The authorities explained that fiscal policy is largely set to achieve medium-term objectives, while monetary policy is the appropriate instrument for fine-tuning the economy in the context of the flexible exchange rate system. They also stressed that the underlying medium-term fiscal objectives had not been loosened in the face of the increased costs of social security and banking sector reform. Nevertheless, they indicated that they stand ready to tighten fiscal policy (through cuts in nonpriority investment expenditures) should pressures on domestic demand increase to unsustainable levels. 25. The staff attaches considerable importance to the authorities’ commitment to contain expenditure growth and to avoid frontloading outlays (in the first half of the year) in the run-up to the presidential elections. In this context, underlying noninterest expenditure (after excluding the cost of social security and banking sector reform) as a share of GDP, while higher-than-originally programmed, is projected to fall to the lowest level in over a decade during 1999-2000. Also, even after accounting for election- and census- related expenditure, less than half of noninterest expenditure is programmed to take place in the first half of 2000. 26. As part of the 2000 budget, additional measures have been introduced aimed at improving the efliciency of the tax system. Stricter limits have been imposed on the consolidation of corporate losses, asset depreciation rules have been tightened, and additional powers have been granted to the tax authority to crack down on tax evaders. On the VAT, the tax base has been widened to include services from the transportation of goods and the scheme for allocating tax credits has been strengthened. Notwithstanding these measures, non-oil tax revenue is expected to decline by 0.2 percent of GDP in 2000 on account of (1) the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 32 percent to 30 percent (as envisaged in the original program); (2) the implementation of a new Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union (EU), expected July 2000 (see paragraph 45);16 and (3) the tax exemption of interest income from long-term securities (with maturity in excess of three years). These measures will more than offset the revenue gain from increases in the excise tax on tobacco products (from 85 percent to 100 percent) (Appendix Table III). 27. The authorities are also in the process of devising a comprehensive tax reform aimed at further broadening the tax base through, inter alia, eliminating the VAT zero-rating for most domestic transactions, reducing the number of special regimes and exemptions that apply to firms in the agriculture, fishery, and transportation sectors, and expanding the personal income tax base to include fringe benefits. In this regard, a dialogue with the private sector is currently underway aimed at creating a consensus that would facilitate submission of a reform bill after the July 2000 presidential elections. l6 Extending the dismantling of extraordinary custom duties imposed on non-FTA, non-EU countries would reduce revenue by less than an additional 0.1 percent of GDP.

The privatization program for 2000 is more ambitious than originally programmed (at 0.7 percent of GDP, budgeted revenue is 0.4 percentage point of GDP higher). The privatization of regional airports and railroads is now coming on stream after experiencing some delays in 1999, and plans are well underway to recover assets from restructured development banks, and publicly offer for sale government shares in an insurance company and in a commercial bank. Administered prices of gasoline and diesel, and electricity tariffs on agricultural and residential consumers will increase monthly in line with projected inflation. ” Progress in establishing a timetable for the elimination of electricity tar%’ subsidies has been postponed due to political difficulties in reforming the electricity sector. 29. Revenue sharing (between local and federal levels) and expenditure responsibilities of subnational governments have been broadened finther as part of the government’s efforts to expand political participation and enhance fiscal efficiency. Subnational expenditure is expected to increase by 6 percent in real terms in 2000 to the equivalent of 36 percent of nonfinancial public sector primary expenditure. During 2000, hard budget constraints on federal government transfers to subnational entities will be imposed and the transparency and efficiency of decentralized expenditures will be increased. The reforms- which are being supported by a World Bank Decentralization Adjustment Loan @AL,)-will end most discretionary transfers to subnational entities, and implement performance agreements in the health and environment sectors. In addition, commercial and development bank regulation will be altered (loans guaranteed by the federal government will be phased out) to promote sounder risk assessments of subnational government loans. To help banks assess the credit risk of state and municipal governments, new loans will be rated by independent credit agencies.” Finally, improvements in the efficiency of government expenditures will be supported by important progress (at the federal level) in the modemization of the treasury and implementation of a new budget management system (see Attachment I). I7 Currently, Mexican retail gasoline and diesel prices are about 25 percent higher than the equivalent U.S. retail price. I8 States have traditionally relied on bank lending (primarily from BANOBRAS, a federal development bank) to finance their borrowing requirements. The Mexican constitution prohibits states from borrowing in foreign exchange or from foreign creditors, and a domestic market for subnational debt does not exist. As of end-1998, subnational debt as a share of GDP was less than 2 percent, down from 4 percent in 1994. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - B. Monetary and Exchange Bate Policy 30. Monetary policy aims at achieving the inflation and external objectives of the program. The 2000 monetary program establishes a limit on the growth of net domestic assets of the BOM and a floor on net international reserves equivalent to the level at end-1999 (see Table 5)” The implementation of monetary policy will continue to be pursued within the context of the existing floating exchange rate regime, with intervention in the exchange market limited to rule-based mechanisms.*’ The BOM recognizes that it will have to remain vigilant to reach the inflation objective by maintaining a nonaccommodative bias, stressing that it is ready to adjust monetary policy to offset fully the indirect effects of adverse exogenous shocks to the domestic price level and at least partially offset direct inflationary pressures. In that regard, the BOM tightened monetary policy preemptively in January 2000 amid incipient price pressure in some selected food items. 31. While acknowledging the BOM’s track record of tightening monetary policy as needed to reach program objectives, the staff expressed concern about the significant expansion of the monetary base since September 1999 (even after taking into account Y2K-related liquidity) and the assumption of some further decline in monetary base velocity in the 2000 monetary program. The staff indicated that this monetary expansion, accompanied by recent declines in real interest rates, may create monetary conditions that are more susceptible to sudden adverse shifis in sentiment. The authorities stressed that recent monetary developments are consistent with the projected continued decline in inflation; the acceleration in the growth of base money reflects a decline in the opportunity cost of holding money balances in line with reduced inflation expectations. 32. The BOM stressed that the inflation objective for 2000 is framed in the medium-term context of reducing inflation to the level of its main trading partners by 2003. The BOM reaffirmed its policy of gradually shifting away from the use of monetary aggregates as an intermediate target and toward implementing a policy of inflation targeting. This will require increased transparency and accountability of policy conduct, with the announcement of multiperiod targets and a clear description of the monetary policy reaction to adverse shocks. The BOM views inflation targeting as a signaling device to frame the disinflation process and strengthen the autonomy of the BOM in fighting inflation. The BOM has announced that it will start publishing a quarterly inflation report to enhance the transparency and accountability of monetary policy. lg The original program targeted a US$l billion increase in NIB in 2000. The new target for 2000 takes into account the large increase in NR in 1999 (compared with a target of no change). *’ See EBS/99/97 (6/18/99) Box 2 for a description of the rule-based mechanisms.

The staff also expressed concern about the continued disinter-mediation of the banking system which, with an increasing proportion of financial activity taking place outside the control of the BOM, could reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy and the ability to supervise credit and foreign exchange transactions. The authorities emphasized that the ongoing efforts to strengthen the banking system, and the anticipated passage of the banking system legislation before congress, should foster bank credit intermediation. They also noted the effectiveness of monetary policy in mitigating the impact of the recent crisis on financial markets. C. Banking System 34. Notwithstanding the important progress during the last few years in stabilizing and reforming the banking system, it remains fragile. Measured in terms of international best practices, the system is highly undercapitalized. This situation reflects widespread regulatory forbearance and insufficiently tight asset valuation rules for the banks. The finances of individual banks are divergent, with some of the large banks in markedly weaker capital positions than others. 35. Against this background, the staff encouraged the authorities to consider ways of strengthening the soundness of commercial banks. However, the authorities indicated that the financial condition of the banking system is sufficient to allow for a gradual convergence towards financial soundness, especially after considering the actions recently taken to strengthen the regulatory framework and the operations of IPAB. 36. In this context, the notes issued by FOBAPROA held by the banks will soon be exchanged for IPAB notes (as described below). As a condition for the bond swap, banks are required to submit detailed financial consolidation plans to IPAB. While these plans are not legally binding documents, the staff encouraged the authorities to use these plans as guidelines for banks’ compliance with the new standards and regulations. The staff noted that for some banks reaching these guidelines till require significant increases in capital, while recommending that banks should aim to be fully capitalized in advance of the date when limited coverage of all bank deposits will come into effect (January 1,2003). These efforts will be aided by the authorities’ plan to adopt new classification and provisioning regulations for commercial loans by mid-year. Finally, a number of further improvements were suggested to bring the new prudential regulations more in line with international best practices (Box 5). 37. The 2000 budget granted IPAB the ability to refinance its liabilities. IPAB will issue three-year floating rate notes linked to the 28-day treasury bills (cetes) and use the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - Box 5. SUGGESTED MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN PRUDENTIAL REGIJLATIONS The measures implemented recently by the authorities improve the regulatory regime in the areas of bank capital requirements and loan classification and provisioning standards. However, the staff strongly encourages the authorities to implement the following changes in order to bring the new regulations even closer to international best practices. New capital regulations l Shorten the transitory period for introduction of the new capital requirements; banks should be in compliance well ahead of January 1,2003, when the first substantial reduction of deposit insurance is scheduled to take place. l Require banks to disclose not only the extent of forbearance arising from bank-specific measures, but also the extent of forbearance arising from system-wide arrangements. l Adopt more conservative rules for valuation and recognition of deferred tax assets. This would reduce significantly the current share of deferred taxes in bank capital. l Do not count provisions for credit card loans (classified as B, C, or D and thus specific in nature, see below) as part of tier-II capital (supplementary capital). Loan classification and provisioning requirements l Treat loan-loss provisions related to credit carsl loans classified as B, C, or D as specific provisions (not as general provisions), as they replace provisions established against losses identified on a loan-by-loan basis. ’ l Increase the minimum provision (currently % percent) for credit card loans. l Tighten the reclassification of credit card loans as “standard,” in line with international best practices. l Calculate loan-loss provisions for mortgage loans on the basis of the full value of the loan and not on the basis of the unsecured value of the loan only. l Eliminate the limit on the amount of specific provisions that can be deducted from taxable income in any given year. ’ The CNBV (National Banking and Securities Commission) considers that provisions determined on the basis of a formula are to be treated as general provisions; however, this does not agree with the criteria set forward in “Sound Practices for Loan Accounting and Disclosure,” issued by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision in July 1999.

The refinancing of IPAB liabilities also will help restore banks’ cash flow position and smooth the maturity profile of IPAB’s sizable obligations. To help ensure orderly market conditions, the BOM has been designated to act as agent and the new IPAB securities will assume the same seniority as federal government debt. In addition, to facilitate placement, the government will abstain from issuing securities with terms similar to those to be issued by IPAB (Appendix Box 4). The staffwelcomed these steps and encouraged the authorities to grant IPAJ3 the capacity to refinance its liabilities on a more permanent basis (rather than on a yearly basis through the budgetary process). 38. The authorities have taken significant steps aimed at improving the legal framework of the banking system, including the proposed reform of the laws on collateral and bankruptcy recently submitted to congress. The authorities recognize that once approved, the effective implementation of the proposed legislation will require support of the judiciary and are studying measures to address prevailing institutional weaknesses, To support the bank restructuring efforts, the staff also reiterated the importance of introducing a requirement that banks under financial distress take specific measures to restore financial soundness (prompt corrective action). Finally, to enhance the quality of the supervisory fimction, Fund staff concurred with the authorities about the significance of ensuring the independence of the supervisory authority and granting legal protection to supervisors in the discharge of their duties.= D. Balance of Payments and External Financing in 2000 39. The external current account deficit is projected to widen to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2000, as stronger import growth and higher international interest rates would more than offset the impact of higher non-oil export growth and oil prices (see Table 6). Oil exports are projected to be unchanged from 1999, as a small decrease in export volume would offset the *’ During 2000, IPAB is expected to place around Mex$70 billion (equivalent to 15 percent of the stock of domestic federal government debt outstanding at end- 1999 and about 10 percent of IPAB’s net liabilities). ** A legislative proposal to transfer the CNBV (the Banking Commission) from the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit to the Bank of Mexico has remained stalled in congress since March 1998.

Strong domestic demand should increase import volume growth to 13.1 percent (from 11.3 percent in 1999); an increase in unit prices would fbrther raise the growth of imports in U. S. dollar terms to 15.1 percent, from 10.7 percent in 1999. 40. Foreign direct investment is projected to be roughly unchanged in 2000, continuing to be the main source of financing for the current account deficit. Access to international capital markets is expected to continue to improve. Foreign investors have been showing an increasing interest in sovereign Mexican debt issues, and the government intends to take advantage of the current good market conditions to satisfy all its 2000 gross financing needs early in the year. Borrowing in the remainder of the year would be limited to continuing to take advantage of market opportunities under the government’s debt strategy of reducing the financing costs of Mexico’s public debt and achieving a smooth, lengthened maturity profile. It is assumed that in 2000 (i) the rollover rate of bank credits will recover from the relatively low level of 1999 (to average 100 percent); and, (ii) gross external borrowing by corporate issuers will decline by about 5 percent, due to election year uncertainties. 41. Overall, available external financing would be sufficient to cover Mexico’s gross financing needs, which are projected to decline to US$63 billion in 2000, from US$67 billion in 1999, as lower arnortization of public sector debt will more than compensate for the increase in the current account deficit (Appendix Table IV). Gross international reserves at end-2000 will be roughly unchanged Corn end- 1999, and would reach the equivalent of 2.8 months of next year’s imports of goods and services, 73 percent of short-term debt by remaining maturity, and about half of the projected gross financing needs in 200 1. 42. Net payments to official creditors (including the Fund) are projected at US$O.4 billion, while net capital inflows from private creditors are projected to decrease slightly, from US% 18 billion to US% 16.9 billion, mostly due to a decline in the financing needs of the public sector. Total external debt would decline from 33 percent of GDP at end-1999 to 3 1 percent of GDP by end-2000, with public external debt accounting for most of the decline. Private sector debt will decline by ‘/s percentage point in 2000 to 12.7 percent of GDP, as commercial banks are projected to maintain their external borrowing in U.S. dollar terms at the end- 1999 level. Short-term external debt is projected to decline Corn 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent of GDP. 23 The balance of payments projections are based on an average oil price of US$l6 per barrel in 2000, consistent with the fiscal projections. At the projected export level of 1% million barrels per day, the projected annual average WE0 price of oil (of US!§2 1.2 per barrel) wotild increase exports by US$2.9 billion (% percent of GDP).

To aid in the assessment of external vulnerability, the authorities have been improving private sector external debt statistics, in line with program commitments. Important progress has been made regarding (1) increasing the frequency of reporting under the monitoring system of interbank foreign credit lines, put in place by the BOM in collaboration with Fund staff in late 1998 (see Appendix Box 1); (2) publicly traded companies are now required to report comprehensive information on their external liabilities in their quarterly report to the Mexican stock exchange; and (3) external debt service projections for commercial banks now are being produced by the BOM. 44. During the discussions, the staff suggested that the SBA be treated as precautionary, in light of the more favorable external environment and the strengthening of the balance of payments. The authorities stressed the need for further purchases under the SBA at least through the first half of 2000 to reinforce the country’s gross international position and alleviate market concerns in the period leading up to the presidential elections in July 2000. E. Trade Policy 45. Mexico has continued to implement its trade liberalization strategy focused on the negotiation of bilateral trade agreements. Mexico is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA, with Canada and the United States), and a member of the G-3 (with Colombia and Venezuela), and has bilateral agreements with Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. In November 1999, Mexico concluded the negotiations on a free trade agreement (FTA) with the European Union (Box 6). The agreement will be effective as soon as it is ratified by both parties, which should occur before July 2000. In February 2000, Mexico concluded negotiations on a FTA with Israel. Upon entry into force of the FTAs with the EU and with Israel, 9 1 percent of Mexico’s external trade (95 percent of exports and 87 percent of imports) will be conducted with countries with FTAs. 46. Mexico’s trade regime is free of prohibitions and restrictive licensing on virtually all items, except for health, environmental, or security reasons. Tariff increases on non-FTA imports included in the 1999 budget raised the unweighted average external tariff to 16.1 percent as of July 1999, from 13.2 percent at end-1998.24 The authorities have explained that this measure is temporary and was adopted for fiscal reasons, and plan to reverse it in 2000 if fiscal revenues are higher than budgeted. The government has continued to monitor the dumping of goods in the Mexican market. During 1999,30 new antidumping measures . 24 These figures, however, exclude the effects of Mexico’s existing regional and bilateral trade agreements. The weighted average external tariff including the effect of FTAs was 2.9 percent as at July 1999, up from 2.6 percent as’ at end-l 998.

MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION On November 25, 1999, technical negotiations were concluded on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Mexico and the European Union (Ev). The FTA is comprehensive, covering market access for goods, technical standards, sanitary and phitosanitary measures, rules of origin, government procurement, trade in services, intellectual property rights, competition policy, foreign investment, safeguards, and dispute settlement mechanisms. The agreement is expected to become effective in July 2000, after ratification by the Mexican senate and by the European Council of Ministers. Trade in goods l The EU accounts for about 4 percent of Mexico’s exports and 9 percent of its imports of goods, with industrial products accounting for about 93 percent of total bilateral trade. l The FTA eliminates quantitative restrictions to trade, and establishes a linear reduction of tariffs from 1998 levels (which for Mexico means that the extraordinary tariffs introduced in the 1999 budget will be eliminated on imports from the EU, from the date of the FTA’s entry into force), until fill elimination of tariffs on industrial goods by 2007, and on most agricultural goods by 20 10. l Schedule for elimination of tarifI% on industrial goods: EU-82 percent of imports upon entry into force, and remainder by 2003; Mexic&S percent of imports upon entry into force, 5 percent by 2003, 6 percent by 2005, and the remainder by 2007. l Schedule for elimination of tariffs on agricultural goods: EU-58 percent of imports upon entry into force, 10 percent by 2003, 5 percent by 2008, and 1 percent by 2010; Mexico-28 percent of imports upon entry into force, 10 percent by 2003, 8 percent by 2008, and 4 percent by 2010; free market access for the remainder to be the subject of future discussions. ’ Other areas covered by the FTA ’ The effect of the FTA on other areas will be more limited. Mexico already has seven bilateral investment treaties with EU member countries, and the FTA encourages the establishment of similar treaties with the remaining countries. On public sector procurement, the FTA provides Mexico with preferential treatment, and the EU with the same access as Mexico’s NAFTA partners. Similar $nciples apply to trade in services, through a stand-still provision on current restrictions until a new round of negotiations, which should take place in three years. Finally, the FTA provides for the establishment of a special committee that will address questions related to the effective enforcement of existing local regulations on competition policy and intellectual property.

While the authorities noted that these measures are consistent with WTO provisions and were not used as a protectionist device, the St&urged a cautious use of these measures consistent with a transparent and open trading system. F. Medium-Term Framework and Capacity to Repay 47. The medium-term outlook remains broadly unchanged Corn that discussed in the context of approval of the current SBA (EBS/99/97) (Table 8). Under the current scenario, oil prices would decline somewhat during 2001-02 and remain broadly constant in real terms thereafter, in line with the latest WE0 forecast. On the assumption of continued implementation of strong macroeconomic policies and a finther deepening of structural reforms, the overall public sector would improve to a balanced position by 2005, which would contribute to a further reduction in real interest rates. The lower deficits would be largely financed by external resources, thus helping to provide ample domestic credit resources to the private sector as economic growth accelerates tirther and in the context of the envisaged issuance of large amounts of negotiable IPAB debt during the period. It is fiu-ther assumed that the improvement in private savings seen since 1998 would continue, consistent with the improvement in real income. 48. On this basis, the external current account deficit would be contained to below 4 percent of GDP over the medium term, which should be financeable in the absence of major external shocks through foreign direct investment and other long-term capital (Table 9). The projections assume a constant real exchange rate Corn end-1999. The growth of non-oil exports (ii volume terms) is projected to fall to an average of 11 percent a year in 2001-05, compared with 16 percent in 1996-99. Import volume growth is projected to decrease Corn an average of 19 percent in 1996-99 to an average of 10 percent a year in 2001-05.25 49. Under the baseline scenario total external debt would decline Corn 33 percent of GDP at end-1999 to 28% percent of GDP by end-2005, with public sector debt declining from 20 percent to 16 percent of GDP (Table 10). In addition, public sector external debt service is projected to decline from 22% percent of exports of goods and services and transfers in 1999, to 10% percent in 2005. 25 With current oil prices the fiscal and external current account balances would improve, and capital inflows could be higher (relative to the baseline scenario), contributing to a substantial increase in net international reserves. Nevertheless under such a scenario it is likely that the exchange rate would depreciate by less than projected, which would temper the improved fiscal position (oil revenues in pesos would be lower) and external current account position (imports would be higher and non-oil exports could be somewhat lower). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - 50. The medium-term baseline scenario is based on a conservative oil price, consistent with the US$16 a barrel projected for 2000. Assuming that the relationship observed in 1999 between the average price of the Mexican oil basket and the average price of the WE0 oil basket is maintained over the medium term, under WE0 forecasts oil prices would be on average US$l ‘/ a barrel higher than in the baseline scenario. In the 2000-05 period, an increase in the oil price of US$l per barrel would increase exports by about US$600 million per year, on average. The baseline scenario also assumes that international interest rates would be unchanged from end-2000 levels. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would widen the external current account deficit by about US%750 million a year (0.1 percent of GDP), on average. 26 51. Total debt service to the Fund (equivalent to 90 percent of quota) in 2000 would represent 10 percent of total debt service due, 10 percent of gross reserves, and 3 percent of exports of goods and services. If all purchases under the SBA are made as scheduled, these ratios would decline, thereafter, to reach the equivalent of 2% percent of total debt service due and 0.6 percent of exports of goods and services, on average, during 2001-05 (Table 11). In the staffs view, based on past payment performance, assuming that macroeconomic and structural policies will be implemented as envisaged, and in the absence of major adverse external shocks, Mexico should be able to discharge these obligations to the Fund in a timely manner. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 52. Economic performance in 1999 and early in 2000 has been good, aided by improved international capital market conditions and higher oil prices. Economic activity recovered from the deceleration that took place toward the end of 1998, driven initially by higher exports and investment, but more recently by a significant rebound in private consumption. In addition, inflation declined somewhat below the program target of 13 percent. Strong import growth associated with a recovery in domestic demand led to a higher-than-expected external current account deficit, which was fully covered by private sector capital inflows, mainly foreign direct investment, and net international reserves grew strongly. An improvement in labor productivity and wage restraint have contributed to Mexico maintaining its external competitiveness, as indicated by the level of the real effective exchange rate based on relative unit labor costs and the buoyancy in non-oil exports. 53. Macroeconomic polices during 1999 were in line with the program, and all except one quantitative performance criteria under the SBA were met, in some cases with large margins. 26 See EBS/99/97 (6/18/99) for a more comprehensive medium-term sensitivity analysis, including an analysis of the impact of higher import growth and of lower real GDP growth in the United States (it is estimated that a ‘/z percent drop in the U.S. real GDP growth rate would reduce the growth rate of Mexican exports by about 1 percent). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33 - The overall fiscal deficit was below the program limit of 1% percent of GDP; however, the fiscal primary surplus was somewhat lower than programmed reflecting lower nontax revenue and higher public sector enterprise expenditure. The Bank of Mexico maintained its strong commitment during the year to meet the inflation objective. 54. The authorities’ strong commitment to resist pressures to alter the policy stance in view of the rise in the price of oil and the presidential elections later this year and to continue carrying out economic policies that are consistent with their program objectives is welcome. Their intention to ensure that the current administration achieves a smooth, democratic transition to the next administration within the context of a sustainable strengthening of the economy is of paramount importance, and would signal a major departure from the past. 55. The staff supports granting the authorities’ request for a waiver for the nonobservance of the end-December performance criterion on the public sector primary surplus on the grounds that the deviation is small, the overall fiscal objective was obtained, and that the authorities are improving further their control mechanisms over the public sector finances to ensure that all fiscal targets for 2000 are met, including through careful monitoring of public enterprise expenditure and providing quarterly revenue projections to congress. In this regard, the stafF welcomes the authorities’ intention to maintain control over public expenditure in the run-up to the elections in the context of the recent rise in the price of oil, and not to spend resources placed in the oil stabilization fimd during the budget year. The authorities are encouraged to devise transparent rules for this fund’s operations. 56. At the center of the authorities’ economic program for 2000 is a programmed overall fiscal deficit of 1 percent of GDP, the same as in the original program. The 2000 budget continues to provide for saving higher-than-budgeted revenue and cutting expenditure in the case of lower-than-budgeted revenue; it also provides for servicing the full real interest cost of restructured bank debt. In the context of the budgeted deterioration in the non-oil fiscal balance, the staff urges caution about the procyclical fiscal policy stance; in this regard, the authorities’ intention to stand ready to tighten fiscal policy through cuts in nonpriority investment, should pressures on domestic demand increase to unsustainable levels, is welcome. 57. The authorities have taken additional actions aimed at improving the efficiency of the tax system. They are also in the process of devising a comprehensive tax reform aimed primarily at broadening the VAT base to reduce the budget’s dependency on oil-related revenues. In this regard, it is important that the present dialogue with the private sector succeeds at creating a consensus that would facilitate submission of a reform bill after the presidential elections. 58. The government has adopted measures to strengthen the banking system by streamlining loan-loss classification and provisioning regulations as well as tightening the definition of regulatory capital (beyond that required in the original program). Notwithstanding these important reforms, the banking system remains fragile and, when Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - measured in terms of best international practices, is highly undercapitalized. In this regard, the staff encourages the authorities to take the measures needed to ensure that banks comply with the new capital regulations, using the banks’ consolidation plans as a guideline for compliance with the new standards and regulations, and urges a further modification of the new prudential regulations more in line with international best practices. 59. The staRgives great importance to the authorities’ plans to develop rapidly a market for IPAB’s securities, including by IPAB issuing soon three-year adjustable rate notes and by enhancing the terms of IPAB securities already held by banks to facilitate the restructuring of this sizable debt, and urges that all needed steps are taken to ensure that bank restructuring operations and IPAB asset sales take place as scheduled. The staff welcomes the authorization in the 2000 budget that enables IPAB’s securities to have the same seniority as federal government securities and encourages the authorities to grant IPAB the capacity to refinance its liabilities on a more permanent basis. 60. The legislation submitted to congress to enhance bankruptcy procedures and enforcement of creditors’ rights is critical to strengthening further the banking system and facilitating financial intermediation. To support the banks’ restructuring efforts, the staff recommends introducing legislation that requires banks to take prompt corrective action in circumstances of bank’s distress. Finally, the staff supports the authorities’ efforts to pass legislation that ensures greater autonomy of the supervisory authority. 61. The Bank of Mexico will continue to implement monetary policy within the context of the existing floating exchange rate system. Its policy stance continues to seek to counteract not only the secondary effects of adverse shocks but also, at times, to partially compensate for, the direct inflationary effects. The tightening of monetary policy preemptively in January 2000 amid incipient price pressures is a further indication of the Bank of Mexico’s commitment to reduce inflation. Nevertheless, the significant expansion of the monetary base since September 1999 (even after taking into account the Y2K effect) is worrisome. While acknowledging that these trends are consistent with reduced inflationary expectations, the recent rapid monetary expansion potentially makes the economy more susceptible to sudden adverse shifts in market sentiment. Finally, the staRsupports the Bank of Mexico’s policy of gradually shifting away from the use of monetary aggregates as an intermediate target and toward implementing a policy of inflation targeting, which should aid in reaching the objective of reducing inflation to the level of its main trading partners by 2003. 62. The authorities have made good progress in implementing the structural reform measures established under the program. All the fiscal and external debt policy measures have been implemented according to or ahead of schedule. While there have been some delays in implementing some aspects of the banking system reform, the staff‘s encouraged by the authorities’ intention to implement the pending measures in the near future. The staffurges the authorities to eliminate soon the extraordinary tariff on non-FTA imports introduced in the 1999 budget, in light of its negligible fiscal impact, and of the potential costs in terms of distortions to trade flows.

At budgeted oil prices, the external current account deficit is expected to increase moderately in 2000 in line with improved economic and financial conditions, although at WE0 projected prices the deficit could narrow. External financing needs are expected to be met by net inflows to the public sector as well as to the private sector, including sizable foreign direct investment. The authorities’ prudent debt management strategy should enable a manageable medium-term external debt profile, providing a safeguard against potential variations in the external environment. In this regard, while capital inflows could even be larger than projected (in the context of a smooth political transition and further credit rating upgrades), the staff commends the authorities on the continuing improvements that have been put in place to the early warning monitoring system established in collaboration with Fund staff. 64. In sum, the staff supports the completion of the first and second reviews under the SBA and it is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Mexico be held on the standard 1Zmonth cycle.

HIGH FREQUENCY MONITORING SYSTEM FOR INTERBANK FOREIGN CREDIT LINES The BOM maintains a high frequency monitoring system of commercial bank external debt. The key elements of the system are (1) an early warning indicator @WI) for shifts in conditions of access to foreign inter-bank credit lines, which is positively related to higher average interest rate spreads and to lower average maturities of credit lines; and (2) the tracking of rollover rates of inter-bank credit lines (see EBS/99/97, page 24, Box 5, for more details). The system has been recently improved with the increase in the frequency of reporting of rollover rates and interest rate spreads from a monthly to a weekly basis. During most of 1999, rollover rates were below 100 percent, and the stock of external credit lines declined by about US$2% billion, with European banks maintaining, on average, a higher rollover rate than U.S. banks. However, access improved substantially, as shown by the decline in the EWI from 126 to 44 points in the year to December 1999, reflecting a substantial narrowing of interest rate spreads (by about 60 basis points), and some increase in average maturity. The improvement in terms suggests that the reduction in credit lines is not attributable to adverse market conditions, but to a voluntary reduction in the Mexican banks’ foreign exchange exposure amid a continued decline in domestic credit and increasingly favorable funding costs in Mexican pesos.

As the name suggests, the scheme has allowed the nrblic sector to carry out public investment projects, while deferring its impact on the fiscal tccounts until after the project is completed. Each year congress authorizes new projects, which tre determined to be strategic and highly profitable (with returns that more than cover future lebt-setice costs). From the pool of authorized projects (past and present), a private sector firm :xecutes a new or existing project (contracts are granted through an open public biddiig process). lhere are two types of projects: 1 Direct investment projects, which are built and financed by the private sector and upon completion the ownership is transferred to the public sector in exchange for full payment. Payments are made by the offshore subsidiary of the public enterprise (PEMEX Mastertrust or CFE) that then charges PEMEX or CFE an annuity which covers debt-service costs. p Conditional investment projects, which are built, financed, owned, and operated by the private sector and for which the government assumes the obligation to purchase the services provided by such projects (mostly in the electricity sector). The public sector will be responsible for the liabilities associated with the project if the public sector fails to make payments for agreed services or in the case of force majeure. Recording of PIDIREGAS operations in fiscal accounts b Budget recording of direct investmentprojects. The budget records the annuity paid by PEMEX or CFE to the offshore vehicle. The annuity’s amortization component is recorded as public sector investment (the year in which the payment is made) and the interest component as interest expenditure. According to the GFS, executed direct investment projects should be recorded in the fiscal accounts as public investment and interest on the accumulated liabilities as interest expenditure. Application of GFS standards would imply an increase in the public sector deficit of about 1.3 percent of GDP in 1999 and 1.6 percent of GDP in 2000. ) Budget recording of conditional iPlvesttnent projects. The budget records the cost of the services provided without a lag and in line with GFS standards. D Public debt statistics. Debt statistics record the amortization component of the annuity falling due the next year (USS78 million at end-1999). GFS standards would require that total direct investment liabilities be recorded as public debt.

COMPARIS~NOFFISCALADJUSTERSINTHE~~~~BUDGETWITHTHE 1999PIuxRAM Since 1998, the Mexican budget has contained specific provisions requiring fEcal savings in the event of higher-than-budgeted revenues, and expenditure cuts in the event of revenue shortfalls (revenue targets are reviewed on a quarterly basis). The 2000 budget modified these automatic adjusters. This box and Figure 4 compare the fiscal adjusters in the 2000 budget with those in the 1999 program. In the event of lower-than-budgeted revenues, the new fiscal adjusters are triggered sooner relative to the 1999 program. Shortfalls in overall revenue in excess of 1 percent of tax revenue (the annual equivalent of 0.11 percent of GDP) must be matched with selective expenditure cuts. The 1999 program required expenditure cuts when revenue shortfalls exceeded the annual equivalent of 0.21 percent of GDP. Expenditure cuts must avoid social and priority investment projects. Should revenue shortfalls exceed the equivalent of 5 percent of tax revenue, congress has up to 10 days to suggest changes to the executive branch’s proposal. The executive branch has full discretion whether to incorporate the proposed changes. In the event of higher-than-budgeted revenues, the new fiscal adjusters on balance are not weaker than those in the 1999 program. In particular, while under the new fiscal adjusters, limits on expenditure expansion are more restrictive, these adjusters apply to a narrower concept of revenue. To illustrate this point, several scenarios are described below: l In the event of higher-than-budgeted public enterprise revenue, enterprises are authorized to spend more, if consistent with the annual overall fiscal balance objective. In the 1999 program, expenditure expansions were capped at 0.21 percentage point of GDP. In principle, no such cap exists under the new adjuster. l In the event of higher-than-budgeted federal government revenue (net of associated increases in revenue sharing with subnational governments), the new adjusters authorize expenditure increases equivalent to 0.13 percent of GDP compared with 0.2 1 percent of GDP of overall revenue under the 1999 program. Another difference with the 1999 program, where all savings had to be used to amortize debt, is that the new automatic adjusters require that 40 percent of the savings (regardless of source) goes to an oil stabilization fund, and the remaining 60 percent goes to amortize debt. The authorities have committed not to spend the resources allocated to the fund during the budget year. The legal and operational rules guiding the oil stabilization f&d will be defined in the coming months. Lastly, fiscal savings under both adjusters are compared in the very likely event of higher-than- budgeted oil prices. Assuming an outcome in line with the latest WE0 oil price forecast, the fiscal savings under the new adjusters are only slightly lower (0.1 percentage point of GDP) than in the 1999 program.

BANKRESTFW CTURINGANDDEBTORSUPP~RTLIABILITIES The devaluation of the Mexican peso in December 1994, accompanied by a sharp increase in interest rates, rising intlatioq and au acute economic recession, severely affected the financial fimdamenth of the banking system amid a sub&&al deterioration of assets and a rapid erosion of capital. To contain systemic bank risk and preserve the payments system, the govemment and FOBAPROA (succeeded in March 1999 by IPAB) have provided direct support and liquidity facilities for banks and assistance for severely impaired selected debtor groups. The liabilities incur& will be amortized over a period of up to 30 years with the bank restructuring and inflation indexed units (UDI) programs maturing over the medium to long term and the bank recapitalization program maturing in 2005-06. The main operations comprise: Operations Bunk restructuring: Intervention and partial liquidation, Liability December 1999 Mex$ Percent billion of GDP 668.4 14.5 pledged assets, direct deposit liabilities from-intervened institutions, loans from Bank of Mexico and NAFIN Bank recapitalizution: Loan purchase in exchange of bank recapitaliiation Debtor support: Conversion of loans into investment units (UDI) against issuance of Cetes Especiales, loan discount programs for selected debtor groups (ADE, FOPYME, FINAPE, Punto Final) Toll road support Total bank restructuring and debtor support operations Of which Assume!d by IPAB Already paid operations’ Gross fiscal cost IPAB assets ‘*’ Deposit insuran ce fee income (net present value)lJ Net fiscpl c>d ~~~ 156.6 3.4 193.4 4.2 20.1 0.4 1,038.7 22.5 844.2 18.3 140.9 3.0 1,179.5 25.5 206.0 4.5 102.8 2.2 870.7 18.8 Sources: The Bank Savings Protection Institute (IPAEI); and Fund statT estimates. ’ As of June 1999. ’ Assuming a 20 percent asset recovery rate. 3 Corresponds to three-fourths of fees paid by banks. Total net fiscal cost increased from 14.3 percent of GDP at end-1997 (SM 98/208) to an estimated 18.8 percent of GDP at end-1999 owing to a downward revision in the asset recovery rate (previously 30 percent), additional support operations, and the accumulation of interest on liabilities. A 1 percentage point decline in the rate of asset recovery would increase the net fiscal cost by 0.2 percent of GDP.

The CAS envisages a lending program of US$5.2 billion between FY 1999-2001, of which US$1.9 billion in quick disbursing adjustment lending. Given the political transition and the initially adverse external conditions the strategy has been focussed on the challenge the country faces in the articulation of a socially sustainable macroeconomic adjustment to the deteriorated external conditions, while protecting and, where possible, advancing sector-al reform agendas that could foster long-term growth. Within this strategy and in support of the efforts of the Mexican government to maintain macroeconomic stability during the upcoming political transition, the World Bank approved last December two fast disbursing, structural adjustment loans for a total amount of USSl. 1 billion. These two loans support the structural reforms the Mexican authorities are undertaking in, respectively, the area of fiscal decentralization from federal to subnational governments and the restructuring of the banking sector. Both areas are likely to remain present in the program of the World Bank with Mexico over the next few years. With a total outstanding debt of about US%1 1 billion, or slightly over 9 percent of the total Bank’s portfolio, annual repayment requirements for Mexico are now at approximately US$l.3 billion. The present lending program could lead to a slightly positive net flow of resources to Mexico through a combination of adjustment and investment lending. If however, a balanced net flow is to be maintained in the near future, the Mexican government and the World Bank face the continuing challenge to identify sufficient areas where, and adequate instruments through which the support of the World Bank can be channeled and is justified on the basis of its development impact. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-61- APPENDIX III Last year the Bank approved a transitional strategy for the 1999-2000 period, which has two objectives. The first objective of the strategy is to strengthen the process of structural change in the area of decentralization in order to support a greater degree of social development, reduce poverty and promote more balanced regional development. The second objective is to encourage private-sector participation in economic growth. A new strategy will be prepared in consultation with the incoming authorities following elections scheduled for July 2000. Progress towards achieving the first strategic goal was made in 1999, when the Bank approved one operation for US$800 million to support the process of decentralization, to increase the autonomy of local governments, and to strengthen the capacity of subnational governments to manage public funds. For 2000, the Bank is considering the financing of a project to assist the Mexican government in the restructuring and consolidation of the banking system to help reactivate, in the medium term, the expansion of credit to the private sector. Also, the Bank is working with the Mexican authorities to design a program to assist FOVl (Fond0 de Vivienda) in ensuring sufftcient funding for the period 2000-03 and implementing a new subsidy strategy. The Bank is also considering the financing of a program that will support the development of small- and medium-size enterprises. In addition, the Bank is preparing a second phase of a program to improve workers’ mobility. Overall, the Bank is studying operations worth about US$2 billion for 2000-01 and expects to have about US%1 billion approved in 2000, of which US$250 million have been approved for IPAB.

The mission discussed with the authorities possible improvements to the data on external indebtedness and on external reserves in order to facilitate the assessment of external vulnerability. A technical mission in December 1998 assisted in the creation of a monitoring system of commercial banks’ external credit lines. Several measures on improving debt statistics, consistent with the recommendations of the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition, have been incorporated under the program including: (1) the commitment to establish projections of external debt service for the next year (quarterly profile) and annual for the next five years (annual profile) for commercial banks resident in Mexico consolidated with their nonresident branches and agencies; (2) the creation of a working group comprising stalT of the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit and the Bank of Mexico, that will be responsible for expanding the coverage of statistics on external debt of the nonbank private sector; and (3) the establishment of statistics on external liabilities of publicly-traded companies registered with the Mexican stock exchange, including the external debt outstanding, the amortization schedule for the next year (quarterly profile) and for the next five years (annual profile) broken down by maturity (short-term versus medium- and long-term) and type of instrument (bank loan, trade credit, and bond placements). The staff encouraged the authorities to monitor the foreign exchange exposure of nonbank entities to ensure a comprehensive coverage of current and contingent foreign exchange liabilities in the economy. Under the program, the authorities have been making progress in reporting international reserves according to the guidelines established under the Second Review of the Special Data Dissemination Standard-the principal progress has been in widening the coverage of international reserves to include contingent liabilities. The staff identified as outstanding statistical issues the treatment of privately financed investment projects (PIDIREGAS) and the treatment of residency in the balance of payments. l PIDIREGAS: The recording of PIDIREGAS projects deviates from the manual of Government Finance Statistics and projects are not fi.rlly reflected in the debt statistics (see Box 5 for more details). 0 Balance of payments: Mexican banking statistics consolidate resident Mexican banks with their nonresident branches and do not record flows in the balance of payments between the resident Mexican bank entity and its nonresident entity. The authorities have committed under the program to establish two series of external liabilities of the banking system, one on the basis of a residency criterion, and the other on the basis of a domicile criterion, before the third review, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicMexico: Core Statistical Indicators As of February 15,200O Date of Latest Observation Date Received Frequency of Data 1/ Frequency of Reporting 11 Source of Update 2/ Mode of Reporting 31 Confidentiality 4 I Frequency of Publication 1 / Central Overall External Intema- Bank Reserve/ Consumer Current Govem- Debt/ Exchange tional Balance Base Broad Interest Price Exports/ Account ment GDP/ Debt Rates Reserves Sheet Money Money Rates Index Imports Balance Balance GNP Service End- Third Fourth Third Fourth Feb. 15 Feb. 14 Feb. 11 Feb. 14 Dec.

This memorandum sets out the targets and assumptions that will be applied under the program with Mexico for 2000. 2. Quarterly performance criteria have been established for March, June, and September 2000 covering (i) the overall and primary balances of the nonfinancial public sector; (ii) net international reserves of the Bank of Mexico; (iii) net domestic assets of the Bank of Mexico; (iv) net external borrowing by the public sector; and (v) net external short-term borrowing by the public sector. Indicative targets for the above mentioned items have been established for December 2000 (Tables l-3). 3. The program will monitor the debt service on net liabilities related to bank restructuring and debtor support operations as a quarterly indicative target (Table 4). In 2000, the budgetary transfer to IPAB will be no less than MeS34.6 billion which along with IPAB’s revenue from asset recoveries and part of deposit insurance fees charged to the banks, will cover an amount equivalent to the real component of interest accrued on net IPAB bank restructuring liabilities estimated at 1.2 percent of GDP.’ Budget transfers to debtor support programs will equal MexS5.4 billion in 2000. 4. The program will include the monitoring of the operational fiscal deficit as an indicative quarterly target, defined as the difference between the overall balance and the inflation component of interest payments on nonindexed government debt, The operational fiscal deficit is projected to be the equivalent of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2000 (Table 4). 5. The program will monitor the gross and net public sector debt and the net bank restructuring and debtor support liabilities. The ratio of net domestic public sector debt to GDP declined from 27.9 percent at end-1998 to 25.3 percent at end-1999 and is projected to remain stable at 25.2 percent at end-2000.2 In the process, the program will also monitor the ’ IPAB’s net bank restructuring liabilities at end-1999 were Mex$725 billion, and are defined as IPAB’s gross bank restructuring liabilities of Mex$844 billion net of (i) loans by Bank of Mexico of Mex$63.8 billion and by National Financiera of Mex$l0.6 billion; (ii) loss sharing agreements with commercial banks of MexS23.3 billion; and (iii) debtor support operations of Mex$19.3 billion. Government debtor support liabilities stood at Mex$l94.3 billion at end-1999, including to11 road operator liabilities amounting to Mex$ZO billion. 2 The net public sector debt is defined as: (i) the net external and domestic debt of the federal government; (ii) the net external debt of public enterprises under direct budgetary control; and (iii) the net external debt of the development banks, The domestic assets of the federal government include assets held in the contingency fund and the cash balance of the federal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 73 - ATTACHMENT II inflation adjustment to the principal of government indexed obligations (Udibonos and SAR), the capitalized accrued interest on debt related to bank restructuring and support operations, and new bond-based bank restructuring and debtor support operations (including, but not limited to Punto Final). 6. The program will monitor the direct and conditional executed privately financed infrastructure projects (PIDIREGAS) as an indicative target. Executed projects financed via PIDIREGAS in 2000 will not exceed Mex$79.9 billion (see Table 4). 7. The program will include the monitoring of the total financial intermediation of the development banks and trust funds as an indicative quarterly target. During 2000, total financial intermediation of the development banks and trust tknds will not exceed Mex$lO.5 billion (see Table 4). 8. The program will monitor the primary expenditure of the nonfinancial public sector as a quarterly indicative target. Total budgetary primary expenditure is targeted at Mex$976 billion in 2000 consistent with paragraphs 9 and 10 below (see Table 4). n. ADJUSTMENTS To PEFWORMANCE CRITERIA 9. In accordance with Article 36 of the Budget Expenditure Law for 2000 (Decreto Aprobatorio de Presupuesto de Egresos de la Federacidn para el Ejercicio Fiscai de 2000), shortfalls in nonfinancial public sector overall revenue, in excess of 1 percent of the amount of tax revenue projected in the budget on a cumulative quarterly basis, equivalent to Mex$5,654 million for the year, will be fully matched with expenditure cuts (Table 5). In this case, the authorities will communicate to the Fund the measures jointly determined with congress to address the fiscal gap. Expenditure reductions will be selective and efforts will be made not to alter expenditure on social programs. The adequacy of these measures will be monitored under the program. The quarterly performance criteria for 2000 on nonfinancial public sector finances will be adjusted downward by the revenue shortfall up to the equivalent of 1 percent of projected tax revenue (see Table 1). 10. In accordance with Article 35 of the Budget Expenditure Law for 2000, in the event of higher-than-expected revenue: (i) public enterprises (under direct budgetary control) may increase expenditure by the amount of excess revenue only if consistent with the observance of the overall public sector balance; (ii) federal government revenue (net of certain nontax revenue government’s general account at the BOM.
