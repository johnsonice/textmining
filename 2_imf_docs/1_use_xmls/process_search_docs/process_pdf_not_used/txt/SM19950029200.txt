Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Swaziland were held in Mbabane during August 17.September 1, 1995. u Swaziland, which has no outstanding use of Fund credit, accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement in December 1989. and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on current international payments and transfers. Swaziland is on the standard U-month consultation cycle, and the last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 18, 1994 (SM/94/150). At that time, Directors expressed concern about the sharp deterioration in Swaziland's economic performance, particularly the severe worsening of the fiscal situation, and stressed the urgency of carefully formulating a comprehensive medium-term fiscal adjustment strategy, focusing on expenditure control, tax administration improvement, and revenue-enhancing measures. The quality of data on international reserves, monetary aggregates, exchange and interest rates, and consumer prices is good, but the timeliness needs improvement. Data on government finance statistics (GFS) are available through 1989. GFS data were reported in 1993 for 1990-91, but were not published because of outstanding issues. Fiscal data are provided to the staff only during Article IV consultation missions and/or following budget presentation to Parliament. There is a one-year lag in reporting import data, and 1991 is the last year for which official export data are available. At present, official data on national accounts are available only through 1991, and information regarding trade prices and volumes and unemployment is unavailable. II. Backuound to the Discussions The macroeconomic performance of Swaziland has deteriorated sharply over the last several years. Real GDP growth is estimated to have averaged 1.5 percent annually over the 1991.94 period (Table l), below the rate of population growth. The low economic growth reflected decreased foreign direct investment as economic sanctions against South Africa were lifted, as well as the recession in South Africa, which accounts for 90 percent and I/ The mission consisted of Mr. Carstens (head), Mr. Farah, Mr. Chirwn, Mr. Bingham (all AFR), Mr. Arvanitis (EP-STA), and Ms. Laidlaw (assistait~ AFR). The mission met with the Honorable Derek van Wissell (Minister for Finance), Mr. J. Nxumalo (Governor of the Central Bank of Swaziland), as well as with other senior government officials, and with representatives of the private sector, labor unions, and the donor community.

Inflation increased from 11 percent in 1991 to about 14 percent in 1994. 2J In 1995, real GDP is projected to grow by 3.1 percent--slightly more than the 2.6 percent rate of growth achieved in 1994, mainly because of an expansion in manufacturing output; private investment is expected to strengthen in the wake of new investments in the pulp and sugar industries. The rate of inflation is projected to decline to about 11 percent, reflecting the falling inflation rate in South Africa. The sharp deterioration in the government budget since 1990/91 (April- March) continued through 1994/95 (Chart 1). Current expenditure increased from 19 percent of GDP in 1990/91 to 28 percent in 1994/95, reflecting rapid growth in the Government's wage bill and expenditure on goods and services. The wage bill (excluding lump-sum payments to a pension scheme) rose from 10 percent of GDP to 15 percent, driven by wage adjustments and an expansion of the civil service establishment (Table 2). The increase in government expenditure on goods and services--about 3 percentage points of GDP-- mirrored the expansion of the civil service and of capital expenditure, as well as a lack of effective expenditure control. Subsidies and transfers have also shown a similar upward trend. Capital expenditure (excluding a one-off outlay on an airplane in 1994/95) rase by 1 percentage point of GDP during 1990/91-1994/95. Overall revenue remained flat during 1990/91- 1994/95, and consequently, the budget balance shifted from a surplus of 7 percent of GDP in 1990/91 to a deficit of 6 percent in 1994/95. During this period, the deficit was mainly financed through a drawdown of government deposits and some asset sales. I/ South Africa and Swaziland are members of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), which allows for the free movement of goods within the borders of the Customs Union. SACU revenues are collected by South Africa on behalf of the other members and then distributed according to an agreed-upon revenue sharing formula. Other members of SACU are Botswana, Lesotho, and Namibia. Swaziland is also a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA), in conjunction with Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa, and its currency, the lilangeni, is pegged one-to-one to the South African rand. 2/ Because of Swaziland's membership in SACU and the fixed relationship between the Swaziland lilangeni and the South African rand, price developments in Swaziland are heavily influenced by price movements in South Africa; however, since 1993, the consumer price index of Swaziland has grown faster than that of South Africa, mainly because food prices--which account for a larger weight in the Swazi price index than in South Africa--have increased as a result of droughts.

However, the improvement in the budget is largely attributed to a rise in SACU receipts of about 2 percentage points of GDP, and a decline of capital expenditure (from 10 percent of GDP to 7 percent), as a result of the one- off expenditure on the airplane in 1994/95. The underlying expenditure trends are expected to continue in 1995/96. Current expenditure is budgeted to increase further, to 29 percent of GDP, largely because of a surge in subsidies and transfers. The wage bill is budgeted to grow by 17 percent--6 percentage points higher than the projected inflation rate. Moreover, a recently introduced medical referral scheme for civil servants is likely to lead to an even higher wage bill than that included in the budget. lJ Expenditure on goods and services is budgeted to decline in real terms, reflecting the authorities' stated plan of tightening expenditure controls. Broad money 2,' grew by 11 percent in 1994, as the impact of a substantial increase in domestic credit was offset by a decline in net foreign as.sets. The increase in domestic credit reflected in large part the drawdown of government deposits held abroad. J/ Credit to the private sector increased by 18 percent, owing mainly to a sharp rise in trade finance. Broad money growth decelerated sharply in the first half of 1995, as the rate of domestic credit expansion declined in response to a moderation in the government financing requirement and a stagnation in private sector credit growth, partly reflecting a sharp fall in trade financing. Notwithstanding the decline of foreign reserves over the past two years, the banking system has continued to maintain considerable exce.ss reserves with the Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS), albeit at a lower level than in the past. The origin of the buildup of excess re.serves in the banking system lies in the rapid accumulation of foreign reserves in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This excess liquidity remains bottled up in the banking system, partly because of a minimum Local Asset Ratio (LAR) requirement imposed on commercial banks. &/ As a result of the LAR 1;/ The new scheme was expected to start in June 1995, but has been delayed pending further negotiation on the regulations governing the scheme. 2/ Analysis of the demand for money in Swaziland is complicated by the substantial amount of unrecorded South African rand in circulation in the economy 3J The Government holds substantial deposits abroad under the Capital Investment Fund (CIF). These deposits are treated in the monetary survey as part of the foreign assets of the monetary authorities, with a corresponding deposit liability under credit to Government. f?/ The minimum Local Asset Ratio (LAR) requires commercial banks to invest 95 percent of their domestic liabilities in domestic assets. In practice the Central Bank has in recent years allowed banks to invest more than 5 percent of their domestic liabilities in foreign assets in order to accommodate forward foreign exchange cover arrangements for their clients.

The CBS raised its discount rate from 11 percent to 12 percent in late 1994, and again to 13.8 percent in early 1995, to align its interest rates more closely to those in South Africa. 3J Consequently, both lending and deposit rates increased in the first half of 1995. The deficit in the external current account (excluding transfers), which doubled between 1990 and 1993 to 10.6 percent of GDP, narrowed to about 7.2 percent in 1994. The favorable performance of commodity exports--particularly wood pulp, citrus fruits, and canned fruits--contributed to this improvement, and compensated for a decline in Swazi mine workers' remittances from South Africa. As inflows of grants have been substantial, the overall current account position has been in surplus in most years. However, net capital outflows have caused deficits in the overall balance of payments in 1993 and 1994. Hence, gross official reserves decreased to the equivalent of 3.0 months of imports in 1994. from 4.4 months in 1992. In 1995, the external current account (excluding transfers) is projected to worsen to a deficit of 11.6 percent of GDP, because of an expected increase in imports and a decline in sugar exports. The real effective exchange rate of the lilangeni appreciated by 3 percent in the a-month period ended August 1995, reflecting mainly a higher rate of inflation relative to partner countries (Chart 2). III. Report on the Discussions Under the assumption of a continuation of recent trends of stagnant foreign direct investment flows, 4J the staff's medium-term projections, which, in a baseline scenario, are consistent with those of the authorities, indicate that real GDP growth would be limited to 2-3 percent during lJ The interest rate on commercial bank term deposits with the Central Bank is currently 8.75 percent. The interest rate on other excess reserves balances is 6 percent. Balances held to meet the 6 percent statutory reserve requirement are unremunerated. 2/ Despite the large published interest rate differential between South Africa and Swaziland, heavy capital outflows did not materialize. This could be due to price discrimination by banks--i.=., providing higher deposit rates to large depositors, which could not be discerned from the published simple average interest rate. J/ The South African discount rate is 15 percent. &/ Private investment, which averaged about 16 percent of GDP during 1987-90, declined to 13 percent in 1994. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. 7 1996-2000, below the rate of population growth of close to 3 percent (Appendix I, Table I). The decline in demand for Swazi mine workers in South Africa, which is expected to continue over the medium term, could also contribute to increasing unemployment and thus to declining per capita national incomes. Fiscal projections based on the continuation of current budgetary trends indicate that the deficit would increase to about 14 percent of GDP by 2000/01 (Appendix I, Table I). In these projections, it is assumed that non-SACU revenues grow in line with nominal GDP, while SACU receipts, consistent with the authorities' thinking, decline by 25 percent from the trend in import growth over 1997/98-1998/99, reflecting the expected renegotiation of the revenue-sharing formula (expected to be finalized in early 1996). Consequently, overall revenue would decline to about 28 percent of GDP. On the expenditure side, the scenario of unchanged policies suggests that the government wage bill would continue to increase by 4-5 percent a year in real terms, owing to civil service expansion and average wage adjustments, while other expenditures would grow broadly in line with inflation. Government expenditure would thus be dominated by an ever-rising wage bill, which would absorb about 65 percent of total revenue by 2000/01. The financing needs of the deficits would be very large--about E 3 billion over the projection period--resulting in a rapid depletion of international reserves, and destabilization of the economy. Against this background, the discussions with the authorities focused on the structural reforms needed to raise the level of investment and on the fiscal adjustment required to enhance macroeconomic stability. Under an alternative adjustment scenario (Appendix I, Table II), the staff discussed the benefits of a strong fiscal adjustment strategy. Thus, if the fiscal deficit could be kept within a range of 3-3.5 percent over the projection period, it would be possible to have a substantially lower debt burden, a much higher contribution of government savings, and considerably smaller deficits in the external current account relative to the baseline scenario. Improved national savings, combined with an improvement in the investment climate, would also contribute to higher real GDP growth rates, providing greater scope for increases in per capita income. 1. Fiscal wlicies The authorities informed the mission that they planned to introduce measures to bring about fiscal adjustment. On the revenue side, the plans are to: (i) reduce the corporate income tax rate--currently at 37.5 percent, while removing existing tax holidays and tax exemptions for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - both private and public enterprises; u (ii) increase the sales tax rate on services from 5 percent to 10 percent; (iii) raise the fuel levy to a level comparable to that of South Africa; u and (iv) increase user fees for government services. On the expenditure side, the authorities plan to: (i) impose a civil service hiring freeze; (ii) allow for less than full cost of living adjustments in civil service wages; (iii) restrict the growth of expenditure on goods and services end transfers end subsidies to below nominal GDP growth; and (iv) Limit capital expenditure to zero growth in real terms. Moreover, the authorities stated that they planned to operate under strict budget principles, limiting growth in expenditure on goods and services through reallocations and tightening of expenditure controls. J/ The mission stressed the need for stronger measures to further contain expenditure growth and to enhance domestic revenue sources. &/ In the context of an alternative medium-term scenario (Appendix I, Table II), the staff explained that additional revenue-enhancing and expenditure-reducing measures would be needed in order to limit the budget deficit to a level that could be financed without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability. Given the clouded outlook for SACU receipts, the mission reiterated the recommendations of the recent IMF missions with regard to increasing the sales tax rate to levels comparable to those in South Africa; the staff's alternative scenario of fiscal adjustment indicates that an increase of the sales tax rate to 12 percent would maintain the revenue/GDP ratio at about 29 percent. However, the authorities were of the view that the lower sales tax rate in Swaziland compared with the VAT in South Africa provided an incentive for importers to declare their imports and pay the domestic sales 1/ A Tax Advisory Committee is studying options for tax reform, including the corporate and individual income tax. 2/ Swaziland's fuel levy is 20 cents per liter, compared with 61 cents in South Africa. 2/ The authorities recently introduced expenditure control mechanisms consistent with the recent IMF technical assistance mission. These mechanisms include: (i) a provision that warrants issued to controlling officers for recurrent expenditure apply for only three months rather than six months as in the past; and (ii) the computerization of the accounting system to assist in the monitoring of expenditure. &/ The authorities' fiscal projections, which are contained in their 1996/97 Budget Outlook Paper, indicate that proposed expenditure-restraining and revenue-enhancing measures would only limit the budget deficit to 7 percent of GDP in 1998/99. In these projections, revenue declines to about 28 percent of GDP as planned revenue-enhancing measures only partially offset the projected decline in SACU receipts, and the expenditure/GDP ratio would still remain about 35 percent, with the wage bill/GDP ratio still amounting to 15 percent.

As regards the authorities' plan to reduce the corporate income tax rate and remove ad hoc tax holidays end tax exemptions, the mission strongly advised that the rates be reduced gradually to a level broadly comparable to that of other countries in the region. u It cautioned that a large reduction in the rate could undermine fiscal credibility, given that the corporate tax accounts for one fifth of total revenue. On the expenditure side, the mission emphasized the need to speed up the effort to contain government expenditure growth, and particularly the wage bill. In this regard. the mission welcomed the establishment of the Public Sector Management Program, which will review public sector objectives, organizational structures. and resource allocation and utilization, with a view to identifying key reform areas. 3J However, the mission underscored the need to pursue an active strategy to scale down the size of the civil service in order to reduce personnel costs to the Government's own target of 40 percent of total revenue. &/ In the mission's view, the reduction of the wage bill to a level consistent with the Government's target. combined with the authorities' other proposed measures to limit government expenditures, would be required to reduce the overall expenditure/GDP ratio to a sustainable Level. The public enterprises' losses end concomitant transfers from the budget continue to grow, and are exerting more pressure on government finances. The authorities stated that recent increases in transfers to parastatals were due to restructuring and that recent performance contracts lJ The authorities' concern is that, given the weakness of Swazi border controls, an increase in the sales tax rate to a Level comparable to the value-added tax (VAT) rate in South Africa (14 percent) would increase sales tax evasion. Currently, the difference between the sales tax rate in Swaziland and the VAT rate in South Africa gives an incentive to importers to declare their imports and pay the Swazi sales tax instead of letting the South African VAT be passed on to import prices. 2/ The corporate tax rate in Botswana is 15 percent for manufacturing, end 25 percent for other sectors. Lesotho has a corporate tax rate of 40 percent for all sectors other than manufacturing; a reduced rate of 15 percent applies to all manufacturing companies except for nonresident companies, which are subject to a tax rate of 25 percent. I/ The World Bank public expenditure review was conducted in 1991, end the report was issued in 1993. 4J The report of the Richards Commission (1988) called for personnel outlays to be limited to 40 percent of total government revenue.

The authorities also confirmed that they intended to request IMF technical assistance on government finance statistics in order to strengthen the budgeting process. 2. Monetarv and external sector uolicies The mission welcomed the authorities' intention to align interest rates more closely with those in South Africa, as well as the recent increase in the official discount rate. However, the staff urged the authorities to accompany this change in policy with measures to address the more fundamental structural problems, reflected in the substantial excess Liquidity in the banking system, which were undermining the efficient operation of the domestic financial system and the emergence of market- determined interest rates. The mission was also concerned that the relatively passive stance of monetary policy engendered by the substantial excess liquidity in the banking system might undermine the capacity of the Central Bank to manage monetary policy under conditions where a deterioration of the fiscal position would put external reserves under pressure. u Accordingly, the staff encouraged the authorities to phase out the LAR and to take appropriate measures, in parallel, to manage the supply of reserve money more effectively, so as to moderate the level of excess liquidity in the banking system end reduce the interest rate differential between South Africa and Swaziland. 2/ To this end, the mission encouraged the authorities, in particular. to develop the treasury bill as an instrument of monetary policy. To address the current stock of excess balances et the CBS, the authorities should give consideration to the replacement of those balances with CBS bills (compulsory, at least initially, but paying a similar rate of return), reducing the interest rate on new excess balances to zero, 3J and, as conditions permit, replacing the CBS bills in a phased manner with market-based treasury bills. The management of liquidity (at the margin) through market-based instruments will give the CBS more effective control over interest rates in Swaziland. Distortions in the interest rate structure arising from a relatively high statutory reserve requirement, could be addressed by a gradual reduction in this requirement, as conditions permit. The authorities indicated that some relaxation of the LAR regulations was under consideration and that there 1/ Given Swaziland's membership in the CMA, the principal focus of monetary policy will be to maintain the competitiveness of the fixed exchange rate of the lilangeni against other member currencies. '2/ The treasury bill rate in Swaziland is 10.3 percent (June 1995), compared with 13.7 percent in South Africa. y Such an approach would expedite the relaxation of the LAR requirement by mitigating the impact of such a relaxation on the external reserve position of the Central Bank.

The mission was encouraged by the positive steps taken to address the problems at the Swaziland Development and Savings Bank (SDSB). 1/ An MAE consultant assisted with the formulation of the appropriate course of action in reforming the bank. Preliminary indications suggest that the critical issue at present is the creation of appropriate institutional and managerial structures to ensure that, following restructuring, the bank can operate independently and in a manner that is consistent with sound banking practices. The authorities are currently considering the appropriate range of activities that the bank should undertake, and the institutional end financial structure of the bank. The mission underscored the need to speed up the restructuring process so that the bank could become financially viable, and stop being a permanent drain on budgetary resources. As regards sound prudential management of banks' foreign positions in general, staff proposed that Swaziland follow standard international practice and place limits, as a percentage of capital, on a commercial bank's net foreign currency exposure. 2/ The staff suggested that the South African x-and should be included in the definition of foreign currency for this purpose, despite the current monetary arrangement (i.e., the CMA), to ensure that the Central Bank retains flexibility to reassess its exchange rate arrangements in the future. Given Swaziland's extensive linkage with South Africa, the mission agreed with the authorities' intention to leave the present exchange rate arrangement (peg to the South African rand) unchanged. As regards the level of the peg (presently one-to-one), the mission noted that although unit Labor costs in Swaziland had been rising over recent years, they remained below those in South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana, 2/ and that export growth in real terms had averaged about 7 percent annually during 1992-94. Nontraditional exports had contributed importantly to this expansion. Moreover, with the implementation of an adequate fiscal adjustment effort over the medium term, the projected deficits in the external current account were expected to be contained to sustainable levels. ft/ In that case, the ratios of debt to GDP (20 percent in 1994) and of debt service to exports 1/ Estimates indicate that nonperforming loans account for 68 percent of the bank's portfolio. 2/ There are currently no foreign exchange exposure regulations on commercial banks in Swaziland. J/ Trends in relative unit lsbor costs were discussed in the paper on recent economic developments (SM/94/166; July 5, 1994) accompanying the 1994 Article IV consultation. This analysis end the available information on recent wage and productivity developments support the view expressed here. &/ This assessment takes into account the forecast declines in labor income remittances from South Africa and SACU receipts.

Nevertheless, the mission also emphasized the importance of cost containment through skill formation and productivity increases to safeguard competitiveness. 3. ImDrovine the investment climate In the late 198Os, Swaziland benefited from a significant flow of foreign direct investment because of its close links to South Africa, where economic sanctions had been imposed, and its preferential access to key markets. 1/ However, since the removal of sanctions against South Africa, foreign direct investment flows to Swaziland have dwindled, constraining Swaziland's economic growth. M0PXWer, the recent increase in labor unrest, a lengthy approval system for new investment and work permits for expatriates, and continuing bottlenecks in the areas of telecommunications, power, and transportation have also clouded the business climate. The authorities indicated that they planned to introduce measures to improve the business climate. These measures would include the implementation of the principal elements of the Cross Border Initiative (CBI): reform of the approval system for new investments and work permits for expatriates; adoption of an Investment Code: and the establishment of a one-stop investment cater. In addition, a National Development Strategy, outlining concrete options for economic and social reforms, would be adopted. The reduction in the corporate income tax rate is also expected to facilitate investment and employment growth. MCJKeOVe?Z, the authorities noted ongoing improvements in telecommunications and infrastructure, the expansion of industrial parks, and increased emphasis on vocational training to improve the skill mix of the labor force. The mission welcomed the efforts already under way to improve the investment climate, but stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts to enhance coordination between different government agencies involved in the implementation of the CBI policies. The mission underscored the need to identify and address the factors contributing to high nominal wage settlements in the private sector, and strengthen vocational training in order to contain unit labor costs and guard against erosion of Swaziland's external competitiveness. J/ This becomes all the more important in a period when South Africa, Swaziland's main export market, is liberalizing its trade regime. The mission also expressed concern about the recent worsening of industrial relations. The drafting of an Industrial Relations 1/ Swaziland, as a member of the African.

Statistical issues The mission stressed the need to improve the timeliness and the quality of statistical data and to expand the statistical data base of the Central Statistical Office. The authorities acknowledged the existing statistical problems and noted inadequate staff as one of the major sources of the problem. Nevertheless, the staff representatives underscored the importance of current and reliable data in order to closely monitor economic developments, particularly in a period where the Swazi economy is going through major changes. IV. Staff ADDraisal Swaziland's financial and economic performance has deteriorated sharply over the last few years. The key challenge facing the authorities is, therefore, to move swiftly to undertake measures that would restore financial stability as well as revive economic and employment growth. Any delay in adopting coherent policy responses would imply major risks for the immediate future. The outlook for the country depends on the authorities' ability to address its basic socioeconomic problems--low economic growth and rising unemployment--through the adoption of prudent macroeconomic and structural policies. A growth-oriented strategy for Swaziland will need to focus both on raising the level of domestic savings--especially by reducing government dissaving-and on promoting private sector investment. The staff welcomes the authorities' plan to improve the business climate by streamlining investment regulations, improving infrastructure, and enhancing the skill mix of the labor force. Nevertheless, the staff urges the authorities to speed up the implementation of these reforms in order to strengthen private sector growth, which is essential for improving Swaziland's economic and employment growth prospects. Given Swaziland's membership in the CMA and the one-to-one peg of the lilangeni and the South African rand, fiscal policy remains the main macroeconomic policy instrument. The recent budgetary problems underscore the urgent need for a comprehensive review of public expenditures and a clear definition of priority functions of government within the limits of available resources. The overriding policy priority in the near and medium term is for the Government to implement strong and timely measures that will have a decisive impact on recent unsustainable expenditure trends. To this end, the staff urges the authorities to contain current expenditures, particularly the wage bill.

However, an active strategy to scale down the size of the civil service would, in the view of the staff. be required to reduce personnel costs to the Government's target of 40 percent of total revenue over the medium term. Developmental expenditures should be targeted to broaden the economy's productive base. The staff welcomes the authorities' plan to increase and harmonize the sales tax rates, and to raise the fuel levy and government fees. In this context, the staff attaches great importance to the alignment of the sales tax rate with that of South Africa (currently at 14 percent), as well as the strengthening of the sales tax administration, along the lines recommended by the recent IMF technical assistance mission. The staff has also noted and broadly supports the authorities' plan to reduce the corporate income tax rate and remove existing ad hoc tax exemptions. However, given the uncertainty of the SACU arrangement, it is important to avoid making any drastic reductions in the corporate income tax rate, which could undermine fiscal credibility. The authorities' plan to restructure, commercialize, or privatize parastatals is welcome. However, the staff urges the authorities to speed up public enterprise reforms in order to reduce their drain on the budget. Moreover, given the major role that the public enterprises play in supplying power, telecommunications, and transportation services, improving the parastatals' performance will be crucial to the removal of the existing infrastructural bottlenecks. The recent change in policy to align interest rates more closely with those in South Africa is a welcome step. Nevertheless, to address the problem of excess rexrve buildup in the banking system, the staff believes that the L4R requirement should be phased out, and that the authorities should take appropriate measures to develop a treasury bill market that would provide a basis for both the market-determination of interest rates and a more effective management of the supply of reserve money. The staff also supports the positive steps taken to address the problems at Swaziland Savings and Development Bank, but underscores the urgent need to speed up the institutional and financial reforms to ensure the long-term viability of the bank. To improve the prudential management of the foreign positions of banks in general, the authorities should introduce appropriate foreign exchange exposure regulations for the commercial banks. Given Swaziland's extensive links with South Africa, the staff supports the authorities' intention to maintain the present fixed exchange rate regime However, under such an exchange regime, containment of labor c0st.s through wage restraint is, in the staff's judgment, essential for safeguarding the external competitiveness of Swaziland. This is particularly important in view of the expected decline in labor remittances from South Africa, the uncertainty surrounding the SACU arrangement, and South Africa's ongoing efforts to liberalize its trade regime.

The baseline scenario (Table I) rests on the assumption that the authorities do not undertake reforms in investment regulations and measures to control public expenditure and enhance government revenue. The alternative scenario (Table II) is based on the assumption that the authorities implement reforms to appropriately streamline investment regulations, restrain government expenditure growth, and introduce adequate revenue measures. In both scenarios, it is assumed that the lilangeni remains pegged one-to-one to the South African rand and that Swaziland's inflation mirrors that of South Africa. I. Baseline Scenario In this scenario, real GDP is projected to grow by 2.4 percent a year on average during 1996-2000, reflecting a stagnation in private sector investment, which had previously been the source of growth in Swaziland. 1,' With a population growth rate of about 3 percent a year, per capita income would continue to decline, and unemployment would be rising. On the fiscal side, the following revenue assumptions were made: (i) the corporate income tax rate is reduced to 30 percent in 1996/97, and exemptions and ad hoc tax holidays are removed to offset the reduction in the tax rate; (ii) the sales tax rate on services is increased to 10 percent; and (iii) consistent with the authorities' thinking, SACU receipts decline by 15 percent in 1997/98 and 10 percent in 1998/99, given the trend in import growth. The decline in SACU receipts would reduce the revenue/GDP ratio to about 28 percent in 2000/01, as these receipts are only partially offset by the introduced revenue measures. on government expenditure, the following assumptions were made: (i) there are annual real increases of 4-5 percent in the wage bill, reflecting average wage adjustments and civil service establishment increases; (ii) expenditure on goods and services and subsidies and transfers grow in line with inflation; and (iii) there is no real increase in capital expenditure. Based on such trends, the budget deficit would reach about 14 percent of GDP by the year 2000/01, and the cumulative borrowing requirement would amount to about E 3 billion during 1996-2001 (Table I). Because of the increased government dissaving and lack of sufficient investment growth to boost exports, national savings would be drastically reduced and the external current account deficit would increase to about 12 percent of GDP by 2000. The external debt/GDP ratio would double to 1/ Official projections, which are through 1998, indicated similar growth trends.

Moreover, the deteriorating fiscal situation would also lead to a further eroSion of investor confidence that could, in turn, lead to a further deceleration of economic growth, and require a review of the current exchange arrangement. II. Alternative Scenario The alternative scenario focuses on a strong fiscal adjustment effort, and reforms of the regulatory framework to facilitate investment. In the mission's assessment, private investment has to rise to at least 15 percent of GDP in order to induce real GDP growth--about 4 percent- -sufficient to avoid declining per capita income. Under this scenario, it is assumed that reforms such as the implementation of the CBI, the improvement of infrastructure, and the development of a competitive labor force would facilitate an increase in private investment to a level that would result at least in nondeclining per capita income. On the fiscal side, additional revenue measures, including the raising of the sales tax rate to 12 percent, are assumed to be implemented by 1996/97. As in the baseline scenario. the corporate income tax rate is assumed to be reduced to 30 percent, and SACU receipts are assumed to decline by 25 percent over 1997/98-1998/99. Consequently, the revenue/GDP ratio would stabilize at around 29 percent. On the expenditure side, the following assumptions were made: (i) the growth of the wage bill is kept below that of nominal GDP by allowing for less than a cast of living adjustment, combined with a reduction of about 15 percent in the civil service over the projection period; (ii) expenditure on goods and services grows in line with inflation; (iii) subsidies and transfers remain constant as a percent of GDP through the projection period, as reduced public enterprise subsidies are offset by increased transfers arising from the retrenchment exercise; and (iv) there is zero real growth in capital expenditure. Based on these assumptions, the government expenditure/GDP ratio declines to about 32 percent by 2001/01. Consequently, the government deficit would stabilize at around 3 percent in 2000/01, with accumulated deficits amounting to about E 1 billion. Consistent with the fiscal adjustment and increased investment based on higher national savings, the external current account deficit would stabilize at about 4 percent over the medium term. Increased foreign direct investment inflows would improve the overall balance of payments over the projection period, and the external debt/GDP ratio and debt servicing costs would rise substantially less than in the baseline scenario.

Exchanee Rate Arraneement Following the renegotiation of the Rand Monetary Agreement, now called "Trilateral Monetary Agreement," in April 1986, the rand ceased to constitute legal tender in Swaziland effective July 1, 1986. However, the lilangeni (plural: emalangeni) continues to be pegged to the South African rand at E 1 - R 1. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar: exchange rates for the U.S. dollar are based on the floating middle rate of the South African rand against the U.S. dollar. The rate on September 27, 1995 was El - US$O.2742. VIII Last Article IV Consultation Swaziland was placed on the 12-month consultation cycle in May 1993. The last full Article IV consultation discussions took place in Mbabane during March 31-April 14, 1994. The Executive Board discussed the report (SM/94/150) on July 18, 1994. The 1995 Article IV consultation should have been completed by October 18, 1995. Notification of the delay was issued to the Board on October 5, 1995 (EBD/95/136). IX. Technical Assistance A technical assistance mission from MAE visited Swaziland in January 1995 to review and assess the effectiveness of technical assistance in foreign exchange management and banking supervision furnished in 1993. Following the 1993 interim Article IV consultation, the Ministry of Finance requested Fund technical assistance in the area of tax administration. Consequently, a technical assistance mission from FAD visited Mbabane in January 1994 to review possible reforms in the current system of indirect taxation. In response to a request from the authorities, a technical assistance mission from FAD visited Mbabane during the period November 30-December 13, 1994 to provide assistance in the planning and budgeting system, budget implementation procedures, and to examine the structure and administration of income and sales taxes. A follow-up FAD mission visited Mbabane in March 1995 to consider options for reform of the company income tax. X.

The authorities are fully cooperative in providing data to the Fund, and available data are provided to the Fund with a one-month lag. The statistical deficiencies in Swaziland hamper effective surveillance and economic policy formulation, Since 1992 Swaziland has not received Fund technical assistance in statistics. 1. National accounts The quality and timeliness of official national accounts data is weak. In current prices they are reported only through 1991. While on constant prices they are unavailable. The mission uses estimates of the national accounts provided by the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development. 2. Prices Monthly consumer price data are published by the Central Bank of Swaziland and are reported to the Fund with a one-month lag. Estimates of the GDP deflator are provided by the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development. Average wages by skill category and by gender exist through 1992. 3. Government finance statistics Data on government finance statistics (GFS) are available only through 1989. The main problem with GFS data is related to the discrepancies between amounts shown in the derivation tables and in the statistical tables. Additionally, there are classification problems. The authorities indicated that they were aware of the problems and noted their intention to request Fund technical assistance in this area. 4. Monetarv statistics The Central Bank balance sheet and the monetary survey are provided to the Fund with a one-month lag. While the coverage of the banking system is good, the assessment of monetary conditions is complicated by the circulation of substantial unrecorded South African rand in the @XXl0my 5. Balance of Dayments statistics Quarterly foreign trade data are published by the Central Statistics Office. Data on imports are available through the first quarter of 1994. and those on exports are available through 1992. The mission use5 trade data estimates provided by the Central Bank.
