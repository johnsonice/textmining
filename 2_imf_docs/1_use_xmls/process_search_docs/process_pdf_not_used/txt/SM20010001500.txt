The staff team met with Sangko Sentral Governor Buenaventura, Secretary of Finance Pardo, Secretary of Budget and Management Diokno, Secretary of Socio-Economic Planning Medalla, Secretary of Trade Roxas, other senior government officials, and representatives of Congress, trade unions, and the private sector. . The staff team comprised Mr. Rodlauer (head), Mr. Brooks, Ms. Kongsamut (all APD), Mr. Bakker (PDR), Mr. Chalk (PAD), Ms. Mitchell Casselle, Ms. Kourelis and Ms. Basu (all MAP), Ms. Cherebin (expert-MAP), Mr. Maehle (STA), and Ms. Lee (administrative assistant, APD). Both missions overlapped with World Bank missions on banking and were assisted by Mr. Nolan (Senior Resident Representative). l The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 22, 1999 (together with completion of the fourth SBA review). Directors commended the authorities for policies that allowed the Philippines to weather the regional crisis relatively well. While the expansionary fiscal stance was judged appropriate during the crisis, Directors emphasized the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation. They urged the authorities to implement forcefully their structural reform agenda to underpin medium-term growth and poverty alleviation. l The fifth SBA review, originally scheduled for September 1999, was completed on July 3 1,200O. Against the backdrop of weakening investor confidence, Directors urged the authorities to take action to meet the fiscal targets for 2000 and significantly lower the budget deficit target for 200 1. They also encouraged the authorities to allow the peso to fluctuate more freely (with intervention limited to smoothing operations) and to maintain the renewed momentum in key structural reform areas, particularly in the financial and power sectors. l The sixth (and final) SBA review was not completed because of deviations from the program (especially in the fiscal area), and the SBA lapsed at end-2000 without disbursement of the last tranche (SDR 238 million). l The Philippines has accepted the obligations of Article WI Sections 2,3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on making payments and transfers for current international transactions. l It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle. It is also proposed that the Philippines be subject to Post-Program Monitoring (PPM), with the first PPM mission to be held ‘in March/April 2001. l The principal authors of this report are Mr. Rodlauer and Mr. Brooks. A selected issues paper (forthcoming) covers issues relating to tax incentives, foreign exchange intervention, the labor market, and inflation targeting.

SUMMARY 1. Economic performance in 2000 was mixed. Growth likely reached more than 4 percent, inflation was low (albeit rising), and the current account surplus remained sizable. However, already weak investor confidence was undermined further by fiscal slippages and a political crisis arising from allegations of corruption against President Estrada. These problems triggered turmoil in financial markets in late 2000 and increased the economy’s vulnerability to shocks. 2. The fiscal slippage that emerged mid-year resulted in a much higher National Government (NG) deficit (4.5 percent of GNP) than programmed (2.9 percent of GNP). The budget for 2001 presented in September 2000 has been overtaken by events, and the staff projects an NG deficit of about 5 percent of GNP, in the absence of corrective measures. 3. The discussions focused on how economic policy could help contain the fallout from the political crisis, contribute to turning around investor confidence, and sustain the recovery. The authorities and staff broadly agreed that reviving confidence would require-besides resolution of the political crisis-a credible start to fiscal consolidation, a clear focus of monetary policy on containing inflation, continued structural reforms, and decisive steps to improve governance. 4. The authorities recognized that fiscal adjustment was necessary. The authorities and staff agreed that an NG budget deficit target of about 3% percent of GNP for 2001 would balance the need for a start to fiscal consolidation against concerns that a too sharp correction would undermine the growth outlook. However, the authorities saw limited scope for lasting revenue and expenditure measures to be included in a revised budget (as recommended by the staff), given the political crisis and upcoming elections. Instead, they preferred to achieve the deficit target by cutting budgeted spending (through the presidential line-item veto and/or administrative measures), together with efforts at better tax administration and tapping some one-off revenue sources. For the medium-term, the key challenge is to reverse the chronic decline in revenue. 5. Monetary and exchange rate policy has been complicated by the fiscal slippage and turbulent market conditions. The current approach to monetary policy appears broadly consistent with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) inflation objective of about 6% percent by end-2001, and the BSP’s planned move to inflation targeting in 2001 should improve the transparency and consistency of monetary policy. The authorities and staff agreed on the basic tenets of exchange rate policy: the floating of the peso, the need for a sizable reserve cushion, and the importance of an open exchange rate system. 6. . The banking sector remains fairly stable, thanks to past reforms, but vulnerabilities remain. The recent rise in interest rates and depreciation of the peso will put further pressure on banks, and the rehabilitation of Philippine National Bank (PNB) remains to be achieved. New banking legislation and proposed amendments to the BSP Act are important measures in upgrading the regulatory and supervisory regime. However, further legislation is needed to strengthen the BSP’s powers to resolve failed banks. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- 7. Structural reforms regained some momentum in early 2000, but key measures remain to be put in place. Electric power sector legislation, well advanced in Congress, awaits final passage. A new insolvency law is required, and corporate, trade, and labor market reforms are on the agenda. II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM ECONOMIC OUTLOK 8. Economic performance during 2000 was mixed, with a turn for the worse in the final months of the year. On the positive side, growth firmed through the third quarter and likely reached more than 4 percent for the year as a whole; inflation was low (albeit rising); and export growth sustained a sizable current account surplus. Progress was also made on some key structural reforms. However, the positive results were undermined by continued fiscal slippages, governance problems, and concerns about security.’ Coupled with external factors (higher interest rates and oil prices), these problems hurtinvestor confidence, put downward pressure on fmancial markets (especially in the last quarter), and heightened the economy’s vulnerability to shocks. 9. In October 2000, a political crisis arisii from allegations of corruption against President Estrada’ triggered turmoil in fmancial markets. The crisis caused intensified pressure on the peso, prompting sizable foreign exchange intervention by the BSP and an increase in policy interest rates by 400 basis points (Figures 1 and 2).

The calming of markets toward year’s end was due to clearer prospects emerging for resolving ’ Armed conflict with Moslem insurgents in the main southern island of Mindanao intensified in early 2000 (after several years of relative calm) and a series of bombs exploded in Manila in late December. 2 Allegations of cormption made against the President in early October led the House of Representatives to impeach him in November. A trial in the Senate began in early December. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- Figure 1.

Growth was firming prior to the recent turmoil in fInancid markets; but is now expected to slow. Real GDP grew by 4% percent (y/y) in the third quarter of 2000 (led by agriculture and exports-Box 1). Activity is expected to slow in the first half of 2001, because of the higher interest rates, weaker investor confidence, and slowing world demand for electronics. The staff thus estimates GDP growth of 4% percent for 2000 (within the authorities’ 4-5 percent target) and about 2% percent for 2001 (Table 1 and Figure 3). The authorities expect slightly higher growth of 3-3s percent in 2001, as they assume a significant recovery in investor confidence.3 The outlook for 2001 is highly uncertain; for instance, activity would likely slow further if the political crisis is not resolved, world oil prices rise, or external demand falters4 Table 12.

Inflation, subdued over the past two years, is now rising. Headline inflation fell to 3-4 percent (y/y) in the first half of 2000 (because of the impact of a good harvest on food prices), but has since risen to 6.6 percent (y/y) in December, due to higher world oil prices, peso depreciation, and rising food prices. It is projected to rise further to about 8-8s percent ?he January Consensus projects growth at 3.9 percent in 2000 and 2.9 percent in 2001. 4 Given its dependence on oil imports, the Philippines is among the most vulnerable Asian countries to higher oil prices. Staff estimates suggest that if world oil prices return to the levei reached in mid-2000 (a rise of about $5 per barrel from current levels to $30 per barrel), instead of remaining about current levels in 200 1, GDP growth would be about % percentage point lower, and the direct impact on inflation would be about X-1 percentage point.. If external demand were lower by 3 percent, GDP growth would be 3/4 percentage point lower. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- Box 1. Gauging the Recovery The recovery, although less rapid than ln other countries in the region (see figure below), had been gaining SOI momentum prior to the financial market turmoil in the last quarter of 2000. Real GDP grew by 4% percent (y/y) in the third quarter, led by a rebound in agricultural output from the weather-related weakness in the first quarter. Industrial output began to recover in 1999, and this continued in 2000, underpinned by growth of electronics exports. Growth in services also rebounded in 2000 due to stronger trade activity (associated with agricultural production picking up) and rapid growth in telecommunications services. Consumer demand had also begun to recover. Private consumption grew by 3% percent (y/y) in the third quarter, with sales of cars growing strongly in tbe first three quarters before declining in late 2000 (sales remained about half pre-Asian crisis levels). Investment is showing some signs of bottoming out. Gross investment rose by almost 5 percent in the third quarter (y/y), though in seasonally adjusted terms it fell by 1 percent (q/q). Import growth was weak through mid-year, but jumped in the third quarter, although this was mainly due to higher oil and other raw material imports, with capital goods imports falling by 8 percent (y/y) in October. Employment growth began to recover in 1999, but it slackened in 2000 (especially in the agriculture sector) an was insufficient to reduce unemployment given the growing labor force. The unemployment rate remains about 2% percentage points above pre-crisis levels. While the recovery was thus well underway in the third quarter, with its momentum likely to continue into the fourth quarter, recent events are expected to adversely affect growth in 2001. The worsening of investor confidence caused by the political crisis and higher interest rates are likely to slow growth in early 200 1.

The fiscal slippage that emerged mid-year continued in the second half of 2000, resulting in a much higher deficit than programmed. The NG budget deficit for 2000 reached 4.5 percent of GNP, against a program target of 2.9 percent (Table 2), mainly because of a shortfall in revenue. While part of the continued revenue slippage6 is due to the concentration of growth in the lightly taxed agriculture and electronics sectors, failure to implement planned tax Table l.3.

With the rest of the public sector broadly in balance, the public sector deficit reached 4.6 percent of GNP (against a target of 2.9 percent), and the program limits for the public sector financing requirement were also missed by sizable margins (Tables 3 and 4). 13.

Looking ahead, export growth is expected to slow somewhat, given the softening of world demand for electronics, but imports are expected to remain sluggish until investment recovers. As a result, the current account is expected to remain in surplus in 2001. The outlook for the capital account depends importantly on investor confidence, with portfolio and direct investment likely to remain weak until sentiment improves. 16. Structural reforms regained momentum in early 2000, but progress has slowed. A General Banking Act, Securities Act, and a law liberalizing foreign investment in retail trade were enacted, but power sector reform and a revised BSP Act-after making good progress through Congress-were stalled by the political crisis. Resolving the PNB-the only major bank in serious trouble-has proved difftcult, and while some progress has been made on tax administration reforms, revenue performance continues to disappoint. III. REPORT ON THE POLICY DISZUSSIONS 17. The discussions focused on how economic policy could help contain the fallout from the political crisis, contribute to turning around investor confidence, and sustain the recovery. The authorities and staff broadly agreed that reviving confidence would require-besides resolution of the political crisis-a credible start to fiscal consolidation, clear focus of monetary policy on containing inflation, continued structural reforms, and decisive steps to improve governance. A recurring theme was how to deal with vulnerabilities in the fiscal, banking and external sectors, given the recent turbulence. Because of the deviations from the program (especially in the fiscal area), the sixth and final review of the SBA was not completed and the arrangement lapsed at end-December 2000. The authorities expressed a willingness to engage in Post- Program Monitoring (PPM) and to have the first PPM mission in March/April 2001. Table Il. 1. Phiippipcs: NG Budgd for 2001 A.

Capital Outflows size of outllows Official data imply that the deficit on the capital and financial account balance (including errors and omissions) in 2000 will be about 10 percent of GNP, up from 4 percent in 1999. However, registered capital outflows are modest compared with the current account surplus. Net portfolio outflows are close to 3 percent of GNP, which is smaller than the inflow of medium-term loans (5 percent of GNP) and foreign direct investment (1 percent of GNP). A large part of estimated/apparent capital outflows probably reflect statistical problems, in particular an overestimation of the current account surplus (see Annex VII). St& analysis suggests that net capital outflows in 2000 totaled some 3 percent of GNP-still sizable but far less than the 10 percent in official statistics. Capital Account Risks Overall, the risk of massive capital flight appears limited, although the government is vulnerable to losing its access to foreign financing at reasonable prices, l The risk of a dry-up of foreign finance is higher for government than for the private sector. 9 The rollover risk of private short-term debt appears moderate. Private short-term debt on an original-maturity basis is $8.3 billion, mainly trade credit ($1 billion) and borrowing of commercial banks ($6.6 billion; of which $2.4 billion are intercompany liabilities). The banking sector’s net position is, however, small and constrained by position limits l/; net foreign liabilities of commercial banks in mid-2000 were $3 billion. Short-term debt on a residual-maturity basis is $13.6 billion, but most medium- and long-term debt is owed by the public sector, with private sector debt due in 200 1 estimated at about $2 billion. 9 There is greater-albeit still limited-risk for the public sector. Spreads on Philippine sovereign paper increased sharply (to over 600 basis points at end-2000, from 200 basis points at end-1999), and may rise further depending on domestic as well as external developments. Public sector foreign debt amortization due in 2001 totals $3% billion. l Capital flight could continue on a sizable scale, but it is more likely through non-repatriation of exports proceeds than a large shift from peso to dollars. 9 The risk of a sudden large shift from peso to dollar deposits appears limited. As long as the exchange rate floats, fear of a sudden devaluation would seem unwarranted or self-correcting. The ratio of broad money to reserves has declined sharply in recent years (from over 4 in 1995 to 2 this year) and is lower than in most Asian-crisis countries. 9 The prohibition of bank peso-lending to nonresidents provides some short-term protection against larg-tale speculative attacks. 9 Instead, capital flight could be mainly through non+urrender of export proceeds. Given the relatively large gross flows (gross exports of goods and services plus remittances totaled over $49 billion in 2000), the balance of payments is vulnerable to a sudden decline of these inflows. l/ Banks overall net foreign exchange position is limited to 20 percent of paid-up capitai.

Addressing the chronic weakness of budget revenues, in particular, was identified as the core medium- (in biuionr of pesos) term challenge. l1 There was also a consensus that the budget deficit in 2001 should be contained to around 3-3% percent of GNP (about 1 l/s percent of GNP lower than in 2000), an adjustment that would make a significant start to medium-term consolidation, while avoiding a too sharp correction in view of the risks to the growth outlook.” The staff emphasized the risk that even if the deficit could be contained to around 3-3X percent of GNP, it might be difficult to fmance, given the Na Exwmal fiamtin~ 53.3 20.5 20.5 Na Ocincstic Financing of which: Plivatizatim Non-bank financing Bank fimncinp 102.8 178.0 4.9 5.0 19.2 21.9 78.7 151.0 (ii paznt of GNP) 108.6 5.0 31.9 71.6 NG Bud* finmccing 4.5 5.1 3.3 Na !Amanal financing 1.5 0.5 0.5 Net Lhnwsic RaMciag 2.9 4.6 2.8 of which: Bank financing 2.2 3.8 1.8 recent ad&se shift in market sentiment toward emerging market debt and especially Philippine paper. I3 19. While there was broad agreement on the appropriate deficit target for 2001, opinions dif!fered on how best to achieve it, The staff urged adoption of a strong package of revenue and expenditure measures, totaling almost 2 percent of GNP, as part of a revised 2001 budget. Concrete and lasting measures (including an increase in indirect tax rates and cuts in low priority spending) were needed to make a credible start to fiscal consolidation and minimize the risk of failure once again to meet the fiscal targets. The staff noted that reliance in part on Marcos funds (or tapping other one-time revenue sources, see below) ” The staff assessment of the reasons for the sharp decline in the revenue over the last four years (from 19 percent of GNP in 1996-97 to less than 15 percent of GNP in 2000) includes: (1) structural weaknesses in the tax system, including a wide range of tax exemptions; (2) weak tax administration and governance problems in the Bureau of Internal Revenue; and (3) cyclical factors (lower activity in the more heavily taxed sectors of the economy). l2 This would imply a public sector deficit of about 3% percent of GNP for 2001. I3 The government currently plans to limit recourse to external market financing to about $30b-400 million in 2001. Taking into account projected borrowing from official sources, a NG deficit target of 3.3 percent of GNP would imply domestic bank financing of the NG budget of 1.8 percent of GNP (1 percent of GNP in the case of full receipt of Marcos funds), dompared with 2.2 percent of GNP in 2000.

The authorities considered measures of the kind and magnitude recommended by the staff as neither feasible nor required. Given the political crisis and upcoming elections,14 tax increases were unlikely to find support in Congress. Also, the authorities felt that the staff’s revenue projections were on the pessimistic side. In particular, ongoing efforts to improve tax administration would start to yield better revenue performance next year, and revenue would be boosted by the expected “Marcos funds,” possible sale of third generation telecommunications licenses, and securitization of the government’s share of income from a large natural gas project coming on stream in late 2001. On the expenditure side, the authorities were considering presidential and/or administrative expenditure cuts of up to P 50 billion (1 !A percent of GNP) in order to reach their deficit target.15 The staff cautioned against relying on administrative cuts, given the bad experience with this route in recent yearsi and noted that such cuts would be less transparent than explicit measures in the budget. If recourse was made to administrative cuts, these should be identified at the outset of budget implementation. The authorities agreed, and subsequent to the mission indicated that they were working with Congress to identify possible cuts of low-priority programs in the expenditure budget. The staff will update the Executive Board separately on the status or outcome of these discussions. 21. The authorities reiterated their commitment to fkal consolidation over the medium term. They recognized that their medium-term fiscal program had been overtaken by developments, and were putting together a new program. The overall goal would be to reduce the NG budget deficit to about 1 percent of GNP over the next 3-4 years, mainly by raising revenues. The authorities saw scope for this through reforming the tax system (a study group had been established) and strengthening tax administration under the current action plan. They requested Fund technical assistance in these efforts. The staff welcomed the proposal to reform the tax system and urged a far-reaching revamp of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (Annex IV) within the context of a broader effort to fight corruption. l4 Mid-term elections are to be held in May for the Lower House of Congress and half the Senate. The presidential election is scheduled for 2004. I5 The cuts would focus on new domestically financed capital projects and other low priority outlays. Part of the cuts could be done by using the presidential line item veto, with the rest made through administrative withholding of appropriations. l6 This approach resulted in non-interest spending exceeding budget targets by 0.2 percent of GNP in 2000, despite a commitment to offset revenue shortfalls by withholding appropriations. Also, administrative cuts put in place in early 1998 were largely reversed later in the year. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- 22. Widespread tax incentives are a particular concern as they are eroding the tax base, especially in fast growing sectors such as electronics (Box 3). The staff recommended action to narrow and simplify incentives, limit discretion in administration, and become fully transparent about the costs to the budget. The authorities noted that their recent attempt to reform the system had actually led to pressures for more incentives, and felt that it might be better to tackle this issue again after the elections in 2001. 23. On the expenditure side, the authorities expected significant savings over the medium term in local government (LG) transfers and from wide-ranging public sector reforms. LG transfers, which had risen sharply in recent years, would level off from 2002 onward (given the recent weak performance of domestic taxes to which these transfers are linked). Furthermore, the authorities emphasized the potential savings from planned reorganization of the bureaucracy, which would involve redefining the government’s role in the economy, improving efficiency, and reducing personnel (as laid out in a draft bill before Congress). Significant savings would also accrue from the ongoing reform of government procurement and elimination of ineffective government projects. B. Monetary and Exchange Bate Policy 24. Monetary and exchange rate policy has been complicated by the fiscal slippage and the turbulent market conditions of recent months. The monetary authorities stated that they had faced diffkult choices between (1) allowing the peso to depreciate further, possibly in a free fall, and accepting the inflationary consequences; (2) raising interest rates aggressively to defend against further depreciation, but at the cost of choking off growth; or (3) raising interest rates more moderately to limit the inflationary fallout from the peso, but without attempting to target a Monetary Conditions Index II Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- Box 3. Tax Incentives 11 The Philippines is faced with a difficult policy choice in the area of corporate taxation. On the one hand, revenues as a share of GNP have declined sharply (from 19 percent in 1996 to less than 15 percent in 2000). On the other, the Philippines is operating in a very competitive regional market for foreign direct investment. To remain competitive and to compensate for difficult business conditions in other areas (such as political stability, corruption, infrastructure development, etc.), the Philippines has been led over the years to offer a broad array of fiscal incentives in pursuit of the country’s growth and development goals. While the negative impact of incentives on the revenues can be resolved only over time, some aspects of a reform agenda can be implemented quickly: l In a democratic system, one way to contain the proliferation of tax incentives is to place into the public domain information on the costs and benefits of these incentives, who receives them, and the trade-offs with the provision of other public services. Congress should approve all tax expenditures as part of the annual budget, and reports on expenditures and their economic and social benefits should be published regularly (ex-post); l The administration of incentives needs to be improved through codification of the qualifying criteria and removal of discretion in administrating the programs; l Studies are needed to determine which incentives are truly important for investors (particularly for companies whose home country does not “tax-spare” income earned under a tax holiday in the Philippines) and the likely redundancy rate for Philippine incentives; l Agencies offering incentives need to be held accountable not only for the amount of investments they bring in but also for the fiscal costs of attracting such investments; l The loss carry-forward rules should be amended to allow a reasonable period of loss carry forward for all projects (including those receiving incentives); and l The indirect taxation leakages from the Special Economic Zones need to be eliminated. The necessary fundamental restructuring of the system of incentives requires a well thought out strategic approach. Careful analysis is needed on what the real deficiencies in the investment climate are and whether the statutory tax rates are an important factor in deterring inward investment. If taxes are viewed as a key impediment, the government will need to decide whether to continue offering incentives or instead choose a model of a lower but evenly applied corporate tax rate. If incentives continue to be viewed as a worthwhile tool, the government should: l Ensure that it captures some of the upside potential of profitable projects by using incentives such as investment allowances or accelerated depreciation rates than tax holidays; l Greatly simplify the system of incentives, preferably under one “umbrella law” administered by a single government entity; l Replace indirect tax exemptions with tax refunding which is easier to monitor and prevent abuse; and l Improve the tax administration in order to increase the confidence of potential investors in the tax authorities and reduce investor preference for tax holidays. Finally, there is a clear role for a regional coordination effort to help countries refrain from pursuing this harmful form of tax competition. l!

They had opted for a calibrated tightening of policy interest rates in October (by 400 basis points) to limit the inflationary consequences.17 25. The staff endorsed the BSP’s current approach of focusing monetary policy on the medium-term inflation objective. The policy is not to adjust interest rates aggressively in order to the peg the exchange rate or keep within a short-term inflation objective, but to “weigh” against shocks to the inflation outlook, with a view to maintaining a reasonable medium-term inflation target as the principal nominal anchor. In the recent turmoil in October, the sharp depreciation of the peso gave rise to expectations of further depreciation and higher inflation, and a moderate tightening of interest rate policy was warranted. Since then, the inflation risks have lessened somewhat as the peso has stabilized and world oil prices have fallen, which prompted the BSP to reduce policy interest rates by 250 basis points (reversing more than half the October increase). Looking ahead, the staff and authorities agreed that an inflation target of about 6% percent (y/y) was appropriate for end- 2001, with a further reduction to about 5 percent in 2002.18 While the recent reduction in policy interest rates appears consistent with the inflation objectives, the BSP was prepared to adjust interest rates if the inflation outlook were to change significantly. Moreover, the staff emphasized that in order to implement successful inflation targeting on a lasting basis, monetary policy action needed to be supported by measures that went to the root of the confidence problem, including a strong 2001 budget and implementation of structural reforms. 26. The planned move to formal inflation targeting in 2001 will improve further the consistency and transparency of monetary policy. In response to a query by the staff whether this move should be delayed because of the recent market turbulence, the authorities stated their preference for proceeding as planned (they expect to complete technical preparations in early 2001 and adopt formal inflation targeting by mid-2001). In their view, delayed implementation might hurt the BSP’s credibility given its public commitment to I7 Staff analysis shows that a hike in interest rates would have a more adverse impact on corporate sector debt servicing than a depreciation of the peso (given the relatively low exposure to foreign exchange risk). For instance, a 15 percent depreciation of the peso would increase corporate debt service on foreign-currency denominated debt by about 0.2 percent of GNP annually (given that about two-thirds of the debt is reportedly hedged), whereas a 5 percentage point hike in interest rates (an estimate of what is required to offset the inflationary impact of a 15 percent depreciation) would raise debt service by about 1 percent of GNP annually (as most corporate debt is in pesos, and at floating interest rates). l8 The staff and authorities agreed that in the event of a sharp fall in the peso, the 2001 inflation objective may have to be revised upwards as monetary policy would focus on achieving the inflation target for the following year. Sticking to the short-term target for 2001 might require a sharp hike in interest rates that could severely damage confidence and g0Wtl-l.

It would be made clear to the public at that time that policy would focus on achieving the target in 2002, given the policy horizon of 9-12 months. The staff emphasized that success of the new framework would require sufficient exchange rate flexibility and a lower budget deficit, to ensure dominance of the inflation target. Transparency and accountability measures would also be important (Box 4, and forthcoming selected issues paper). Exchange Rate Policy 27. The staff and authorities broadly agreed on the basic tenets of exchange rate policy: the floating of the peso, the need for a sizable reserve cushion, and the importance of an open exchange and trade system. Against the background of recent developments, the discussions focused on the degree and modalities of BSP intervention in the exchange market, based on a broader analysis of intervention policy in recent years (Box 5, and forthcoming selected issues paper). 28. The authorities felt that recent experience had, once again, vindicated their approach to exchange rate management. They explained that (1) the BSP remained committed to letting the peso find its market level (as shown by the sizable depreciation since mid-1999, and especially in recent months); (2) it would sell foreign exchange as necessary to maintain market liquidity and prevent sharp movements of the peso (without targeting any specific level of the rate); and (3) in case of upward pressure on the peso, the BSP would combine intervention to bolster reserves with allowing appreciation. The staff emphasized that the pace of intervention in September-October ($0.7 billion a month) could not be sustained for very long and that a higher level of reserves was desirable. The authorities noted that intervention had not been large relative to the stock of usable reserves ($14 billion at end-August) and that with the calming of markets in late 2000 they had largely rebuilt their usable reserves (to $13.6 billion by end-2000). The staff agreed that BSP’s management of the October crisis was broadly appropriate, but advised somewhat greater exchange rate flexibility, and less intervention, than had been allowed in the (calmer) preceding months. Staff analysis suggests that the exchange rate is presently about 15-20 percent undervalued from a medium term perspective, suggesting that appreciation of the peso (as well as reserve accumulation) is in prospect once investor confidence returns. lg lg Based on an estimate of the exchange rate that is consistent with the medium-term saving- investment norm (current account deficit) of about 2-3 percent of GNP (adjusted for the statistical understatement of imports and profits and dividends, especially in the electronics sector). The estimate is subject to a wide margin of error given the data problems and the caveats that apply to the medium-term S-I approach (see EBW991118).

Inflation Targeting In January 2000, the Monetary Board of the BSP decided to adopt inflation targeting as the new framework for monetary policy from 2001. The move aims to improve further the consistency and transparency of monetary policy and provide a clearer framework for assessing the impact of domestic and external influences on the inflation outlook. Among the key policy requirements, BSP autonomy appears reasonably assured and the BSP is planning to take several measures to enhance transparency and accountability; however, further efforts are needed to ensure the dominance of the inflation target. 0 The Central Bank Act of 1993 clearly states that the “primary objective of the Bangko Sentral is to maintain price stability conducive to balanced and sustained growth of the economy,” and the BSP has (legal and de-facto) control over the instruments needed to achieve its monetary policy targets; 0 The BSP is planning a range of measures to improve transparency and accountability, including the public release of regular reports to the Monetary Board of the BSP on external, monetary and financial developments; publication of minutes from relevant portions of Monetary Board meetings (with a lag); a quarterly “Inflation Report” and annual reports to Congress; and issuance of an open letter to the President in case of target breach (including an explanation of any policy response). Staff agreed that these measures would enhance transparency and accountability, and suggested that reports to Congress be made every six months rather than annually. 0 Fiscal dominance has not been a major problem since the new central bank was created, as fiscal deficits have been moderate. The recent fiscal slippage has increased the domestic financing requirement of the budget, and unless contained, raises the risk that the BSP could be required to provide direct credit to the NG.’ Therefore, fiscal consolidation is needed to ensure dominance of the inflation target. a Peso stability should not factor as a direct concern for monetary-cum+xchange rate management, implying sufficient exchange rate flexibility and limited BSP foreign exchange intervention (although the exchange rate will remain important through its impact on the inflation outlook). ’ The BSP is not currently providing any direct credit to the NG. However, according to the BSP Act of 1993, emergency credits may be provided from the BSP to the NG, for a maximum of 6 months, not exceeding 20 percent of the average annual income of the last three preceding fiscal years. The authorities stated that it was unclear whether “annual income” would be interpreted as gross revenues, (implying 2% percent of GNP in credit available) or the NG deficit (in which case no financing would be available, as net income is negative).

Philippines: Inflation Targeting (Concluded) The BSP is currently refining the operational framework for inflation targeting, with decisions required, in particular, on who will be responsible for setting the target, the nature of the target, the policy horizon, and whether to have any escape clauses. An external consultant will provide assistance beginning in mid-January. The following preliminary proposals are under consideration: 0 Setting the target would be the joint responsibility of the Government and the BSP, to ensure consistency of macroeconomic policy. The target would be announced along with other macroeconomic objectives of the government. Once the target is set, the BSP would be held responsible for its achievement. l The headline consumer price index would be the ultimate target, with core inflation (excluding food and energy) also of major importance in determining the policy stance. While the headline index includes a food component that comprises 5 1 percent of the basket, targeting non-food inflation might undermine the credibility of the framework if the reasons for the adjustment and the monetary policy reaction are not well understood. 0 The authorities would announce a point target, with a tolerance interval of +/- 1 percentage point. They felt that a wider interval would lack credibility, and noted their plans for escape clauses (see below). The target horizon would be about two years, with announcement of annual average targets, and possibly end-year targets. The authorities are considering a medium-term target in the range of 4-5 percent. 0 The authorities are considering possible escape clauses from the inflation target, including (i) significant peso depreciation; (ii) mortgage interest rates; (iii) significant government policy changes that directly affect prices; (iv) prices of oil products; (v) prices of unprocessed food products; and (vi) natural disasters affecting a major part of the economy. Staff advised against the excessive use of escape clauses, as it would undermine the credibility of the framework. In particular, significant peso depreciation should not be an escape clause, as its use would imply the loss of a nominal anchor to the economy.

Foreign Exchange Market Intervention 1/ In the last two years, the BSP has intervened frequently in the foreign exchange market. In the first half of 1999 the BSP bought foreign exchange as the peso appreciated, but since mid-l 999 the BSP has generally been selling dollars as the peso came under intermittent pressure. BSP policy is not to defend a particular level of the exchange rate, but to prevent sharp fluctuations which it believes would trigger additional demand from corporations and speculators, and thereby exacerbate volatility. The BSP has intervened both in the spot market and through nondeliverable forwards (NDFs). NDFs have been provided by the BSP to cover the exchange rate risk for a commercial bank that agreed to borrow dollars abroad and sell them in the market. Unlike spot intervention, NDFs do not directly affect the stock of official reserves (given that any gain/loss on the exchange rate guarantee involved is settled in pesos). While intervention has been frequent, its scale has typically been limited. In the first half of 1999, the BSP bought some US$2% billion in the market, about half of which it has since sold. The stock of outstanding NDFs has fluctuated up to US% 1 billion (about 7 percent of gross reserves). Intervention has generally not beeu revealed to the public. Spot intervention takes place outside the Philippines’ dealers system, and is not publicly announced, although the market can make inferences from the (published) level of official reserves. NDF intervention is also not announced, and cannot be inferred from the level of reserves. The BSP views intervention through NDFs as a useful tool, because it does not directly commit reserves and it is easier to maintain confidentiality than through spot intervention (i.e., when market participants see commercial banks selling dollars in the market-as a result of an NDF-they are unsure whether it reflects BSP intervention or sales from other sources). Recent theoretical models provide some support for the view that intervention works, and that it might work better if it is done secretly. These models assume that “noise traders” (investors who do not base their decisions on economic fundamentals) may have considerable impact on exchange rate movements. In such models, intervention can be effective, either through reducing the impact of noise traders, or by affecting the perceptions of foreign exchange dealers on the amount of demand for foreign exchange in the market. Although secret intervention migbt be at times more effective in inlluencing the exchange rate, it has also drawbacks. Secrecy removes the discipline on policy that comes from public review and accountability. Secrecy may increase volatility and the country risk premium, because market participants may make wrong conjectures about the actions of the central bank and not believe oMicia1 reserves figures. In order to improve transparency, the BSP has decided to publish the stock of NDFs with a one-month lag from January 2001 (in line with the SDDS template). The one-month lag enables intervention to remain secret for l-2 months, while the increased transparency could reduce the risk premium. The staff considers that the risk premium could also be reduced by the BSP publicly announcing its limit on spot intervention and NDF use, in line with its policy of intervening only to smooth sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than defending a particular rate.

The authorities reiterated their view of non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) as a useful tool for intervention, within reasonable limits. In particular, NDFs did not commit official reserves and could be used more discreetly than spot sales. They recognized the potential pitfalls, such as exchange rate losses of the BSP, which is why the stock of NDFs had been kept well within limits. The staff argued that the main drawback with the BSP’s use of NDFs was the lack of transparency, which lessens the discipline on the BSP to limit the use of NDFs. Hence, staff welcomed the authorities’ decision to publish NDFs, starting in January 2001, in line with the SDDS reserve template (that is, with a one-month lag). On the currency rate protection program (CRPP),20 the authorities explained that it had been revived at the height of recent market pressures to calm corporate demand for debt prepayment; its use has been limited (less than $100 million) probably because of the market-related premium charged. Staff recommended that the scheme be eliminated as soon as possible, and that meanwhile BSP exposure to NDFs should be limited in aggregate (including the CRPP). 30. The BSP has taken several steps in recent months to tighten report@ and compliance rules for capital account transactions (Table II.3). The authorities explained that these measures were part of a wider effort to improve the monitoring of financial transactions and eliminate loopholes used for regulatory arbitrage and speculation. In particular, they pointed to the announcement that (bank-affiliated) foreign exchange corporations would be subject to the same rules as banks themselves,21 the prohibition of “engineered swaps, “zand the increase of reporting for all foreign exchange transactions, as measures that would improve the health of the financial system and help address money- laundering. The staff noted that, in practice, some of the measures did result in reduced freedom of capital movements, even if they were mostly a reaffirmation of existing rules, and that the benefits needed to be weighed against the potential longer term cost.23 The staff also cautioned against steps that might be perceived as a gradual trend toward a tighter system of controls, as this risked exacerbating capital flight. The authorities stressed that the measures were not the start of a tighter regime of controls; reiterated their commitment to an open exchange and trade system; and noted that market reaction to the measures had been benign. *’ Under the CRPP, the BSP provides NDFs (priced on a market basis) to banks who provide forward cover to qualified importers and other fnms with foreign exchange obligations. 21 Since the mid-1990s, foreign exchange corporations (affiliates of commercial banks set up to conduct forex business) had been allowed de facto to operate in a significantly less controlled environment than banks. This has now been largely reversed, reaRirming the regulatory environment for forex corporations as largely the same as that for banks. 22 Fmancial engineering to exploit weaker regulation and lower taxation of foreign exchange versus peso deposits with Philippine banks (see EBS/99/6). 23 Staff confinned that the measures were consistent with Article VIII.

Vulnerability to Shocks and the Medium-Term Outlook 31. While key pillars of stability remain in place, the economy’s vulnerability to shocks has increased in the past year. Strong points include monetary policy focused on the inflation outlook, a flexible exchange rate and an open trade and exchange rate system. The weaknesses, which have been heightened by recent events, are concentrated in the fiscal, banking and external sectors. 32. The chronic weakness of NG revenues and high public debt are sources of vulnerability. The fall in revenue in the past four years, together with peso depreciation, has boosted nonfinancial public sector debt to almost 90 percent of GNP, which is high relative to neighboring countries (Figure 4 and Table 8). These developments severely constrain the scope for expansionary fiscal policy in response to an adverse shock and are a potential source of financial instability (related to difficulties in meeting high financing requirements). The unreformed structure of expenditure, with a high proportion of non-discretionary spending, also limits the scope for fiscal adjustment. 33. The banking system appears fairly stable thanks to past reforms, though vulnerabilities remain and have increased under recent pressures. Commercial banks’ average capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 151% percent remains above the statute (10 percent), reflecting the reported strong capital position of most large banks. 2 norm The ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans has risen moderately in recent months (to 15% percent in October), partly reflecting tighter classification rules and better scrutiny of NPLs for banks that were merged. While this remains below the level in 16 16 neighboring countries (Figure 4), the * 14 recent rise in interest rates and peso depreciation will likely result in further ‘* ’ - I2 upward pressures on NPLs and some IO . - IQ worsening of capital adequacy ratio~.~ -I Recent episodes of deposit withdrawals from several banks (see Annex VI) -6 indicated some fragility of depositor -4 confidence in weaker banks. -““.“....“...‘.....,’ ‘IAN MAY SEP IAN MAY SW JAN NAY SEP IAN NAY SEP 2 1997 1998 I999 2000 24 At end-October, there were two expanded commercial banks (one of which was PNB) with CARS below 10 percent (both, however, were above 8 percent). While prudential indicators in the Philippines suffer from some weaknesses, the staff considers that they provide a broadly accurate picture of the financial condition of the banking system. z On present interest and exchange rates, the authorities project the NPL ratio of commercial banks to peak at some 19-20 percent by mid-200 1. Staff analysis suggests that this would result in a decline in the average CAR by about 1 percentage point.

External sector vulnerability has declined considerably in the past decade, but risks persist. Reserves, exports, and the maturity structure of debt have improved significantly, but external debt has risen, capital outflows have increased, and exports have become concentrated in the electronics sector (see Box 6 and Table 9). Despite the rise in capital outflows, the Philippines does not face significant debt servicing pressures in the near future. Debt service payments are projected at 16 percent of exports in 2001; reserves cover 100 percent of residual-maturity shoe-term debt (or 3.7 months of imports); and the rollover risk for interbank lines appears limited given that net foreign liabilities of commercial banks have declined from $6 billion in 1997 to $3 billion in 2000. Obligations to the Fund are also small relative to exports (repurchases and charges are projected at 0.2 percent of exports in 200 1, and to peak at 1 percent of exports in 2003, Table 10). 35. Prospects for reducing the economy’s vnlnerabilities over the medium-term depend on progress with implementing sound policies (Annex V). Assuming that fiscal consolidation starts in 2001, supported by successful inflation targeting and structural reforms, growth would be expected to pick up toward a potential rate of about 5 percent, and public and external debt decline to more prudent levels, thereby reducing the economy’s vulnerability. An alternative scenario that assumes continued policy drift, with little progress on fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, would result in higher debt, lower growth and investment, and higher inflation, all of which would increase the vulnerability of the Philippines to adverse shocks. Iv. STRUCTURAL REFORM!3 36. Beyond the unfinished agenda from the SBA program, the discussion covered the authorities’ medium-term strategy to achieve sustained high growth, lessen external vulnerability, and reduce poverty. The authorities and staff agreed that completing the outstanding reform agenda was critical to turning around investor confidence and that continued reforms across a broad front were necessary (Table IV. 1). However, the authorities also noted the political constraints which precluded rapid progress in many areas at present. A. Banking 37. While acknowledging the good progress made on banking reforms, the staff emphasized that further steps were needed to build a more robust and efficient banking system (see Annex VI). The discussion focused on PNB’s problems, implementation of the new legal framework for banks, and issues surrounding resolution of failed banks, deposit secrecy, protection of supervisors from litigation, and money-laundering. 38. PNB remains an important source of vulnerability, given the weak financial condition of this systemic bank. At end-September 2000, PNB reported an NPL ratio of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - Box 6. External Vulnerability The external position has strengthened since 1997, but some tierabilities remain. On the positive side: l Offkial reserves have almost doubled to about 100 percent of short-term debt. l Export growth has been strong, with electronics exports having surged from US$2 billion in 1990 to US$25 billion in 1999. Growth continued in early 2000, but began to weaken in the second half of the year. l The maturity structure of external debt has improved and the share of short-term debt relative to GDP is lower than in some other countries heavily affected by the Asian crisis (see table below). However, a number of risks remain in the external sector: External debt has risen since the onset of the Asian crisis and is higher than in some other neighboring countries. (The net present value of external debt is estimated to be about 2 percentage points of GNP lower than the nominal value, as only a small proportion of debt is on concessional terms.) Despite the improvement in the offkial reserve position, reserve coverage is less than in some other countries in the region-relative to both imports and short-term debt. Export growth is heavily concentrated in electronics, making the country vulnerable to sudden shifts in demand and investment preferences in this rapidly evolving sector. Sizable capital outflows in 1999-2000 indicate some vulnerability to further shocks to investor confidence, although the scope for sudden massive capital flight appears limited (see Box 2).

The majority of undercapitalized banks are in merger negotiations or have committed to downgrade licenses. Good progress made, with restructured loans retaining nonaccrual status until a track record is established and enhanced reporting of foreign exchange maturity mismatches.

After long delays, an injection of fresh capital was made in September, but privatizatlon and rehabilitation plans are still to be worked out.

Philippines: Stand-By Arrangement - Progress on Structural Reforms Main Objectives (established in EBS/WSO) Electric Power Sector Reform status . Comprehensive restructuring of the electric power sector, to overcome the gross inefficiencies in the sector and address the precarious financial situation of the National Power Corporation (NPC). The reform aims at privatizing the NPC, eliminating its monopoly, and creating open access transmission and distribution systems. Trade Liberalization 0 Push ahead with trade liberalization, including by reducing the maximum tariff to 65 percent in 1999. Average tariffs are expected to have been reduced to about 9 percent in 2000. 0 Open up the retail sector and investment houses to foreign investment. Enhance tbe Corporate Sector Regulatory Framework . Strengthen Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) policies and procedures for debt restructuring . Prepare new bankruptcy law l Strengthen monitoring and disclosure of corporate finances The Lower House of Congress passed the Electricity Industry Reform Act in April 2000, while the Senate passed similar legislation in June. Final passage of the law still pending. The maximum tariff was reduced to 65 percent in July 1999, and temporary tariffs introduced on select items in early 1999 were removed at end-1999. Average tariffs were reduced to 8.2 percent by end-2000. An anti-dumping law was passed in August 1999 to bring procedures into line with the WTO. Retail trade sector liberalization was approved in March 2000. The new General Banking Act allowed 100 percent foreign investment in the banking sector. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published revised “Rules of Procedure on Corporate Recovery”, but they contain some shortcomings, including a lack of formal protection of secured creditors’ rights during the period of suspension of payments. A draft insolvency law has been submitted to Congress. A new Securities Act was passed in July 2000. The law updates the legal framework to modem standards, including tighter disclosure rules and regulatory oversight by the SEC. It also transferred the SEC’s judicial powers to the courts. Partly in response to a high profile insider trading, steps are being taken to improve the governance of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE). The new Securities Act mandates the demutualization of the PSE within one year to ensure effective governance. Other measures include placing a majority of nonbrokers on the PSE governing board and improving its compliance enforcement and surveillance capabilities.

Following a capital injection in October, the CAB is reported at 8% percent. PNB currently accounts for about 6 percent of banking system deposits, has a large branch network (including in outlying areas), and serves as the main commercial bank of the government. 39. Efforts to resolve PNB have continued to run into difficulties. From the start, the authorities did not consider closure as an option, given the bank’s systemic importance. The original plan in 1998 was to sell it to a strategic investor, who would then rehabilitate the bank. However, implementation of the plan was hampered by protracted delays with an external audit and the acquisition of a majority stake by a local business group in a transaction clouded by governance problems (see EBS/OO/136). In June 2000, when the bank’s CAR had fallen to -0.2 percent, agreement was reached with the majority owner to purchase the government’s remaining 30 percent stake and inject at least P 10 billion of capital by end-September. Subsequent uncertainty about the owner’s commitment to comply with this agreement led to a deposit run in early October, triggering emergency advances totaling P 25 billion (0.7 percent of GNP).26 The bank was eventually recapitalized (with P 10 billion in fresh capital from the majority owner), but only after the government promised financial support in rehabilitating the bank. The government’s stake was not sold. 40. The rehabilitation plan has not yet been fmalized. PNB has requested that the emergency assistance be converted into a long-term loan on concessional terms to support the bank’s long-term profitability. The authorities said they would try to minimize additional concessions, but that some official support was warranted, together with further capital injections from the private owners, to assure sustained rehabilitation of the bank. The staff advised against converting emergency assistance into a (subsidized) long-term loan and recommended tightly circumscribing any future assistance. In particular, the BSP should transparently analyze the financial condition of the PNB and the resulting need, if any, for further liquidity support and/or additional capital injections. While liquidity should be provided by BSP/PDIC as needed-in line with existing regulations-capital support was up to the owners of the bank. If govemmeut decided to participate in capital support, this should be done transparently and with government gaining full shareholder rights. 41. The staff welcomed the progress with banking legislation, while noting that challenges remain. Following passage of the new General Banking Act and Securities Act (see EBS/00/136), the amended BSP Act and a new Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) charter are also well advanced in Congress. Together with a wide range of new regulations adopted over the past few years, these laws will provide a sound regulatory framework. The challenge now is to implement the new framework and upgrade supervisory skills and practices. 26 Comprising P 15 billion in liquidity support from the BSP and P 10 billion from Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC); the latter was financed by a loan from the BSP.

Key outstanding reform issues include the bank resolution process, deposit secrecy, protection of supervisors from litigation, and money-laundering. While progress has been made in streamlining the resolution process and the BSP has handled recent (small) bank failures well, the BSP/govemment still lack appropriate instruments to intervene in a bank that has failed but should not be closed (for systemic reasons). Currently, rehabilitation of a failed bank requires the owners’ consent. However, the ability of government to take over and restructure an insolvent bank without shareholders’ consent is critical to the resolution of systemic banks. Regarding bank secrecy, the authorities pointed to the proposed changes in connection with money-laundering (see below), but explained that a more far-reaching relaxation was not feasible at present. While the draft new PDIC charter proposes upgrading of protection for PDIC staff against litigation, the draft amendments to the BSP Act do not include such provisions. 43. Several steps have been taken to counter money laundetig, but further action is needed. In April 2000, the Philippines was listed as a “non-cooperative country” by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on money laundering mainly because of its strict bank secrecy provisions, the absence of “know your customer rules,” and lack of legislation criminalizing money laundering. Since then, the Philippines has introduced a number of administrative measures (Box 7), but legislative changes remain pending. One of the amendments proposed in the BSP Act would allow supervisors to inspect deposits above P 50 million (about $1 million) in case of suspicion of fraud or other irregularity. 44. The authorities agreed that after the intense reforms and changes in recent years, it would be useful to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the financial system and its regulatory framework. Although they expressed concern about the excessive workload for supervisory staff and wondered about the safeguards to protect confidential information, they agreed, on a preliminary basis, to participate in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), to be completed in the context of the 2002 Article IV consultation. The exercise is to be phased, with some elements-possibly market liquidity issues-to be conducted in the second half of 2001. B. Power Sector 45. Power sector reform legislation, while well advanced, remains to be enacted.27 Although legislation has passed both houses of Congress, the two versions have yet to be reconciled. Final approval was held up earlier this year by the need for further technical analysis of the privatization of the National Power Corporation (NPC), and more recently by the political crisis. Important issues to be resolved include the assumption of NPC debt by the 27 tie AsDB has been taking the lead in this area, under a Power Sector Reform Loan (with passage of appropriate legislation as a condition for the second tranche of the loan). Because of the importance for sustained growth, fiscal sustainability, and investor confidence, progress with power sector reform also formed part of conditionality under the SBA.

The Philippines’ Anti-Money Laundering Efforts In June 2000, the Philippines was one of the fifteen countries listed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as non-cooperative in the fight against money laundering. The main weaknesses cited by the FATF were the bank secrecy provisions in Philippine law (a long-standing concern of Fund advice) and lack of (1) legislation criminalizing money laundering, (2) regulations requiring customer identification and record keeping, and (3) a system for reporting suspicious transactions by financial institutions. Prior to being listed by the FATF as non-cooperative, a number of efforts were underway to address money laundering: l A Presidential Task Force Against Organ&d Crime was created, and the National Drugs Law Enforcement Coordinating Center and the Philippine Center on Transnational Crime were established. l The Bankers Association of the Philippines established a Workgroup on Money Laundering and circulated Know your Customer Guidelines to its members. l In April 2000, the Philippines submitted to the FATF a self-assessment on compliance with the Forty Recommendations for effective anti-money laundering measures. l The Philippines is a member of, and currently co-chairs, the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering. l Four bills covering different aspects of anti-money laundering were submitted to Congress. Since being listed by the FATF’s as non-cooperative, several measures have been taken: l The BSP has issued circulars embracing the FATF’s recommendations on customer identification, record keeping, reporting of suspicious transactions, and internal policies, procedures and controls. l The BSP has required banks to submit action plans for dealing with suspicious transactions, and a number of them have complied. l To address bank secrecy, a proposed amendment to the BSP Act would give BSP examiners access to deposits of at least P 50 million (about $1 million) believed to be used in relation to fraud or irregularity, l The BSP has also established a Special Committee to evaluate and investigate suspicious transactions and plans to create a database of reported suspicious transactions. Notwithstanding the above initiatives, more needs to be done to comply with the FATF recommendations. l Comprehensive anti-money laundering legislation is required, instead of the four bills currently before Congress. This legislation should incorporate f%lly the recommendations of the FATF and the Base1 Committee on money laundering and include “Proceeds of Crime” and other complementary provisions. l The bank secrecy law needs to be amended, going beyond the proposed amendment to the BSP Act. The authorities should have ready access to details of depositor names and records so that all suspected cases of fraudulent activity can be properly investigated. l The BSP needs to develop appropriate skills for reviewing and processing the reports of suspicious transactions, and strengthen coordination with other enforcement agencies to facilitate the investigation of reported suspicious transactions.

The authorities reiterated their hope for passage of legislation before Congress is dissolved for the May elections (otherwise, the legislative process would need to restart from scratch in the new Congress). 46. Reform is particularly urgent for the NPC, given the precarious state of its finances, with negative net worth estimated at about $8 billion. The planned transfer of much of NPC’s debt to the NG would remedy the situation for NPC but not for the public sector. The staff urged that this transfer not be the occasion for an immediate reduction of electricity tariffs, given the need for fiscal consolidation (such a reduction should only come over time as a result of true efficiency gains in the power sector). The authorities noted that legislative approval of the reforms may not be possible without some reduction in tariffs. C. Corporate Sector 47. The new Securities Act provides a modern legal framework for capital markets. The transfer of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) quasi-judicial functions to the courts requires implementing rules and a new insolvency law. The authorities are working on those rules, and a new insolvency law was recently submitted to Congress.28 48. Progress has been made in strengthening governance at the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) and preparing for its legally-mandated demutualization. The SEC had removed the PSE’s self-regulatory status in April, following an insider-trading scandal, and conditioned reinstatement on a number of reforms. Following the establishment of a majority of non-brokers on the PSE Board in August, the PSE regained its self-regulatory status in September. The PSE is now on track toward demutualization by mid-2001, ahead of the August 2001 date required by the new Securities Regulation Code. D. Trade Reform 49. Continued progress with trade reform is necessary to boost economic growth.29 The authorities confirmed that they would keep with previous commitments to reduce tariffs reduction within ASEAN, although the specific annual path toward the agreed medium-term goals might be slightly backloaded in 2001. The staff welcomed the authorities’ resistance against pressures to re-regulate industries, as for example under recent proposals for a “National Oil Exchange,“30 and advised that the new Safeguards Measures Act be used only 28 The World Bank, AsDB, and IMF Legal Department provided comments on the draft insolvency law, which the authorities are incorporating into a revised draft. 29 Staff analysis shows that the reduction of protection since the 1980s contributed O-2-0.7 percentage points to Philippine growth (see IMF Occasional Paper No. 187). XJ The proposal-which did not proceed-was to establish centralized government control of oil procurement, a major step backwards from oil sector deregulation (passed in 1998).

The staff also recommended converting quantitative restrictions on agricultural imports into tariffs, and scaling back the high protection levels for selected agricultural products.31 E. Labor Market 50. High unemployment in the Philippines arises from a combination of slow economic growth and rapid population growth. The Philippine unemployment rate averaged 10% percent in 1999/2000,2-3 times the rate in other ASEAN countries. While employment growth was strong relative to neighboring countries in the 199Os, it was not fast enough to lower unemployment as the labor force grew by about 2% percent annually. ’ Analysis by the staff shows that the slow employment growth can largely be attributed to slow real GDP growth rather than other factors such as wage rates (see forthcoming selected issues paper). The analysis suggests that the key to reducing unemployment is to foster economic growth, through sound macroeconomic and structural policies, while ensuring that the real minimum wage does not increase faster than labor productivity. 51. The authorities have also identified a number of weaknesses in the labor code and industrial relations, with reforms now under consideration. The weaknesses include: some lack of flexibility in working hours (currently restricted to five eight-hour days a week) and an overly legalistic approach to resolving labor disputes. A Congressional committee is working on recommendations for reform in these areas. F. Statistical and Other Issues 52. Sizable statistical discrepancies have emerged in the national accounts and balance of payments data, suggesting serious problems in the quality of the statistics that hamper analysis. The staff considers that official data in recent years have likely understated real GDP growth and overstated the current account surplus (see paragraph 15). The staff recommended an action plan to improve the quality of these statistics (Annex VII). The authorities reiterated their commitment to address these problems, noting their efforts in this area over the past few years (with Fund technical assistance) and the recent steps to improve the monitoring of capital account transactions. 53. Ratification of the 4& amendment to the Articles of Agreement is still being considered by the Senate. 31 The trade regime is relatively open, with an average tariff of 8 percent (although the maximum tariff is 65 percent, which applies to agricultural products) and a current rating on the Fund’s index of trade restrictions of 4, on a scale of l-10 (with 1 the most liberal, and 10 the most restrictive score).

Following expiration of the SBA at end-2000, outstanding Fund credit to the Philippines is equivalent to 177 percent of quota, which under the recently adopted guidelines on Post-Program Monitoring triggers a presumption of PPM For this reason, the staff recommends that the Philippines engage in PPM by the Fund of economic developments and policies in the period after expiration of the arrangement. The authorities expressed a willingness to maintain a close policy dialogue with the Fund under PPM, and agreed that it would be desirable to base PPM on an agreed set of key economic objectives and policies for the year ahead, to ensure a forward looking aspect to the monitoring, The main issues that would be monitored under PPM are summarized in Box 8. The first staff visit under PPM could take place in March/April 2001. 55. Parallel with PPM, the authorities agreed that it would be useful for the Phiippines to partake in the Fund’s new surveillance activities. Over the next two years, these could include: 0 the initiation of a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2001, to be completed in 2002. l A fiscal transparency module of the Review of Standards and Codes, in July 2001. l A technical assistance cooperation plan for the next 2-3 years. V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 56. Economic performance during 2000 has been mixed. Growth likely reached more than 4 percent, inflation has been low (albeit rising), and the current account surplus remained sizable. However, already weak investor confidence suffered a further blow from fiscal slippages and the political crisis that erupted in October. The ensuing financial market turmoil has dimmed growth prospects for next year. In addition, the international environment has become less favorable, with high oil prices, slowing external demand, and wider spreads on emerging market debt. 57. Although the economy retains key pillars of stability, its vulnerability to shocks has increased. Prime among the economy’s strong points are monetary policy focused on the inflation outlook; a flexible exchange rate; and an open trade and exchange system. The main elements of weakness, heightened by recent developments, are the growing fiscal deficit; PNB’s problems; capital outflows; and high public and external debt. 58. . Fiscal adjustment is urgent given the immediate financing constraints, the need to restore market confidence, and the medium-term concerns of high public debt, chronically weak revenues, and an increasingly rigid expenditure structure. The staff urges that a package of lasting measures be adopted to reduce the NG deficit to about 3% percent of GNP in 2001. This would limit the burden on monetary policy and make a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - Box 8. Key Issues for Post-Program Monitoring MA~RoEcoNoMI~I~~~ Progress on fiscal consolidation. Credible consolidation will require concrete and lasting measures to reduce the fiscal deficit. To address the chronic weakness of revenues, progress is needed on: tax administration (including governance at the Bureau of Internal Revenue); some new tax measures; and reducing tax incentives. Further efforts are needed to reform the government bureaucracy. Maintenance of a monetary policy stance consistent with the medium-term inflation objective. To ensure success of the inflation targeting framework, further efforts are needed to ensure dominance of the inflation target (including by limiting domestic financing of the budget, especially from the BSP). Continued exchange rate flexibility, by limiting foreign exchange intervention to smoothing sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate and maintaining an open trade and exchange regime. Some appreciation of the peso should be allowed, together with reserve accumulation, to reduce vulnerability when investor confidence returns. BANKINGSECTORIWJES Further progress in establishing a sound regulatory framework through proposed amendments to the BSP Act and PDIC charter, together with implementing tbe new supervisory framework and close monitoring of weaker banks. Also, the BSP’s powers to resolve a failed bank should be further strengthened; supervisory staff, better protected from litigation, and supervisory skills and practices further improved. Progress in rehabilitating PNB. Any future public assistance to the bank should be tightly circumscribed. OTHERSTRUCWRALLSSUES Progress on power sector reform, including final passage of pending legislation and implementation of the reforms. Continued corporate sector reforms, including passage of a new insolvency law and demutualization of the PSE. Further reduction of import tariffs and of protection in the agriculture sector. Labor market reforms aimed at increasing labor flexibility and smoothing the resolution of labor disputes. STATISTICALISSUES Progress in resolving the statistical problems in the national accounts and balance of payments.

In view of the poor experience with administrative cuts in recent years, it would be preferable to have the necessary measures transparently approved by Congress, in a revised budget that contains fully updated and realistic revenue, expenditure, and financing projections. If that cannot be achieved, expenditure cuts through line item veto would be preferable to administrative cuts, followed by a strong package of legislative measures presented to the new Congress after the election. Reliance on one-time revenues such as the “Marcos funds” should be avoided, given that their availability is uncertain and the importance of lasting fiscal adjustment. 59. The chronic weakness of revenues needs fundamental remedy if medium-term f=al consolidation is to be achieved. This will require better tax administration-in an environment of improved governance overall-as well as some tax measures and reforms. The initiatives in tram at the BIR will help, but need to be followed by a more comprehensive effort to improve governance in tax administration. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to review the tax code, and urges that tax incentives be rationalized. 60. The staff supports the current approach to monetary policy and the intention to formally adopt inflation targeting. In order to achieve the targeted decline of inflation in the second half of 2001, the BSP should keep the inflation and fiscal outlook under close review, and adjust interest rates without hesitation if necessary. The authorities’ intention to formally adopt inflation targeting by mid 2001 should improve the consistency and transparency of monetary policy. To be successful it needs to be supported by fiscal consolidation and continued exchange rate flexibility. 61. The authorities’ continued commitment to the basic tenets of exchange rate policy-the floating of the peso, a sizable reserve cushion, and an open exchange and trade system-are welcome. BSP’s management of the October crisis was broadly appropriate, though somewhat greater exchange rate flexibility, and less intervention, would have been advisable in the (calmer) preceding months. Staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to publish non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) with a one-month lag, resulting in full compliance with the SDDS reserve template. 62. While tighter reporting and compliance rules for capital account transactions will improve monitoring and help close regulatory loopholes, the benefits need to be weighed against the potential costs. The measures have resulted in less freedom of capital movement, even if they were mainly a reaffiition of existing rules. Staff welcomes the authorities’ indication that these measures were not the start of a tighter regime of controls. 63. The banking system remains fairly stable overall, but vulnerabilities persist and have recently increased. While most large banks appear healthy and able to withstand additional shocks, the deteriorating economic environment will expose the weaker banks to increasing risk of failure-calling for continued close supervision by the BSP. Moreover, the PNB remains a major concern. Staff welcomes the progress made in recapitalizing PNB, but regrets that this came only after a run on deposits had forced emergency lending and a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4l- promise of concessional public support. Staff recommends against converting emergency assistance into a long-term loan on concessional terms and advises tightly circumscribing any future public assistance to PNB. 64. The progress made on key banking legislation is welcome, but more is still needed. The new General Banking Act and proposed amendments to the BSP Act and PDIC charter will provide a sound regulatory framework. The challenge now is to implement this new supervisory framework and fin&x upgrade supervisory skis and practices. Also, additional legislation is needed to better protect supervisory staff from litigation and to strengthen the BSP’s powers in resolving a failed bank. 65. The momentum of structural reform in other areas needs to be regained in order to boost investor confidence and raise growth prospects. Passage of power sector legislation-seen by investors as a litmus test of the government’s commitment to reform-is crucial to resolve NPC’s financial problems and boost efficiency in the sector. The passage of the Securities Act is welcome, but a new insolvency law is needed. Recent reforms of PSE governance are also welcome, and staff supports plans to demutualize the PSE. The intention to press ahead with previous commitments to tariff reductions within ASEAN should help underpin growth. In addition, the staff recommends scaling back protection in the agriculture sector. Reforms under consideration in the labor market will also help growth prospects. 66. The sizable statistical problems in the national accounts and balance of payments statistics seriously hamper analysis. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to address these weaknesses as soon as possible. 67. It is recommended that the Philippines be subject to Post-Program Monitoring (PPM), in light of the amount of Fund credit currently outstanding and the need to ensure a continued close policy dialogue with the Fund. In addition, an FSAP will provide a good opportunity to take stock of the financial system, and a fiscal transparency module of the Review of Standards and Codes will help assess current practice against international norms. 68. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Phiippines be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The 26 projects include one Montreal Protocol and the 2 GEF-financed projects with total commitments of $36 million. By sector, rural development projects continue to constitute the largest share (3 1 percent), followed by infrastructure projects (27 percent), human development (15 percent), energy (11 percent), and others/adjustment loans (16 percent). The WI3 has been involved in a number of economic and sector studies to help define development issues and sector assistance strategies. Studies in FYOO include: Social and Structural Review, Poverty Assessment, Combating Corruption in the Philippines, Rural Power Sector Study, Rural Development and Natural Resource Management Trends and Strategy Implementation Note, and Environment Monitor. Studies expected to be completed in FYOl include a Country Economic Memorandum and a Filipino Report Card on Government Pro-Poor Services. The World Bank is also undertaking the CAS Mid-term review this FY. In keeping with the World Bank’s Knowledge Sharing initiative, the Bank has developed an enhanced external country web site and Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) activities are under discussion with the World Bank Institute (WBI).

Technical Assistance The World Bank continues to provide technical assistance (TA) to the Philippines through its standard lending operations and trust funded activities. In addition, the Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) Grant Facility has helped in the preparation of several lending operations, as well as in the provision of TA to strengthen the financial sector. TA for capacity building initiatives is also being provided through the Institutional Development Fund (IDF) and the Bank-managed ASEM Trust Fund’. Under ASEM, eight activities have so far been approved (of which two have now been completed) to address crisis-related needs in the social and financial sectors. A new grant facility - Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) - was launched in Tokyo in June 2000. Under this facility, Japan is providing grant funding, managed by the World Bank, to support activities that address the social consequences of the financial crisis. During the first round in June 2000, two proposals for the Philippines were approved. D. Aid Consultative Group The twenty-third meeting of the Consultative Group was held on June 19-20,200O in the Philippines. The World Bank co-chaired the meeting with the Philippine Government, which hosted a CG for the fast time. The Social and Structural Review, Combating Corruption in the Philippines and (draft) Poverty Assessment Reports were distributed and discussed at this meeting. Overall, the donors expressed their support to the Government’s development program and indicated a level of assistance of $2.6 billion for the Philippines for 2000. In recognition of the Mindanao situation, the donors pledged $361 million (out of the $2.6 billion) for Mindanao development.

This prompted the authorities to pursue an action plan to strengthen tax administration reforms as part of the 1998 SBA program. At that time, five key problems were identified: l Major problems with taxpayer compliance and widespread corruption; l Lack of implementation of the large taxpayer initiative launched in the early 1990s; l Weak enforcement and collection of assessed liabilities; l Limited control over refunds and the granting of tax credit certificates; and l Lack of an effective information system. Progress 1998-99 Initially, progress on implementing the Bureau of Internal Revenue’s (BIR) reform program fell short of expectations. During the first year of the SBA, key institutional changes to increase the control over large taxpayers and to strengthen the BIR’s audit program were not made. In addition, planned improvements to the design of tax returns, increased computerization, and the introduction electronic filing systems-which had been in the pipeline for a number of years-did not materialize. Finally, the government continued the practice of offering tax amnesties which collected little revenue and undermined the credibility of the BIR’s collection activities. Progress in 2000 However, with a new Commissioner and a renewed impetus to reform, significant changes have been made during 2000. The centerpiece of the reform package has been the establishment of a large taxpayer service (LTS) at the Bureau of Internal Revenue’s (BIR) headquarters. At present, the service is almost fully staffed and covers 633 taxpayers (accounting for around one-third of total BIR revenue) which closely follows the revised timetable established at the time of the last Article IV consultation. In addition to the headquarters office, the BIR is also in the process of establishing regional large taxpayer bureaus, the first of which is now operational covering 200 taxpayers. The BIR plans to open another three district offices by end-2001. Recently, the BIR has merged the excise taxpayer service into the LTS in order to improve efficiency (by merging units that carry out common functions) and place the main domestic revenue generators under one roof. In addition to establishment of the LTS; the BIR has enhanced its audit and enforcement program and reinvigorated implementation of its program of computerization. The BIR has introduced a broad range of audit checking activities and is improving the targeting of audits to focus on the major areas of risk. As part of audit and investigation activities, there has been an effort to use more effectively available information and conduct third-party Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - ANNEX IV income verification checks. The computerization of BIR activities has included the automation of taxpayer registration, returns processing, taxpayer profiling, audit selection, collection activities and bank reconciliation. The current priority in this area is to develop and implement systems for automatic data capture. Finally, to improve the quality and integrity of BIR staff, a law is pending in Congress to provide performance incentives for tax administrators. This “lateral attrition law” allows BIR management to reassign or even fire staff whose collection activities are shown to perform below expectations. On the other hand, monetary incentives are provided to those BIR staff members whose collections exceed program targets. While these programs are welcome and give BIR management greater flexibility in managing its workforce, over time, staff should be judged increasingly by a comprehensive assessment of their professional competencies, and not just by the Peso revenue they generate. A Broader Program of Reforms? Given the seriousness of the revenue decline in recent years, a wider program of reforms will be needed over the medium term. Such a program could draw substantially from the World Bank’s study of corruption’ with a broad objective of building a professional tax administration that is better skilled, has higher standards of ethical conduct, is appropriately equipped, and has proper rewards and incentives for staff. a In order to depoliticize the revenue collection process, the authorities should consider establishing an oversight board for the BIR made up of appropriately qualified individuals from the public and private sectors. Such a board could help improve the transparency of the tax administration and increase accountability. Such a model has worked effectively in Singapore. l The rolling expectation of future tax write-offs, write-downs and negotiable tax payments has led to a taxpayer perception that it always pays to delay paying taxes. This has eroded the credibility of the tax administration as the enforcer and collector of the assessed statutory liability. To encourage compliance, the government should put an end to all amnesty-type arrangements including those implicit in the Compromise Tax Settlement Program. a Increased computerization of BIR routine activities should free-up staff for more value-adding work (such as taxpayer service and audit and investigation activities) while at the same time allowing the BIR to downsize to a smaller network of offices and staff. Consideration may also be given to privatizing some of the functions of the BIR (such as information technology operations and support). ’ See Philippines: Combating Corruption in the Philippines, May 2000. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-63 - ANNEX IV 0 The BIR should also take measures to improve internal governance such as through improvements in taxpayer rights (perhaps through an explicit statutory code of taxpayer rights and responsibilities), introduction of a strict ethical code-of-conduct for tax officials, improvements in taxpayer service delivery (such as establishing a complaints resolution service with the ability to deal with administrative complaints), and rotation of the regional and district office heads.

The alternative is one of weak economic growth and heightened fiscal and external vulnerabilities. The macroeconomic framework under strong policies shows growth rates rising to potential, increasing investment, the fiscal deficit returning to more moderate levels, and a reduction in debt (public and external) to more manageable levels (Table V. 1): a Growth would reach potential, estimated at around 5 percent (giving per capita growth of 2-3 percent per year). These estimates are based on a growth accounting regression result which quantifies the impact of policy variables on output growth, as well as net foreign direct investment.’ While policy reforms would take some time to show effects, a strong reform package adopted by a committed and decisive government would go a long way towards boosting investor confidence, and attracting needed inflows to finance investmen?. 0 The fiscal deficit in 2001 should be contained to about 3% percent of GNP, making a credible start to medium-term consolidation. In addition, strong measures are needed to enhance the revenue effort (including a broad review of tax and fiscal incentive policies), and non-productive expenditures should be rationalized (including through re-engineering the government bureaucracy). l Such fiscal policies would allow for much-needed public investment (particularly in the more productive areas of infrastructure, and social expenditures to boost human capital) and a reduction in interest expenses. However, the assumption of contingent liabilities may increase year.3 the interest burden of the NG by % - % percent of GNP per ’ See Occasional Paper 187, Policy influences include trade openness (measured by export and import duty ratios), public consumption, education indicators, and other variables. ’ The return of investor confidence and capital inflows should also result in some nominal appreciation of the exchange rate in 2001. Beginning in 2002, the real exchange rate is assumed to be constant. In addition, interest rates are assumed to decline somewhat in 2001 and 2002, and remain stable thereafter. 3 The contingent liabilities assumed include the assumption of debt from the National Power Corporation (as a result of power sector reform) and potential bank restructuring costs totahng P330 billion in 2000. The effect of this assumption are included as a memo item in (continued) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-65 - ANNEX V 0 In addition, a strengthened fiscal position would reduce the economy’s vulnerability to shocks and allow nonfinancial public sector debt to decline to around two thirds of GNP by 2005. 0 With a projected decline in private savings (from the extraordinary increase in recent years) largely offset by higher public savings, robust increases in investment would be matched by a shift in the external current account balance back into deficit (consistent with medium-term saving-investment norms).4 l Inflation could be brought down to about 4 percent by 2005 following the adoption of inflation targeting and a strong package of supporting policies. Prospects for the medium-term would be much weaker if focal policies continue to drift and structural reforms are not undertaken (Table V.2): 0 Growth rates would not likely increase significantly from the projected 2001 level (barely sustaining current levels of per capita GNP), and investment would decline as confidence remains low. With such weak prospects, access to international capital markets would remain relatively expensive as the country risk premium stays high’. 0 With no reforms taking place, the fiscal position would be significantly worse, with deficits remaining at 5-6 percent of GNP throughout the period. l More productive public investment expenditures would be crowded out by rising interest expenses, increasing fiscal vulnerability to shocks as the share of non- discretionary expenditures increases further. l With such high deficits, there would little reduction in public debt, exacerbating vulnerabilities. Table V. 1, but not in the total deficit, in contrast to the inclusion of these contingent liabilities in EBS/OO/136. 4 The scenario projects the measured surplus to decline from 10% percent of GNP in 2000 to 5 % percent in 2005. Excluding the estimated overstatement of the current account surplus the “true” current account would move from a present surplus of about 3-5 percent of GNP to a deficit of 2-3 percent of GNP in 2005 (see Annex VII). ’ This scenario assumes a constant real exchange rate, from end 2000, with interest rates staying three percentage points higher than in the previous scenario. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 66 - AN-NEXV 0 The external current account would remain in surplus, as investment stays sluggish and both public and private saving decline. - a Inflation would likely be high in this scenario, reflecting the absence of further reform to open the economy up to domestic and foreign competition, as well as the pressure on monetary aggregates from the higher fiscal deficit.

A wide range of reforms implemented over the past several years have added to the resilience of the system and improved the BSP’s supervisory capacity. The capital adequacy of commercial banks (which account for 91 percent of total banking system assets), while still well above the statutory rninim~~ has declined in recent months from 16.4 percent in June to 15.5 percent in September 2000, mainly because of an increase in risk assets brought on by a rise in nonperforming assets (NPAs).’ Commercial bank’s nonperforming loans (NPLs) have inched upward, from 14.6 percent in June to 15.6 percent in October 2000, reflecting a tightening of classification rules, a better scrutiny of NPLs for banks that were merged, and the slow pace of loan restructuring following the Asian crisis. Over the same period, bank profitability has fallen as asset quality deteriorated. The liquidity position of commercial banks has also deteriorated and credit growth remains sluggish (Table VI. 1). The rise in interest rates and peso depreciation in late 2000 will likely result in further pressures on asset quality, capital positions and liquidity. The authorities project that the ratio of commercial bank NPLs to total loans will increase to about 20 percent by mid-2001. Staff analysis suggests that this would result in a decline in commercial banks’ capital adequacy ratio by about one percentage point. While most large commercial banks appear healthy and able to withstand additional shocks, a handful of banks remain fragile. Despite their high average levels of capitalization, two expanded commercial banks reported capital levels below the absolute minimum levels, as of end-September 2000. Three commercial banks reported CARS that were below the required minimum of 10 percent2 (Table VI.2). There were also several small commercial banks with capital levels below the requirement. In addition, several episodes of sizable bank deposit withdrawals in 2000 suggest some fragility of depositor confidence. The first one involved Urban Bank in April 2000 (see below), followed by sizable withdrawals from PNB in early October 2000 triggered by uncertainty about plans for rehabilitating the ’ At present, CAR are not based on the Base1 risk-based capital standards (and thus exclude capital coverage for market risks and off-balance sheet activities), and are not applied on a consolidated basis. The prudential data-while much improved in recent years-are also believed to suffer from some continued weakness in loan classification. However, the staff believes that they provide a broadly accurate overall picture of the financial condition of banks. 2 These include PNB and another expanded commercial bank (where a rehabilitation plan has been submitted to the BSP). The CAR reported in both cases was between 8 and 10 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 70 - ANNEX VI bank. The third episode was related to the political crisis and involved withdrawals from several banks perceived to be closely connected to President Estrada (deposits in the affected banks have since stabilized). A number of smaller, weaker banks, are particularly exposed to the risk of failure in the face of a deteriorating economic environment. As of end-September 2000,45 thrift banks and 153 rural banks reported capital levels below the required minimum, and 12 thrift banks and 145 rural banks reported CARS that were below 10 percent.

While efforts towards the consolidation of the system are welcome, the risks involved need to be managed carefully. The increase in the absolute minimum capital levels over the past three years has contributed to the consolidation of the system through mergers and closures. Consolidation is expected to continue, in part under the pressure of an ongoing shift of deposits from small and weak banks to larger banks. While this consolidation is welcome, there is a risk that downgraded banks may continue to engage in high-risk activities but with lower levels of capital. While a provision in the General Banking Law of 2000 prohibits such activities, close supervision of banks are needed to prevent them. Furthermore, there is a concern that weak banks of little systemic importance are being allowed to merge with other weak banks, increasing the potential cost of future rehabilitation. Status of Reforms The authorities have made good progress on banking legislation, but some reforms remain outstanding, particularly with regard to the legal framework for bank resolution. The new General Banking Law (GBL) was enacted in 2000, but final passage of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-71- ANNEX VI amendments to the BSP Act (well advanced in Congress) and a new charter of the Philippines Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) remain outstanding (Box VI. 1). The BSP’s recent experience in dealing with problem banks highlights two key weaknesses in the legal framework for bank resolution. First, the amendments to the BSP Act do not incorporate sufficiently strong legal provisions to protect supervisors in the conduct of their duties and to allow them to access key depositor information. Second, the authorities currently lack an effective range of instruments to intervene in a bank that has failed, but cannot be closed for systemic reasons. Available tools to deal with a failed bank include receivership, liquidation, and rehabilitation with the owners’ consent. However, as has become clear from the experience with PNB (and also from recent banking crises in other countries), BSP and PDIC need other instruments to intervene in a failed bank, such as the write-down of existing shareholder stakes, assisted or forced mergers or acquisitions, and forced restructuring. Without these instruments, the BSP’s ability to deal with troubled banks (especially the large ones) and a systemic crisis remains potentially limited. The supervisory framework continues to be strengthened and plans are in place to implement consolidated supervision by end-January 2001. The BSP has recently implemented a number of improvements in its on- and off-site monitoring and prompt corrective action. The recently introduced Bank Performance Reports and Early Warning System, which form the basis for sensitivity analysis on individual banks, are increasingly utilized by the supervisory departments. The BSP is moving towards the introduction of risk- focused bank examinations. While the introduction of electronic reporting has improved data collection, some weaknesses remain in the reporting by non-bank financial institutions. The prompt intervention in Urban Bank in April 2000 reflected a significant improvement in corrective action taken by the BSP, although the case also highlighted the vulnerability of banks to problems in their non-banking affiliates and the need to expedite consolidated supervision. In April 2000, Urban Bank3 experienced a run triggered by losses in its investment affiliate and the bank’s inability to meet the new higher capital requirements. While the bank was closed promptly by the BSP and placed under receivership by the PDIC, other banks were affected by the run, and the BSP extended liquidity support equivalent to ‘/2 percent of GNP. The case highlighted weaknesses in the supervision of non- banking affiliates of banks, and motivated efforts to reorganize the Supervision and Examination Sector (SES), including reallocation and any necessary increase of staff, to allow all entities in the same group to be examined by the same section. The BSP has also initiated efforts to coordinate its supervisory activities with other financial regulators, and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the BSP and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been drafted. 3 A smaller commercial bank, with assets representing 0.4 percent of total assets in the banking system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 72 - ANNEX VI The PDIC insurance fund may need to be increased in order to ensure sufficient capacity to handle possible contingencies. Assistance to troubled banks is usually undertaken jointly by the BSP and the PDIC. When the cost of assistance required is higher than PDlC’s cost of closure (least cost resolution), BSP assists PDIC to cover the remaining cost. The current size of the PDIC fund is P 27 billion, which amounts to 6 percent of insured deposits and approximately 1.4 percent of banking sectors deposits. Policy Priorities The recent problems faced by the BSP in resolving troubled banks indicate the need to strengthen the legal framework for bank resolution. Slow credit growth coupled with an increasing level of NPLs will continue to challenge banks (especially small and medium- sized ones) and the BSP must be empowered and equipped to adequately respond. Strengthening the framework for bank resolution would require, in particular: l Passage of amendments to the BSP Act and of the PDIC charter. l Legislative change to introduce an effective range of instruments for the BSP/PDIC to intervene in a systemic bank, such as the write-down of existing shareholder stakes, assisted or forced mergers or acquisitions, and forced restructuring. Continued efforts are needed to move toward international best practices in the supervision of the fmancial sector (iucludiug the non-bank fmancial sector). Pending legislative changes should be expedited, and international regulatory standards fully implemented, suggesting action particularly in the following areas: Issuance of implementing regulations to the GBL, which are in keeping with international standards, and expediting the implementation of the Base1 risk-based capital adequacy requirements and consolidated supervision. The authorities expect these rules to be in place by early 2001, at the latest. Strict enforcement of laws and regulations, with limited forbearance and consistent application of sanctions for non-compliance. The merger of weak banks should be disallowed, and fit-and-proper rules for new shareholders, directors and senior officers should be applied rigorously when banks are being merged or consolidated. Public financial assistance to banks should be minimized, especially at concessionary terms, and all public support to the banking system should be transparent and eventually captured in the budget. PDIC should have adequate resources to fully and effectively handle bank resolution. Bank secrecy rules should be relaxed to allow bank supervision within the “perimeter” of secrecy, and protection of supervision against litigation should be upgraded.

The General Banking Law, BSP Act, and PDIC Charter The General Banking Law of 2000 (GBL) that was adopted in May 2000 amended the General Banking Act and enhanced the BSP’s supervisory powers, tightened prudential noms and liberal&d foreign ownership of banks. The BSP now has the power to conduct more in-depth examinations of banks and undertake more effective prompt corrective action. The GBL, however, repeals the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (PDIC) independent right to conduct on-site supervision and require information from banks. The GBL reforms introduced include: a strong legal basis for consolidated supervision; formal adoption of Base1 risk-based capital requirements; fit-and-proper criteria for directors and officers; stronger safeguards against connected lending and more comprehensive coverage of single borrower’s limit; inclusion of the declaration of a bank holiday as a ground for placing a bank under receivership; the legal basis for formulating standards determining unsafe and unsound bank practices; ownership ceilings by foreign and domestic banks; increases in monetary penalties; and improved transparency and disclosure standards. A Task Force has been created to draft the implementing regulations for the GBL. Regulations on the adoption of Base1 risk-based capital standards, fit-and-proper criteria, ownership ceilings, and the BSP’s regulatory authority are expected to be issued by early 2001 at the latest. Proposed amendments to the BSP Act (well advanced in Congress) will further enhance the BSP’s supervisory powers. They include: w restoring BSP’s tax exemption status on open market operations; 0 strengthening the regulation of derivative activities by banks, by extending BSP supervisory powers to entities engaged in trust operations and/or fund management activities; l increasing penalties and sanctions against banks for noncompliance; l strengthening the criteria for placing a bank under receivership or liquidation;” and l allowing BSP examiners access to deposit accounts of at least P 50 million (about $1 million) believed to be used in relation to fraud or irregularity. Amendments to the PDIC charter have also being proposed but are unlikely to be enacted by the end of the current session in Congress. The proposed amendments include: w restoring its power to conduct on-site supervision and require information from banks;’ w enhancing legal protection for supervisors in the conduct of their duties; . increasing maximum deposit insurance coverage; and w . recapitalizing the deposit insurance fund. 1/ Additional criteria include a capital to asset ratio of less than 2 percent continuously for more than 90 days 2/ The GBL repealed the PDIC’s independent power in these areas.

The main weaknesses lie in the national accounts and balance of payments statistics, where official statistics have left largely unrecorded the rapid growth of the electronics sector in the 1990s. To a much lesser extent, financial liberalization has also affected monetary and banking statistics. This annex lays out the key problems and points to actions needed to improve the quality of statistics. The Philippines has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). In July 2000, the Philippines submitted the prescribed Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity (Reserves Template) to the IMF. The authorities were releasing data on nondeliverable forward contracts (NDFs, shown in a footnote) with a four-month lag rather than the one-month lag standard, but have since committed to release data with a one-month lag from December 29,200O. A. National Accounts Key weaknesses There are serious problems with the quality of the national accounts that likely result in the measured level and growth of GDP being substantially underestimated. The problems are shown by large discrepancies between the current-price GDP measured from the expenditure side and GDP from the production side (the official GDP measure), with the statistical discrepancy steadily increasing from 2% percent to 7 percent of quarterly GDP over the past two years. During the same period, the alternative expenditure-based current price GDP measure grew on average 3% percent (y/y) faster than the offtcial quarterly GDP growth rate, suggesting an understatement of GDP volume growth by about the same order of magnitude. These differences are likely due to the underestimation of the rapid growth in the electronics industry on the production side of the national accounts. These problems arise because deaths and births of estabiishments are not adequately measured, a gap of growing importance given the rapid structural change in the economy in recent years. Annual surveys are designed to pick up deaths and births but the latest data are from the 1995 National Statistical Office (NSO) annual survey of establishments. The 1996 and 1997 annual surveys have been substantially delayed due to funding problems. This implies that a large number of new establishments in the electronics and information technology industry are not covered in the national accounts. The problems are further compounded by over-reliance on fixed value added-to- output and informal-to-formal sector ratios derived from the latest available annual survey (currently 1995). Value added at current prices in the electronics industry is estimated as a fixed share of output in spite of industry evidence that the domestic component of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 76 - ANNEX VII exports has been rising sharply.’ Similarly, the contribution from the informal sector is estimated using a fixed ratio in spite of evidence that the informal-to-formal sector ratio may have increased during the years and decreased, subsequently affected by the Asian crisis. Constant price data suffer from further problems, resulting in a substantial underestimation of exports and imports volume growth. The national accounts constant price estimates for merchandise exports and imports are constructed as 1985 unit values (per kilo) multiplied with quantity data (in kilos) from the foreign trade statistics. As a result of this inappropriate method, implicit deflators for electric machinery products are running suspiciously high compared with developments in world market prices (e.g., the implicit deflator for exports of semiconductors and microcircuits increased by more than 900 percent in peso terms since 1985 while world market prices in peso terms have increased by less than 20 percent). Finally, the base year (1985) for the constant price estimates is outdated. Measures in progress l The 1996 and 1997 annual surveys of establishments have just been completed and are pending publication. l An economic census is currently being undertaken (collecting data for 1999). l The authorities have commenced a 5-year program for revising their national accounts compilation system, which encompasses implementation of the latest international national accounts standard (the System of National Accounts 1993), improvements in the constant price estimation techniques (including chain-linked volume measures) and an update of the fixed ratios used in the compilation procedures. Recommendations for further action Short-term l Revise the national accounts current price estimates to incorporate the results of the 1996 and 1997 annual surveys using the benchmarking technique and software provided by the IMF during seminars attended by Philippine compilers. To avoid introducing breaks in the time series, data back to at least 1994 should be revised. l Revise the national accounts constant price estimates for exports and imports for 1985-2000 using National Statistics Office price data combined with proxy world market price indices from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for electronics.2 ’ Official figures for the electronic sector suggest that value added stayed at 10 percent of exports over the past years while industry representatives indicate that the domestic component has increased significantly, to around 30 percent in recent years. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 77 - ANNEX VII l Adopt a more flexible and transparent revision policy to facilitate timely publication of revisions. The current revision policy only allows for the latest few years to be revised during the annual May revision round. l Secure funding for the NSO annual survey of establishments and needed improvements in the NSO quarterly and monthly surveys of establishments, to ensure updated coverage of births and deaths of establishments. Medium-term l Revise the estimation and sampling procedures for the quarterly and monthly establishment surveys to pick up deaths and births of establishments. l So as to reduce the dependence on fmed ratios, consider using “supply and use” tables as a coordinating compilation framework. B. Balance of Payments Key weaknesses Large and widening reporting gaps in the balance of payments, as well as misclassifications, have resulted in an overestimation of the current account surplus and the emergence of very sizable errors and omissions (estimated at about 4% percent of GNP in 2000).3 Staff estimates suggest that the current account surplus is more likely to have been about 3-5 percent of GNP in 2000 rather that the official 10% percent of GNP (based on official data). The overestimation of the current account surplus appears to be due to an underestimation of both profit and dividend outflows (subsequently largely reinvested) and imports of goods and services, especially in the electronics sector. In addition, there are important inconsistencies between the Money and Banking, External Debt, BOP, and national accounts statistics that hamper economic analysis and should be eliminated.4 The problems arise because international transactions are increasingly flowing through nontraditional channels that are not covered by the statistical reporting system. The 2 The US export, import, and producer price indices use hedonic, and other, state of the art techniques to take account of quality changes. For that reason, other countries, including some of the most statistically advanced, are using U.S. price indices for these products. 3 A technical assistance mission in October 2000 also focused on addressing the weaknesses in the balance of payments. 4 For example, the national accounts includes higher workers’ remittances than the BOP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-78 - ANNEX VII reporting requirements of the banking system’ relate only to that portion of foreign exchange transactions settled through the Regular Banking Units of domestic banks, which represents about 25 percent of foreign exchange settlements. The gaps include transactions conducted via: l Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs) of domestic banks; l Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) of domestic banks; l Foreign Exchange Corporations; l Nonresident peso accounts with domestic banks; a Thrift banks; l Nonbank accounts with banks abroad; and l Intercompany accounts, including transactions that do not involve cash settlements or exchange of financial assets, particularly for the electronics and information technology industries. The main data gap relates to transactions conducted via Foreign Currency Deposits Units (FCDUs) of domestic banks, which is a long-standing problems. Because of the strict secrecy rules attached to these accounts, the banks do not obtain from their clients adequate information for statistical reporting. This results in misclassifications and double counting in the balance of payments statistics. If the secrecy rules associated with FCDU accounts are not modified to permit the collection of data for statistical purposes, the quality of the balance of payments will remain poor. These problems have been compounded by a lack of resources devoted to compilation of BOP statistics. The time that compilers (at the BSP) can devote to develop improved sources and methods have been squeezed by non-compilation related tasks. As a consequence, there has been slow progress in implementing improvements recommended by the various IMF BOP statistics technical assistance missions to the Philippines since 1995. Measures in progress l BSP intends to conduct a cross-border survey for transactions settled through accounts abroad and intercompany accounts; with data incorporated in the BOP from early 2001; this depends on approval of the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB). l Expanded reporting requirements to incorporate foreign positions and transactions through OBUs, Foreign Exchange corporations, and thrift banks in the BOP accounts (and OBUs’ foreign liabilities in debt, money and banking statistics) are scheduled to be implemented by the BSP in January 2001. 5 Based on the report forms employed during the period of exchange controls, making it difficult to verify data while imposing an unnecessarily large reporting burden on banks.

Recommendations for further action Speedily implement the scheduled cross-border survey. Evaluate available supplementary data sources, such as annual profit and loss statements and balance sheets reported to the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the 5000 largest companies, and incorporate them into the BOP. Improve the bank reporting system to include transactions settled through peso- denominated foreign accounts with domestic banks. Introduce a foreign direct investment survey to provide estimates on reinvested earnings and data for compilation of the planned International Investment Position. A voluntary reporting on transactions via FCDU accounts should be introduced for the largest enterprises if the secrecy rules are not modified. Revise BOP data for past years by carrying back improvements and adjustments stemming from the new sources and methods being developed, to avoid introducing breaks in the series that could seriously hamper economic analysis. Adopt a flexible and transparent revision policy to facilitate timely incorporation of improvements in sources and methods. Secure sufficient resources for BOP compilation, and consider establishing a separate group within the BSP that has BOP compilation as its sole responsibility. Consider outsourcing to NSO data collection tasks, that are not author&d by the current BSP Act. C. Monetary Accounts While the framework underlying the compilation of the monetary statistics largely conforms to the Fund’s methodology, major structural changes in the financial system following liberalization have affected data for the central bank, commercial banks, and nonbank financial intermediaries. A Money and Banking Statistics mission visited Manila in mid-l 999 to review the issues, and make recommendations. In November 2000, a follow- up mission took place to review the implementation of the earlier recommendations, and update the compilation methodology in view of recent developments in the financial system. The missions identified improvements that should be implemented with regard to coverage and quality of the monetary aggregates. In terms of coverage, the growth in activities of rural and thrift banks, offshore banking units, as well as non-bank financial intermediaries have so far not been captured in the monetary aggregates. Efforts are underway to compile a depository corporations survey (banking survey) that would cover all institutions that accept deposits or issue instruments that are considered as their substitutes. Consideration should also be given to compiling a more broadly defined financial survey that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8O- ANNEX VII . will include other financial corporations-those that are currently classified as nonbanks in the Philippines financial sector. To improve the quality of the statistics the treatment of non- operational banks, valuation of foreign exchangedenominated accounts of the BSP, and accrued interest in monetary statistics aggregates need to be brought into line with international norms.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Philippines On February 9, 2001, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Philippines.’ Background Since the last Article IV Consultation in mid-1999, economic performance has been mixed. On the positive side, growth firmed through the third quarter of 2000 and likely reached more than 4 percent for the year as a whole; inflation was low (albeit rising); and strong export growth sustained a sizable current account surplus. Progress was also made on some key structural reforms. However, the positive results were undermined by failure to meet budget targets, governance problems, and concerns about security. In October 2000, a political crisis arising from allegations of corruption against President Estrada triggered turmoil in financial markets, further damaging investor confidence and causing intensified pressure on the peso and higher interest rates. Although the markets have sinced calmed somewhat, the outlook for 2001 is clouded by weak investor sentiment, political uncertainty, and a less favorable external environment. While growth was firming prior to the recent turmoil in financial markets, it is now expected to slow. Real GDP grew by 49% percent (y/y) in the third quarter of 2000 (led by agriculture and exports), Activity is expected to be dampened in the first half of 2001 by the higher interest rates, weaker investor confidence, and slowing world demand for electronics. IMF staff currently projects a central scenario with GDP growth of about 2% percent for 2001; however, the outlook ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the 02,09,2001 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

Inflation fell to 3-4 percent (y/y) in the first half of 2000 (partly because of the impact of a good harvest on food prices), but it has since risen to 8.6 percent (y/y) in December, due to higher world oil prices, peso depreciation, and rising food prices. It is projected to rise further to about S-8% percent by Q2-2001 (reflecting the lagged impact of peso depreciation and higher minimum wages), and then to decline to 6-7 percent by end-2001. The targeted reduction in the fiscal deficit was not accomplished in 2000. The National Government (NG) budget deficit reached 4.5 percent of GNP (against the target of 2.9 percent), mainly because of a shortfall in revenue. While part of the continued revenue slippage was due to the concentration of growth in the lightly taxed agriculture and electronics sectors, failure to implement planned tax measures and poor governance in the Bureau of Internal Revenue (despite some progress on tax administration reform in 2000) are also responsible. Spending exceeded the target by 0.4 percent of GNP because of higher interest payments and non- interest spending overruns. The external current account continues to be in surplus and the outlook remains favorable, but capital outflows have increased. Strong demand for electronics boosted export growth early in the year,.although growth has moderated in recent months. Wiih imports remaining sluggish, the measured current account surplus reached over 10 percent of GNP in 2000. The surplus, however, is likely overstated-possibly by several percentage points of GNP-due to statistical problems (for example, profit/dividends outflows of the electronics sector are likely understated). While medium-term loans and direct investment flows were positive in 2000, portfolio and other capital oufflows increased sharply. Looking ahead, export growth is expected to slow somewhat, given the softening of world demand for electronics, but imports are projected to remain sluggish until investment recovers. As a result, the current account is expected to remain in surplus in 2001. The banking system appears fairly stable, due to past reforms. The ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans crept up to 15% percent in late 2000 (partly reflecting tighter loan classification rules), and the recent rise in interest rates and peso depreciation may put some further moderate pressure on NPLs. However, commercial banks’ average capital adequacy ratio remains above the statutory norm (IO percent), reflecting the reported strong capital position of most large banks. Structural reforms regained momentum in early 2000, but progress has now slowed again. A General Banking Act, Securities Act, and a law liberalizing foreign investment in retail trade were enacted, but power sector reform and a revised BSP Act-after making good progress through Congress-were stalled by the political crisis. Rehabilitation the Philippine National Bank has proved difficult, and while some progress has been made on tax administration reforms, revenue performance has continued to disappoint.
