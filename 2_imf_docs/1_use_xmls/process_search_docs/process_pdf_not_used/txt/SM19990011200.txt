The macroeconomic situation improved in 1998, as growth rose to 6.3 percent, boosted by the recovery of agricultural production, favorable terms of trade effects, strong export receipts (notably tourism), and a resurgence of private investment. Inflation stabilized at under 3 percent, the external current account deficit remained below 1 percent of GDP and reserves were raised to a comfortable level (USrS4 billion). Continued prudence in monetary management and a budget deficit held unchanged at around 3.5 percent of GDP contributed to preserving macroeconomic stability. Limited openness of the capital account has insulated domestic financial markets from turbulence abroad. Prospects for 1999 are for a slowdown of growth to around 3 percent (on account of a shortfall in agricultural production) with inflaiion and the external current account remaining roughly unchanged. The primary objective of the left-center government that came into power in February 1998 is to double growth to a steady 6 percent per annum by 2002/03, based on a three-pronged strategy of budgetary retrenchment (to make room for private investment), budgetary restructuring (to increase investment in social and physical infrastructure), and structural reforms (to raise productivity and incentives to invest). Policy issues The authorities’ fiscal objective is to reduce the budget deficit to under 2 percent by 2001/02, while increasing social and investment spending. To that end, the staff recommended aiming for a deficit of around 3 percent of GDP in FY 1999/2000 (starting on July l), based on a containment of the wage bill, the phasing out of inefficient food subsidies, and tax reform. Against strong pressures for a more expansionary fiscal stance, the authorities adopted a draft budget for FY 1999/2000 aiming for a deficit of 3.8 percent of GDP. The draft budget preserves macroeconomic stability, but does not make much headway toward fiscal consolidation and budget restructuring. By its breadth, the structural reform agenda touches on all the main impediments to growth, and sensitive issues (e.g., food subsidies, labor code) have been brought into the public debate. However, the expected surge in productivity underpinning the growth scenario requires a quickening of the pace of reform, notably in the areas of privatization, and liberalization of prices and markets (including the labor market). In view of the recent losses in external competitiveness and heightened competitive pressures which will be exacerbated by custom tariff reductions with the European Union, the authorities’ growth strategy would require a more flexible exchange regime, backed by the ongoing strengthening of the domestic monetary framework. This should be underpinned by renewed efforts at budget restructuring and greater fiscal consolidation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- 1. INTRODUCTION 1. Discussions for the 1999 Article IV consultation with Morocco were held in Rabat and Casablanca in two stages: the first (November 8-19, 1998) covered major structural issues and the second (February 22-March 5,1999) focused on the macroeconomic framework and policies. Discussion on the 1999/2000 budget were concluded in Washington during April 28-29,1999. The staff team’ met with the Ministers of Economy and Finance, of Industry, Commerce, and Handicrafts, of Social Development, Solidarity, and Professional Training, of Civil Service and Administrative Reform, of Education, of Justice, and with the Minister in charge of the General Affairs of the Government, the Governor of Bank Al-Maghrib, and the Economic Counselor to the Ring. Mr. Dalri, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco, participated in all the meetings. The staff also met with high public officials Tom various ministries, and with representatives of the business and banking communities. At the conclusion of the last Article lV consultation, on March 18, 1998, Directors welcomed the progress made in liberalizing the economy while maintaining stable macroeconomic conditions. They noted, however, that growth was still insufficient to reverse the rise in unemployment and to improve social conditions. Directors recommended accelerating the pace of structural reforms while further strengthening macroeconomic policies. They emphasized that fiscal consolidation should be given high priority and encouraged the authorities to reduce the government wage bill, reform the food subsidy system, and increase tax revenues. II. BACKGROUND 2. Following elections in November 1997, a new coalition government came into power in February 1998, under the premiership of Mr. Youssoufl, a long-time socialist opposition figure. The transfer of power to a center-left government is the direct result of a process of political liberalization that Ring Hassan II put into motion with the amended constitution of 1996, providing for direct elections of the lower house of Parliament and greater accountar bility of the govermnent to Parliament. Some degree of continuity was preserved with the appointment of key political figures from the previous government in the new cabinet, including at the Ministries of the Interior, Justice, and Foreign Affairs. The planned UN-sponsored referendum on the status of the southern Sahara provinces has been deferred to 2000, and the border with Algeria continues to be closed. 3. The challenges facing the new government are formidable: high urban unemploy- ment-increasingly among graduates-widespread rural poverty, and relatively low growth, reflecting not only the drought conditions of 1997 but also successive years of weak private investment. Indeed, growth in the nonagricultural sector has gradually declined (Chart 1) to a ‘The team included Mr. Nashashibi (head), Mr. Gardner, Ms. Fichera, Ms. Sampic, and Ms. Vimond (Staff Assistant)-all MED.

Meanwhiie, social indicators remain weak. Despite some recent improvement, the literacy rate is only around 50 percent (and lags behind in rural areas, particularly among females, where it barely reaches 20 percent and where most of the effort is taking place). About 2% to 3 million children are out of school, and the authorities have put in place a variety of schemes to integrate them into the school population. Against this background, employment and social issues were a central theme in the elections, and raised expectations as well as pressures on the new government to upgrade social spending. A. Economic Developments in 1998 4. Macroeconomic conditions improved during the government’s first year in offrce. The recovery of agricultural production, favorable terms of trade effects (with the prices of phosphate exports rising on world markets in contrast to the decline in the prices of imported wheat and oil products), and buoyant export receipts (notably from tourism) boosted GDP growth to 6.3 percent in 1998 (Chart 2). Domestic demand was also strengthened by an encouraging resurgence of private fixed capital formation, which had been held back by political and economic uncertainties. The adoption of a relatively sound budget in July 1998 (below) helped dissipate such uncertainties. 5. The gains achieved in terms of disinflation during the 1990s were preserved in 1998. Although inflation rose from 1.0 percent in 1997 to 2.7 percent in 1998, this accelera- tion reflected essentially the behavior of food prices; excluding foodstuff, inflation actually declined? Even so, the &X-based) real effective exchange rate appreciated by 2.4 percent in 1998 on account of the small positive inflation differential vis-a-vis the currencies of the exchange rate peg, and the nominal appreciation vis-a-vis some emerging market competitors (Chart 3). Since 1990, the real effective exchange rate has appreciated by 17 percent. 6. The external accounts of Morocco have remained remarkably stable. Favorable terms of trade developments and strong export receipts helped offset the surge in imports linked to the pick-up of investment. The current account deficit was contained at 0.7 percent of GDP, making it possible to increase foreign exchange reserves to US$4.4 billion (and stabilizing them at around 4.5 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services), despite a marked decline in FDI inflows. In the absence of new large privatization operations in 1998, FDI inflows fell to US$O.4 billion compared with US$ 1.1 billion in 1997. Portfolio flows remained marginal. Indeed, the limited integration of domestic financial markets with world markets has been one of the factors insulating Morocco from financial turbulence abroad. 2Higher food price inflation in 1998 reflects, with a lag, the crop failures of 1997.

The transitional budget for FY 1998/99 aimed at holding the deficit unchanged at around 3.5 percent of GDP (Chart 4). Coming into place just a few months after the formation of the new government, the FY 1998199 budget (starting on July 1, 1998) could not articulate in full the government’s policy orientations. Faced with rising expenditure pressures (from pre-existing wage commitments and from a desire to upgrade social spending) and the prospects of declining tax revenues (due to the expected reduction in import tariffs under the Association Agreement with the European Union (EU)), the deficit target was achieved mainly through one-off revenue measures, including a tax amnesty (expected to yield 0.7 percent of GDP) and exceptional dividend payments obtained from state enterprises (0.4 percent of GDP). 8. Monetary policy has remained prudent. Limited capital mobility has enabled the central bank (Bank Al-Maghrib) to pursue independent domestic monetary objectives while maintaining a fixed exchange rate regime. The central bank has set a yearly quantitative target for broad money growth, even though the authorities have relied principally on the exchange rate peg as a nominal anchor. Domestic portfolio shifts linked to the development of mutual funds and money market funds contributed to slow down the growth of broad money through 1998 to 6.5 percent, compared to the 8 percent target set by the central bank (Chart 5). Meanwhile, the intervention interest rates of Bank Al-Maghrib were reduced by 50 basis points in February 1998. This reduction was fidly reflected in deposit and lending rates, albeit with a lag, and to a lesser extent in one-year treasury bill rate in the primary market, which had anticipated the decline. The central bank’s intervention rates were lowered by an additional 50 basis points in March 1999. Based on a one-year treasury bill rate ofjust under 7 percent, the real interest rate is presently of the order of 4 percent. Credit to the nongovernment sector (10.8 percent growth through 1998) was the main counterpart to monetary growth, reflecting the pickup of investment activity in the second half of the year. The growth in net credit to the general government was close to nil, on account of the successful placement of bonds to the nonbank public and the elimination of the liquidity requirement in treasury paper @luncher d ‘@fits publics) in July 1998, which had made banks a captive market for treasury paper. 9. Structural reforms proceeded on several fronts in 1998, and into 1999, albeit at a decelerating pace (Box 1). The most notable successes were registered in customs adminis- tration (Box 2) and judicial reform, with the establishment of six commercial courts which helped absorb the backlog of cases and also established a more effective legal framework for resolving business conflicts. On other fronts, the pace of reform slowed down: the volume and the number of privatization operations declined markedly; the competition law providing for price liberalization was adopted, but with a five year derogation for liberalizing the prices of some thirty commodities; the liberalization of merchandise road transport was diluted by a two year moratorium on its applicability; and the search for a consensual agreement on a more flexible labor code over the last two years has not yet reached a conclusion.

Morocco: Customs Reforms Since 1996, the Moroccan authorities have undertaken a comprehensive modernisation of customs organization and procedures, aimed at streamlining import procedures, accelerating the cargo clearance process, and improving the effectiveness of customs controls. This was seen as essential to ensurc the success of trade liberalization. The program of reform was implemented with the assistance of the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF. Progress made has been impressive and the most significant achievements include the following: * Organization. The administration was rcorganized along functional lines. Staff supervision and : reporting systems were reinforced. Sizable resources were allocated for the development and the 1 management of new computer systems, for the training of staff, and for public campaigns designed to I inform the business community of the new procedures. According to the employers federations and customs brokers, efficiency and transparency in customs procedures have improved significantly. I l Legislation. A new valuation system was introduced in observance of the new WTO valuation rules. The customs legal code was revised and should soon bc submitted to Parliament. Regulations relating to the duty free import of raw materials and semi-finished goods for processing and re- export, were streamlined to promote activities of small and medium enterprises. l Clearance and control procedures. Data from customs declarations arc now processed by computers and selective controls have replaced systematic controls. The average processing time for customs declarations has been reduced from six days to less than one day. More than 70 percent of consignments are now released upon filing the customs declaration and an 85 percent share is targeted for 1999. However, there has been some decline in custom revenue. l Computerization. A new computcrization master plan was adopted in December 1997 and is now being implemented. Major achievements include computer processing of manifests clcarcd upon acceptance of import declarations and automated selection of transactions to require documentary review and/or physical inspection. A work plan has been adopted to address the Year 2000 problem tn customs computer programs. Remaining tasks include: . a further simplification of procedures to help promote exports from the inland parts of the country; l the implementation by customs of the taxpayer’s identilication number developed by the Tax Directorate to allow exchange of information on importers and exporters; l the development of computer systems with an integrated tariff and a database on import values, to assist in control functions; . the extension of the present computer system to inland oflices; and l the standardization of computer equipment and systems to allow computer interfaces with importers/brokers.

The first phase of the tariff reduction vis-&vis the EU was deferred because of the delays in the ratification of the Association Agreement by two EU member states. It is now scheduled to come into effect on July 1, 1999. Because of its phasing, trade liberalization with the EU will at first imply an increase in effective protection. In March 1999, Morocco and Tunisia signed a free-trade agreement, providing for the immediate liberalization of some 2,000 products and for the complete phasing out of tariff barriers between the two countries by December 3 1,2007. As of December 3 1, 1998, the weighted average tariff rate was 11.9 percent, as compared with 12.2 percent in 1997 (this excludes the 15 percent import surcharge applicable to most imports); there are six tariff bands with a top rate of 50 percent, and an average (unweighted) rate of just under 25 percent, which implies that Morocco’s trade regime is still quite protective.3 11. Financial sector development progressed markedly during 1998 (Chart 6). The year witnessed an impressive acceleration of secondary market activity in treasury paper, linked to the issue of auctioned treasury bonds4 (now accounting for 55 percent of domestic debt), and to the development of mutual funds, whose assets more than doubled (to 8 percent of GDP) in the course of 1998. The stock market saw another strong year in 1998 with a 20 percent increase in the price index, raising market capitalization to 42 percent of GDP by year end. Since then, the stock market index has declined by 3.75 percent (as of end-April). 12. The performance of the Moroccan banking sector, as reflected by asset quality, capital adequacy, earnings and strength of management capabilities, is satisfactory. In particular, the weighted capital adequacy ratio rose to 12.6 percent in December 1998 for the banking system as a whole, with only one small bank out of 19 still failing to meet the 8 percent capital requirement.. The main concerns pertain to the lack of competition as well as the growing level of nonperforming loans, which increased to 12.6 percent of total credits by the end of 1998, from 10.9 percent at the end of 1997, reflecting mostly the reclassification of existing problem loans of public sector banks. As a result, the ratio of provisions to problem loans declines from 73.2 percent to 61.2 percent over the same period. Morocco meets most of the Basle Committee core principles on banking supervision. However, commercial banks participate in decisions on bank licensing and liquidation, which can lead to a conflict of interest. A number of actions have been taken to strengthen the balance sheet of state banks. In 1998 the agricultural bank (CNCA) was recapitalized and delinquent loans to small farmers were rescheduled (and the interest rate charges were reduced with budgetary l ‘Based on 1995 data, Morocco had a ranking of eight (on a scale of ten) in the trade restrictiveness index. With the reduction in some tariffs and the elimination of most non- tariff barriers, it has moved to a ranking of seven. Agricultural products, which were subject to quantitative restrictions until 1996, are taxed at variable rates. 4The deepening of the secondary market has been facilitated by the reopening of existing bond lines at successive weekly auctions of treasury bonds.

Also, the management of hotels that had defaulted on their loans to the state real estate bank (CM) was transferred by the courts to professional managers. In the course of 1999, the status of the state savings bank (Banque Centrule PopuZuire) and of the CNCA is to change to that ofjoint-stock companies. At the same time, financial support for the CNCA’s noncommercial activities (risky lending to small farmers) will be provided directly by the budget, although the terms of this arrangement have yet to be finalized. 13. Active management of the external public and publicly guaranteed debt has enabled the authorities to reduce Morocco’s external debt burden, which remains, however, quite high (with a debt service to export ratio of 29 percent in 19%): Measures included: (i) early repayment and renegotiation of the terms of the more onerous debt with official creditors; (ii) the replacement of maturing external debt with domestic debt and lower cost external debt;6 and (iii) debt for equity swaps with France and Spain. In order to further reduce external debt (USS20 billion at the end of 1998), the authorities are seeking the Paris Club’s agreement to raising the ceiling on debt-equity swaps beyond the current 20 percent limit. 14. Demographic dynamics and large migration flows from rural to urban areas have deepened the shortage of housing. The program put in place in 1995 for the construction of 200,000 housing units has been proceeding more slowly than envisaged, in part because of delays in providing the basic infrastructure needed before construction could begin. The recent adoption of a Jaw providing for the securitization of mortgage lending should help develop this market, as should the draft law providing for more flexible rental arrangements. C. Prospects for 1999 15. GDP is projected to grow at 3.0 percent in 1999, with inflation stabilixing at around 2.5 percent. This deceleration in growth reflects mainly the effects of an average agricultural season due to late rainfall. Growth of nonagricultural output (82 percent of GDP) should be sustained by continued strength of domestic demand. Despite the weakening outlook in Morocco’s main export markets, the external current account deficit is expected to remain roughly unchanged at 0.7 percent of GDP on account of strong tourism receipts and a further improvement in the terms of trade. 16. The fiscal deficit for the current fiscal year (ending June 30, 1999) should be somewhat lower than envisaged in the budget law (3.4 percent instead of 3.6 percent of GDP, excluding privatization revenues). Two factors are chiefly responsible for this ‘Ratio to exports of goods, nonfactor services, and transfers. %cluding the refinancing of onerous debt by lower interest loans partially guaranteed by the French Development Agency in the context of bilateral assistance.

The postponement of the reduction of trade tariffs did not generate a revenue windfall in FY 1998/99 because of the offsetting change in the structure of imports (toward capital goods) which lowered the overall yield of the tariff system. Excluding one-off measures (on both the revenue and expenditure sides), the under- lying deficit for 1998199 is put at 4.6 percent of GDP, compared with around 3.5 percent in the preceding two years, implying a significant deterioration in the structural deticit. III. POLKY DISCUSSIONS 17. The primary economic objective of the new government is to double trend GDP growth to 6 percent per annum by 2002/03. The government’s intention is to reach the growth objective through a three-pronged strategy based on deficit reduction (to make room for private investment), budget restructuring (to free budgetary resources for increased social and physical infrastructure), and structural reforms (to raise productivity and incentives to invest). The main themes of the strategy are articulated in a draft medium-term plan (Note d’orientution duplun), which is to be tinalized and published later in 1999.’ 18. Discussions centered on both the macroeconomic and microeconomic requirements of the authorities’ growth strategy and on the adequacy of the fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and structural policies underpinning it. The staff also stressed the importance of translating the main elements of the medium-term strategy into a timetable of specific actions, with a view to having an integrated strategy ready with the FY 1999/2000 budget law. Because of delays in the elaboration of a detailed medium-term plan, its discussion in Parliament will not take place until after the adoption of the budget law. A. The Medium-Term Framework 19. Growth strategy. The staff presented to the authorities a medium-term scenario integrating the authorities’ growth objective and medium-term fiscal policy commitments ‘The Note d’orientation duplan also served as the basis for a one-tranche Policy Reform Support Loan from the World Bank (US$250 million), to be approved by the Bank’s Board in early June, with cotinancing from the African Development Bank (US$200 million). The Letter of Development Policies negotiated with the Bank includes commitments on a medium-term framework developed in consultation with Fund staff, as well as policy measures in the areas of public enterprise governance and restructuring, judiciary reform, market liberalization, education, and poverty reduction.

It also requires a sustained growth of exports, to around 8 percent per year in volume terms, compared with an average growth of around 4.7 percent over the 1991-98 period. The staff pointed out that this normative scenario, while optimistic, is realizable provided the pace of fiscal and structural reform is sufficiently brisk to induce the improvement in competitiveness and profitability required to stimulate new investment and exports. 20. Medium-term balance of payments. To protect the level of reserves in the face of a large external debt burden-the debt service ratio is projected at 26 percent in 1999-the authorities noted that they would remain vigilant about containing the external current account deficit. Because of the high import content of growing investment expenditures, the effects of trade liberalization on the structure of domestic consumption, and the uncertain behavior of private saving in response to fiscal consolidation, the medium-term scenario shows a gradual rise of the current account deficit to 2.7 percent of GDP by 2004, still coupled with an increase of the national saving rate by 2 percent of GDP. The staff noted that the widening of the current account deficit should not pose a problem to the extent that it is financed by an increase in FDI and other nondebt creating flows. 21. Baseline scenario. The staff contrasted the above normative scenario with one based on a slower pace of structural reforms and only moderate changes in fiscal policy (Table 2b): wage bill growth capped at 3.5 percent; public investment spending held unchanged in terms of GDP; and the loss in external tariff revenues compensated only partially by new tax measures. In this baseline scenario, the fiscal deficit would rise to a peak of 4.3 percent of GDP in 2000/01, and would gradually decline thereafter to 3.2 percent by 2003/04. The government debt ratio would decline to 70 percent of GDP by 2004, as against 60 percent in the higher growth scenario. In the absence of new productivity gains, the private investment rate would stagnate, the volume of export growth would remain at 4.7 percent per year over the medium term, and GDP growth would stabilize at around 3.5 percent. In these circum- stances, employment and social conditions would be unlikely to improve. 22. In the baseline scenario, the current account deficit would widen slightly (to 1% percent of GDP) on account of a decline in private saving rate to the level observed in the earlier 1990s. In the absence of sufficient FDI inflows, the resulting balance of payments gap would need to be closed by higher debt creating inflows and lower reserve accumulation.‘0 ‘This normative scenario corresponds closely to that developed by the World Bank in consultation with the authorities. 9As captured by a drop in the ICOR from around 7 presently, to 4% by 2003-04. 10Extemal debt (ratio to GDP) declines to 35 percent of GDP by 2004 in the baseline scenario (continued...)

In all, the baseline scenario illustrates that the continuation of current policies would lead to inadequate growth coupled with increased external vulnerability. B. Fiscal Policy Objectives 23. Fiscal consolidation, the first pillar of the growth strategy, is guided by a twin objective: reducing the deficit to below 2 percent of GDP (excluding privatization receipts) by FY 2001102; and raising budgetary saving from around 1 percent of GDP presently to 3.5-4.0 percent by FY 2002/03. This dual objective implicitly makes room for a substantial increase in public investment, which has borne the brunt of fiscal adjustment and which has been reduced to 3 percent of GDP.” The easing of interest rates linked to deficit reduction and the complementarity between public and private investment should help crowd in private investment. 24. Budgetary restructuring, the second pillar of the growth strategy, aims at increasing the productivity of government expenditures by reallocating resources to investments in physical and social int?astructure and better targeted social transfers. The authorities concurred with the staff that, in a deficit reduction context and with the pressures of tariff reductions looming ahead, this objective can only be met by addressing the main sources of rigidity in the budget, namely the wage bill (11.4 percent of GDP) and generalized food subsidies (0.9 percent of GDP financed by the budget). The level of military expenditures (4 percent of GDP) reflects the political uncertainties in the southern Sahara provinces and in the region more generally. It is unlikely to be reduced until these tensions are resolved. 25. Reducing the wage bill is the central element of the medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy, as recognized in the authorities’ stated objective of bringing it down to 8.8 percent of GDP in FY 2003/04, from 11.4 percent in FY 1998/99. The authorities acknowledged that the compression of the wage bill must be based on a thorough reform of the civil service, including retrenchment and devolution to the private sector (Box 3). The mission pointed out that, since any reform of this type is both lengthy and costly, it is essential that the process be put into motion with the FY 1999/2000 budget law and supplemented by a schedule of specific measures to be taken in the following years. It also made the point that the costs of voluntary separation schemes, redeployment, and retraining should be viewed as restructuring expenses, eligible for financing in part by international and regional institutions and, to that extent, falling outside of the existing deficit objective. “( . ..continued) compared with 3 1 percent in the higher growth scenario.

Morocco: Wage Bill and Civil Service Reform The share of the civil service wage bill in GDP (11.4 percent in FY 1998/99) is among the highest in the world. Still, there are personnel shortfalls in some sectors such as primary education, offset by overemployment in others such as secondary education. In general, too many employees are assigned to low-skill tasks. These structural inadequacies reflect: a lack of incentives for training and mobility; management methods based on the principle of strict control, which does not encourage efficiency, accountability, or delegation of duties; excessive centralization; salary structures suffering from a lack of transparency; and promotion rules based more on seniority than merit. The government is well aware of the problems this raises and has declared its intention to reform the structure of the civil service with two main objectives: improving the quality of the services provided by the administration and reducing its cost by lowering the wage bill to 8-9 percent of GDP by FY 2003104. Some steps have already been taken in this direction including: the conduct of a diagnostic study by an outside audit team; the adoption of a Citizen Charter (Pat@ de Bonne G&ion); the adoption of a regulatory framework that allows for redeployment of personnel; and a preliminary census of budgetary positions by ministry. Any lasting reform will require more radical measures including retrenchment and redeployment of civil servants, and the establishment of a more motivating wage and promotion structure. As illustrated below, only a thorough civil service reform (Scenario 1) can achieve the wage bill objective set out by the authorities. By contrast, under unchanged policies (Scenario 2), the wage bill would only be reduced to 9.7 percent of GDP by 2003/04, even in a high growth scenario. A simple wage and net recruitment freeze (Scenario 3), besides being unsustainable, would similarly fail to achieve the wage bill objective. w.ga bill in percent O‘ODP 12.0 I 11.5 . 10.5 - 9.5 - 9.0 - 9.5 _ semario 3 9.0 1999199 199912000 2000101 2001102 2002103 2003104 Scenario 1: Temporary wage freeze, reduction of the civil service from 776,000 (1999/2000) to 723,000 (2003/04), reduction of wage drift from 2.5 percent to 1 percent accompanied by real salary increase starting in 200 1102.

Until the reform is initiated, the mission urged the authorities to adopt measures to contain personnel expenditures, beginning with the FY 1999/2000 budget (below). Because of a wage drift of the order of 2.5 percent, a hiring and wage freeze would keep the wage bill constant in real terms (reducing it to 10.9 percent of GDP). The authorities felt that, in view of the mounting pressures for a new round of wage increases (combined with a probable raise of the minimum wage) and some net recruitment in the social sectors, this would already constitute a major achievement. The mission suggested that some additional retrenchment could be achieved through redeployment and elimination of positions of retiring staff (around 6,000 staff are due to retire next year, or 0.8 percent of total personnel). By actually reducing the government payroll for the first time in years, the government would send an important message concerning civil service reform. 27. Generalized food subsidies, it is now broadly recognized in Morocco, are very inefficient at targeting the poor (Box 4). The combination of subsidies and tariffs protecting cereals, sugar, and oilseeds amount in fact to a system of transfers to inefficient producers (1.8 percent of GDP). About half of the cost of this subsidy system is supported by the budget. Meanwhile, consumer prices for subsidized goods often exceed the target level. The staff thus noted that, on the basis of current and prospective world prices, a reduction of the protective tariffs combined with price liberalization would result in relatively minor price changes at the retail level. The decline in international prices and the recent hikes in domestic prices (particularly for loaf sugar) thus afford an excellent opportunity to eliminate most of the subsidies. The challenge is to begin eliminating subsidies and replacing them with direct but temporary transfers to producers to encourage them to plant crops better suited to Morocco’s climate.” Besides generating a substantial budgetary saving, such a move would improve resource allocation in agriculture. Together with an increase in social expenditures, to be achieved with the creation of the Social Development Agency, such liberalization would ensure that expenditures are better targeted toward the poor. 28. The tax system has been undermined by a proliferation of tax exemptions as well as successive tax amnesties and one-off revenue measures, which have reduced its yield over time. A thorough reform of the system is thus needed to contribute to fiscal consolidation and compensate for the prospective loss of tariff revenues, estimated at over 2 percent of GDP over ten years. The authorities indicated their intention to modemize and improve tax administration, following the successful example of the customs administration. With the adoption of a new and more transparent tax code and the introduction of electronic filing of returns, the authorities hope to increase the tax yield within the current system, and to break the past cycle of accumulating tax arrears and tax amnesties. The mission welcomed this initiative but noted that improvements in tax procedures were unlikely, by themselves, to “It is estimated that two out of the six million hectares planted in cereals should be devoted to crops that are more drought resistant.

Morocco: Generalized Food Subsidies The subsidy scheme for flour, sugar, and vegetable oil (I .8 percent of GDP) essentially compensates consumers for the high tariffs (60-l 10 percent) on the imports of those commodities to the benefit of local producers. Thus, at the current low international prices, the elimination of the subsidy (and concurrent protection) would not result in any significant increase in retail prices of those products. It would, however, require the setup of temporary support schemes for the local producers, who would be unable to face international competition at a normal rate of custom protection (I 5 percent). l The subsidy to flour’ could have been eliminated in the context of the 1999/2000 budget. Because this year’s wheat crop is likely to be below average, the elimination of subsidies combined with a partial reduction of the protective levy on imports of soft wheat would not raise the retail price above the price at which flour is actually found. Given the large number of farmers involved in soft wheat production, the government would need to allocate most of the resulting budgetary savings to support the modernization and/or conversion efforts of domestic soft wheat producers. l In the case of sugar, as a first step, the government could liberalize the price and eliminate subsidies on sugar loafs and pieces, which are already sold at higher than the subsidized prices. Even if consumption would, in part, shift toward granulated sugar (on which subsidies would initially be maintained), the government could reduce sugar subsidies by around 50 percent The subsidy on granulated sugar could then be abolished over the next two years. During the transition period, part of the budgetary saving would need to be set aside to finance special programs aimed at modemizing beetroot and sugar cane cultivations in areas suitable for these activities, and to provide financial support to the farmers who would have to convert to other activities. l Price liberalization and elimination of subsidy for vegetable seeds oil seem the least controversial to implement in the current conditions. Most of locally produced oil is refined from imported raw oil or from local raw oil extracted from imported seeds. Local oil seeds account for 5 percent of oil domestic production. At current international prices, the simultaneous suppression of most of the additional protective tariff and of the subsidy would be consistent with an increase in price of around 10 percent. Moreover, such a price increase would imply a decline in the relative price of olive oil and could favor the shift of some consumers toward this product in which Morocco has a comparative advantage, and which has been hurt by the price distortion caused by subsidies on other vegetable oils. As a first step toward the phasing out of food subsidies, the government opted to recover the subsidies on sugar from food and beverages industries that use subsidized sugars as an input to their production. However, such schemes generally involve heavy administrative costs as well as leakages and distortions favoring users of subsidized goods in the informal sector. The flow subsidies are limited to 1 million tons of a high extraction rate flour, which is called/atine nofionole. -.

Because of the loss in nonrecurrent tax receipts and in tariff revenues, staff projections point to a reduction of the tax to GDP ratio from 23.3 percent of GDP in 1998/99 to 21.7 percent in 1999/2000, under unchanged policies. The mission provided some concrete suggestions on compensating measures, based on the recommendations made by FAD technical assistance in 1997. In particular, there is a need to harmonize VAT rates from four to two and to limit (to small farmers) the tax exemptions enjoyed by the agricultural sector.” These measures could be complemented by increases in excises on tobacco and petroleum products. The authorities indicated that indeed some measures were under consideration, notably the elimination of the preferential tax treatment of capital gains and of financial income from listed stocks and from mutual funds. The strong development of the stock market and mutual funds no longer justified such tax advantages. 29. Dividend payments of public enterprises contributed to an unusually large degree to the revenue performance of FY 1998199. Although the financial situation of public enterprises has indeed improved (notably those of the phosphate producer, the railroad, and the national airline), such payments contained, in the view of enterprises, a large exceptional component (of around DH 1.3 billion, or 0.4 percent of GDP) that should not recur. In the staff view, such practices would undermine the financial position of the enterprises, their ability to obtain financing abroad, and their partnership efforts. The mission urged the authorities to adopt a more predictable dividend policy which would serve the interests of both the enterprises and the state, as an investor and shareholder. 30. Devolution of spending authority to local governments will be broadened with the establishment of regional governments (supplementing the already existing communal governments). The objective is to improve the quality of public expenditure by deferring the commitment of expenditures to local governments, which should be in a better position to assess local needs. The mission stressed that the success of decentralization presupposes a clear and explicit division of responsibilities between the central government, on the one hand, and local governments, on the other. The experience with the communal governments has been disappointing in this respect. Resources transferred to them do not appear to have enhanced the overall effectiveness of government spending, but rather seem to have led to the creation of a parallel bureaucracy. In this context, future devolution needs to be accompanied by a net reduction in the cost of government. The staff recommended that, until the spending responsibilities of the regional governments can be firmly established and monitored, their budgets should be financed out of the resources already earmarked for communal govem- ments, without additional contributions from the central govenmrent budget. Devolution would also be more effective, if fiscal policy decisions were to be informed by better “The agricultural sector (including some agrobusiness) is exempt from income taxes and horn VAT. Moreover, it is reimbursed VAT paid on most material inputs.

Domestic payments arrears have continued to be used as a short-term financing instrument, despite the development of an active primary market in treasury bills. Thus, while the stock of payment arrears has been reduced considerably to around DH 4 billion (about one month payment delay) as of February 1999, it is still subject to large monthly fluctuations--central government arrears stood at DH 13 billion at the end of December 1998. These fluctuations reflect mainly the reluctance of the Treasury (T&or) to incur new debt in the absence of very short-term financing instruments. The authorities restated their commitment to keep arrears to the equivalent of one month payment delay, but defended the flexible use of arrears as a cash management tool, pointing out that most of the arrears were to other government entities. The mission remarked that, even so, the arrears would eventually be passed on by these entities to their private sector creditors, with adverse effects on the pricing of services provided to the public sector, as well as on the domestic payments culture. The mission recommended, instead, that the authorities make use of their weekly treasury bill auctions to issue shorter-term paper, when necessary. Although the shortest maturity at issue is three months, paper with maturities below one-year is issued infrequently. C. The 19?9/2000 Budget 32. The staff underscored the importance of the 199912000 budget law as the first budget in which the government would be able to reflect fully its policy agenda. The budget law would have to contain concrete actions on both deficit reduction and budgetary restructuring, in order to send a strong and clear message to the private sector about the direction of policies. In the absence of new measures, the prospective loss of revenues from external tariff reductions and from the nonrenewal of the fisheries agreement, coupled with the public enterprise restructuring expenses under existing commitments would push the deficit to around 5% percent of GDP. The revenues from the second Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) license (put at around USS500 million,.or 1.2 percent of GDP) will help contain these pressures. ” The mission recommended that, in addition, the authorities take measures of some 1 percent of GDP, aiming for a deficit of around 3 percent of GDP (excluding privatization revenues). A wage and net recruitment freeze, the phasing out of food subsidies, and new tax measures along the lines discussed above would produce the 14A first step in this direction was made with STA technical assistance in February 1999, which helped assess Morocco’s statistical needs in this area. 15Although the GSM license is a nonrecurrent revenue source, it is included in revenues since it does not result in a corresponding devolution of assets as in a privatization.

Such frontloaded adjustment would put the deficit on a clear downward path, would accelerate the pace of debt reduction, and would, thereby, assure investors of stable macroeconomic conditions conducive to growth. 33. Despite evident pressures within the government to adopt a more expansionary budget, the authorities managed to present to Parliament a draft budget with a deficit target of 3.8 percent of GDP (excluding privatization receipts but including the GSM license). Tax revenue is expected to decline by 1.5 percent of GDP from the previous year (mostly on account of the 1998 tax amnesty) while noninterest expenditures would decline by much less (0.5 percent of GDP). As a result, the primary surplus is reduced from 1.9 percent of GDP in 1998/99 to 1.2 percent of GDP in 1999/2000. While the budget does not propose the restruc- turing that the staff had recommended, it is unlikely to create financing pressures to the extent that it also counts on privatization revenues of nearly 1 percent of GDP. The creation of 11,000 new budgetary positions (to be offset in part by the elimination of positions vacated through retirements), combined with discretionary salary increases in the social sector, however, goes against the objective of downsizing government and implies that the wage bill will decline only slightly in terms of GDP (to 11 .l percent). Moreover, it will require an accelerated pace of wage bill reduction in the years ahead. On food subsidies, the government opted to begin dismantling the system by recapturing the value of the subsidy going to industries that use subsidized products as an input (e.g., sugar in the beverage industry). The staff warned of the heavy administrative costs of such a differentiated subsidy scheme, as well as of the risks of leakages and distortions in favor of small-scale users not targeted for reimbursement. The budget also earmarks 1 percent of (corporate and personal) income taxes to the newly formed regional governments. As for tax measures, the authorities introduced a 20 percent tax on capital gains and reduced other tax exemptions on financial income. They also may raise excises on petroleum and tobacco products by decree, later in the year. D. Competitiveness 34. Budgetary retrenchment and restructuring, by reducing interest rates and improving the effectiveness of government spending, are necessary but not sufficient conditions to promote investment. Thus, the authorities’ strategy rests, as a third pillar, on structural reforms to improve the competitiveness of the economy and profitability. The mission noted that, in a context of fiscal consolidation and wage austerity, boosting growth to 6 percent per annum in five years’ time would have to rely on a sizable jump in export earnings. In this context, the external competitiveness of the economy takes on a central role in the dynamics of investment and growth, especially since, in a small open economy such as Morocco, technological progress and productivity gains tend to spread to the economy through the export sector. 35. A number of factors point to a significant erosion of external competitiveness in recent years (Box 5): the (CPI-based) real effective exchange rate has appreciated by 14 percent since 199 1, without any apparent offsetting improvement in productivity in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - Box 5. Morocco: Export Performance and Competitiveness Between 1980 and 1997, Morocco’s exports (measured in US dollars) increased at an average rate of 6.7 percent. This enabled Morocco to retain its world market share at 0.14 percent. The evolution, however, has been uneven: Morocco’s export share in world markets rose between 1987 and 1991 and then declined thereafter. In this last period, which is marked by an average progression of world trade of 7.7 percent, Morocco’s exports increased only at an annual rate of 4.7 percent. l Markets and products diversification - Morocco has made good use of its geographical proximity to Europe and has succeeded in raising its market share in that area, between 1980 and 1993, although it has stagnated subsequently. However, the growth of the European markets has been lower than that of the rest of the world; accordingly the country’s rising dependence on the evolution of European demand poses certain risks. - The diversification of Moroccan exports from agriculture and phosphate rock towards industrial products has been quite successful. However, the range of manufactured products currently exported by Morocco is rather limited with heavy concentration on low value added manufactures such as clothing. - Morocco’s share of the world tourism market which reached 0.55 percent in 1988, fell down to 0.32 percent by 1996. Since then, concerted efforts to sustain the sector have been made and encouraging results have been recorded in 1998, with the number of tourists visiting the country rising by 11 percent and receipts by around 19 percent in domestic currency. l Exchange rate and productivity - In the 198Os, a 33 percent real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciation of the dirham was accompanied by a sharp upturn in export volume (66 percent). In the years I between 1991 and 1998, the dirham appreciated in real terms by 14 percent, while the rate of growth of export weakened substantially. - The evidence from industry surveys-such as the ratio of value added per employee to the labor costs and the investment to value added ratio-points to stagnation or decline in productivity and profitability in the manufacturing exporting sector during the 1990s L.. 1 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - manufacturing sector;16 East Asian countries (that are not included in the effective real exchange rate index but that compete in similar products) have become more competitive through real devaluations; and Morocco’s market share in the EU (its primary export market) has stagnated since 1993, while that of Eastern European countries and other Mediterranean competitors has grown. 36. Trade liberalization. The ongoing process of trade liberalization under the Associa- tion Agreement with the EU will also increase competitive pressures. While trade hberaliza- tion will at first expose the domestic tradeable industry to greater foreign competition, requiring adjustments in both prices and the allocation of labor, it should in time be an engine of growth.” For these reasons, there would be significant benefits from accelerating liberalization and broadening it beyond the scope of the EU Association Agreement. 37. Exchange rate policy. In light of these considerations, the mission raised doubts as to whether the government’s program of structural reforms could trigger the desired surge in investment within the required time frame. Admittedly, fiscal and structural reforms would contribute to closing the competitive gap by strengthening the economic, legal, and regulatory framework for business. However, structural reforms appeared to require long gestation periods (below), and their benefits may be slow in coming. The staff, therefore, suggested that the growth strategy should include the use of a more active exchange rate policy to restore competitiveness. Similar views have been echoed in the domestic public debate on the exchange rate, most notably by private sector representatives and exporters. 38. The authorities were generally of the opinion that a more accommodating exchange rate policy carries significant risks, outweighing any potential short-term benefit. It would undermine fiscal discipline, weaken the government’s resolve to undertake difficult structural measures, and reduce pressures on enterprises to adjust. Moreover, the government would find it difficult to resist union pressures for backward-looking wage increases that would emerge from nominal exchange rate adjustments. In this context, the authorities’ preference was to consolidate the low inflation environment they had achieved. While the staff recognized the merits of these arguments, it noted that continued pursuit of a fixed exchange rate regime, particularly since it may entail further appreciation of the real exchange rate, would compromise the growth objective. Therefore, it recommended that the authorities consider a more flexible management of the exchange rate, while assigning to monetary policy (below) the role of providing a nominal anchor for the economy. The mission suggested that the authorities explore the possibility of an exit strategy, for instance by ‘“Enterprise survey data suggest that during the 1991-98 period value added per employee has been progressing at a lower rate than labor costs per employee in the textile and clothing sectors. “Because tariffs on industrial and intermediate goods will be reduced first, the initial impact may be favorable for exporters of finished goods.

The authorities felt that the current fiscal position and the limitations in domestic monetary management did not warrant a change in policy. E. Structural Reforms 39. In the government’s strategy, structural reforms are the core instrument to improve productivity and incentives to invest. The mission praised the breadth of the government’s reform agenda, which touches on all the main impediments to growth: the business environment (e.g., judicial and customs reform), employment policy (training and employment schemes for young graduates, and reforming the labor code), liberalization of prices and markets (competition law, telecommunications, and road transport liberalization), expansion of the private sector brivatization and public utility concessions), public enterprise restructuring (closure of the Charbonnages du Maroc and recapitalization of the CNCA), and social and education policies (creation of a Social Development Agency and upgrade of the Entraide Nation&). The staff raised concerns, however, about the ability of the authorities to implement this agenda at a fast enough pace to create the critical mass that would prompt the desired surge in investment. The authorities stressed that reforms were solidly under way but that the pace of reform was dictated by the need for a consensual approach. Building a consensus took time, but once a decision was taken the authorities were confident that they would have the political legitimacy to deliver. The authorities also noted that, through this process, they had been able to bring into the public debate some of the thornier issues (such as food subsidies and civil service reform). 40. The mission recognized the merits of a consensual approach, but noted that many of the issues on the table (food subsidies, the labor market code, and price liberalization) had been amply debated over the last few years and that there was little disagreement, at the technical level, on their solution. Meaningful reforms would inevitably produce losers and could not be fully consensual. The mission urged the authorities to accelerate the pace of reform in three areas: . Increasing labor market flexibility. A reform of the labor code was long overdue. Rather than strengthening employment conditions and protecting workers, very rigid dismissal rules have mainly benefited insiders and promoted the development of the informal sector, making working conditions even less stable and secure for a large share of the population. Precarious working conditions in the informal sector, in turn, have lessened incentives for enterprises to provide on the job training. The government agreed with this analysis, and indicated that a new code was being drafted in consultation with social partners, with the aim of introducing greater flexibility in ‘8SM198/45 (see paragraphs 24 and 25). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - employment practices while at the same time protecting workers. The government hoped to obtain the union’s consent by introducing, in parallel, a national unemployment and health insurance scheme, to be financed by employers and employees. The staff welcomed this initiative but urged the authorities to bring this process to a closure. It noted that the reintegration of the informal sector into the formal sector would also require reestablishing an adequate spread between the minimum wage (SMIG) and the average wage. At the very least, the SMIG should not increase further in real terms. . Accelerating privatizatioo. After a strong performance in 1996-97, the privatization process came to a near standstill in 1998. The authorities attributed this more to legislative problems (linked to the renewal of the privatization framework) than to a lack of political will. They said that the adoption of the new privatization law, providing for more flexible procedures, should get the process back in gear. In particular, they expected rapid progress in opening the capital of public enterprises to the private sector (as well as privatization) in the areas of telecommunications, banking, and transportation. . Completing the process of price and market liberalization. The staff emphasized that to fully realize the benefits of import liberalization, it is important that the liberalization of domestic prices, and of (goods and labor) markets precede import liberalization. Yet, domestic price liberalization appears to be lagging. Some of the price controls are linked to the food subsidy system, and, as noted above, specific measures in this area are slow in coming. In the transportation sector, it would also be desirable to open passenger road transport to competition and shorten the transition to full liberalization of merchandise road transport. F. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Issues 41. Monetary policy and capital flows. Despite a gradual increase in financial flows between Morocco and the rest of the world, monetary policy has retained a large degree of independence under the current exchange rate peg. Capital account liberalization (Box 6) has expanded the scope for private capital inflows, and convertible assets do show some degree of responsiveness to domestic monetary conditions. The amounts involved, however, are still relatively small and do not constrain domestic interest rate management. The limited size of portfolio flows has been one of the factors protecting Morocco from financial contagion, although in the medium term, it may also hinder the financing of investment and thus impede growth. Foreign participation in the stock market may have been held back by its limited liquidity, large sectoral concentration (mostly banks), and the presence of considerable cross holdings. 42. Still, the mission remarked that the deepening of the secondary market in treasury securities, the modemization of the stock market, and the establishment of a modem central depository (which will reduce settlement and payment risks linked to securities’ trading) should create the conditions for a more active participation of nonresidents in domestic Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3o- Box 6. Morocco: Capital Account Transactions: Degree of Openness of Capital Account and Vulnerability to Sudden Capital Flight At the time Morocco subscribed to the obligations of Article VIII in January 1993 it also liberalised a number of capital transactions. As of 1993: l Nonresidents arc authorized to engage freely in direct and portfolio investment operations and to transfer abroad any income generated, as well as the proceeds of the sale of such investments. Since then, inflows have mostly been in the form of direct investment, largely lied to privatisation. Reflecting the volume of privatization, direct investment reached 3.3 percent of GDP in 1997 but dropped to 1.1 percent in 1998. By contrast, portfolio i&lows have been small (less than 0.2 percent of GDP during the period 1995-98) although they remained positive throughout the entire period of international fmancial instability. There are no accurate statistics on the holding of financial assets by nonresidents, but the monetary authorities believe that nonresidents account for approximately 5 percent of stock market capitalization and do not hold significant amounts of fixed income securities. l Residents are authorised to borrow abroad, either directly or indirectly, to fmance domestic investment operations or commercial transactions. According to BIS records, Moroccan liabilities to BIS reporting banks totaled USS6.2 billion as of September 1998. This includes claims on the state. Of that amount, USS2.3 billion was due within a year. l Residents of foreign nationality and Moroccans residing abroad (MRA) arc authorized to hold foreign exchange accounts, as well as exporters (up to 20 percent of their foreign exchange earnings). Nonresidents and residents of foreign nationality may also hold convertible dirham accounts. Total deposit in these categories remains low, representing less than 2 percent of GDP in December 1998. In addition, a small part of the MRA accounts deposits denominated in dirhams qualities for convertibility arrangements. Total MRA deposits arc growing steadily because of alternative interest rate differentials and reached 14 percent of GDP in December 1998. To date, fmancial assets associated with portfolio movements and external borrowing seem to be too small to constitute a risk for the Moroccan economy. One way to gauge this risk is to compare the total supply of dirham assets transferable abroad and the foreign exchange liabilities of residents, on the one handi with the total foreign exchange reserves of Bank Al-Magbrib, on the other hand. As for Dccernber 1998, these transferable assets and bank loans coming due within one year altogether totaled about US$4.5 billion, compared with USS4.4 billion in foreign exchange reserves or a ratio of about I. This ratio overstates the vulnerability of reserves to a loss in confidence, to the extent that foreign exchange and convertible dirham accounts take the form of time deposits, and that nonresidents would not be able to liquidate all of their financial holdings without suffering capital losses. ‘Holdings of fmancial assets by nonresidents, bank loans coming due within a year, foreign exchange accounts, convertible dirham accounts, and 3 percent of MRA deposits.

This would help attract foreign saving and may, in time, call for a more active use of interest rate policy in the pursuit of monetary and exchange rate objectives, The staff urged the monetary authorities to monitor closely the evolution of short-term capital flows so as to be able to react in a timely fashion to new developments. At the same time, there remains large scope for attracting long-term capital flows, notably FDl with improvements in the business environment. 43. Monetary aggregates. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of domestic monetary targeting is likely to be affected by the very rapid development of domestic financial markets. Since their creation in 1996, mutual funds (partly because of the preferential tax treatment of income channeled through them) have been a preferred means of accessing the stock and the bond markets. Indeed, shares in mutual funds grew to around 11 percent of monetary assets by December 1998, constituting an attractive alternative to term deposits. Although financial innovation has not yet impacted strongly on the demand for broad money (M3), the central bank was considering recasting its monetary targets in terms of a narrower aggregate and/or a credit aggregate. The mission recommended that, while retaining M3 as a target, possibly broadened to a target range, the central bank monitor a wider range of indicators so as to be in a stronger position to determine the need for corrective interest rate action in the future. 44. The monetary policy framework. The mission underscored the need to upgrade the central bank’s instruments of intervention and its operational rules (Box 7) in order to control better monetary conditions on a day-to-day basis. While volatility in money market rates contains useful information and should not be suppressed, the mission made the point that the central bank should be in a position to prevent the money market rate from moving outside the intervention band. In particular, the mission recommended that the Treasury, the cash management unit of the Ministry of Finance (Trchrerie G&&ale du Royaume), and the central bank coordinate their projections of the government’s liquidity requirements so as to avoid unnecessary liquidity shocks. Indeed, regular meetings among the three agencies have been taking place since then. In view of the considerable deepening of the secondary market in treasury paper, the mission considered that conditions were ripe for experimenting with open market and repurchase operations. With the improvement in monetary control procedures, the central bank should be in a better position to inject and mop up liquidity as needed. Once these instruments are fully developed, it might be possible for the central bank to consider lowering or remunerating reserve requirements from their current high lcvcl (10 percent). 45. Banking sector. The large intermediation margins of the banking system (based on reported loan rates), and its seemingly collusive practices have been an ongoing concern for the authorities and the staff. This time, encouragingly, the mission found signs of increasing competition within the banking system, notably on lending rates. Still, strong links between the main banks and the large domestic corporations, as well as the impediments that exist to lending to the small and medium-sized enterprises sector (e.g., difficult recovery of collateral, inadequate capacity to present viable projects), imply that scope for competition remains limited. One such source has come from the rapid development of mutual funds, which has pushed commercial banks to compete more aggressively for funds. The mission also noted Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - Box 7. Morocco: Monetary Policy Instruments and the Overnight Interbank Rate Apart from reserve requirements, the statutes of the central bank (Bank Al-M&rib) give it four instruments of monetary intervention: . weekly seven-day liquidity auctions that set the floor leading rate; . a five-day repurchase window (available twice a week) that sets the ceiling leading rate; . advances, at a penalty rate, to cover eventual debit position at the end of the day; and . open-market operations (in treasury bills), which, however, Bank Al-Maghrib has never made use of due tc the insufficient liquidity of the secondary market. Despite the availability of such instruments of control, the overnight interbank rate has tended to be very volatilei and even mom SO since early 1997. On several occasions, the rate has fluctuated outside of the band defmed by the two leading rates and, more frequently, below it. This situation is attributable to a combination of three factors: . First, the Treasury did not provide liquidity estimates to Bank Al-Maghrib, and the estimate assessments that the latter had to make were often thwarted by unexpected changes in Treasury operations. . Bank Al-Maghrib does not have an instrument for daily interventions (outside of open-market operations). . The Moroccan interbank market remains relatively narrow and thus inherently volatile. In these circumstances, the interbank rate has not been able to play its role as an anchor for interest rates in the Moroccan economy. Volatility of the interbank rate outside the intervention band can be seen as the consequent of a limited ability-by the cenbal bank to control monetary conditions. d Bank Al-Maghrib’s intervention rates and the overnight interbank rate, January 1996-December 1998 9.0% 9.0% 8.5% 8.5% 8.0% 8.0% 7.5% 7.5% 7.0% 7.0% 6.5% 4.5% 6.0% 6.0% 5.5% 5.5% 5.0% 5.0% 4.5% 4.5% s 55% 323 3 I -..- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 33 - that commercial banks’s risk assessment capacities may need to be upgraded as the economy opens up to world capital markets. Finally, it observed that the foreign exchange transaction levy (0.2 percent) had contributed to displacing foreign exchange transactions to off-shore markets, and recommended its elimination. IV. STATISTICS AND Y2K READINESS 46. The Moroccan authorities regularly provide economic and financial statistics to both MED and STA, allowing for regular surveillance. Most data provided to the Fund are also published and/or posted on publicly accessible web sites.” Following a multisector statistical mission in April 1998, the authorities have set up an action plan to upgrade their statistical systems in order to qualify for SDDS by the end of 1999. In this framework, a national account statistics mission has provided technical assistance to revise the methodology for the calculation of quarterly GDP for SDDS compliance and has followed up on a few other pending issues (e.g., the production of the revised volume and value indices for external trade). In February, a government finance and money and banking statistics mission visited Morocco to examine the information available on local government fiscal operations and provided technical assistance to produce consolidated general government accounts. The mission was also able to resolve reporting problems that had emerged following the revision of monetary and banking statistics in early 1998 (to include the accounts of public credit institutions). 47. Morocco was late in dealing with the issue of year 2000 changeover. A national organization to monitor this issue was set up in mid-1998. Since then, a number of actions have been undertaken, the last of which was a questionnaire sent to 1,800 enterprises. The answers provided suggest that the financial, the telecommunication, and the air transportation sectors should be ready for the changeover. On the other hand, there is some concern about the readiness of the electricity production sector and small and medium size enterprises. Half of the banks have declared to be ready for the changeover, the other half intends to be ready by the end of July; and there will be no real difficulty regarding interbank systems which are not very computerized. Except for multinational enterprises, no contingency plan has been prepared yet, pending a final assessment of the readiness of the main operators this summer. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 48. Sound macroeconomic management, based on tight demand management and strong budgetary execution, has given Morocco an enviable and commendable record of internal and external stability. Inflation has stabilized at around 2% percent per year and the external 19At present, the Statistics directorate, the Treasury, and the Office des Changes post monthly data in their web sites with one to three months delay.

On the downside, the agricultural sector has been plagued by the effects of droughts, which have been magnified by price distortions which favor drought-sensitive crops; and growth in the nonagricultural sector has tended to decline to a level insufficient to provide jobs to all new job entrants, let alone to the large number of unemployed. Underlying this inadequate growth performance are insufficient public and private investments, partly linked to economic and political uncertainties, and an export sector which has suffered losses in market share relative to its main competitors from emerging market economies. Social indicators have also been lagging, and there remain important gaps in housing and education 50. The government that came into power in February of 1998 aptly made it its priority to improve social conditions and raise economic growth. It elaborated an ambitious medium- term strategy to meet this challenge, with emphasis on raising public saving, restructuring government expenditures to achieve better social targeting, and pursuing the liberalization of the economy. The staff endorses the objectives of the strategy and its emphasis on fiscal consolidation, budgetary restructuring, and structural reforms. However, these objectives have yet to be fully articulated in concrete measures. 51. The authorities’ main fiscal target is to raise public saving by 2.5-3.0 percent of GDP over the medium term and to reduce the budget deficit to under 2 percent by 2001/02. Starting from a structural deficit of 5-5.5 percent of GDP, and with the prospects of declining customs tariff revenues, the deficit objective will require forceful action on both the expenditure and revenue sides. Taking advantage of relatively favorable economic conditions presently, it would have been appropriate to aim for a deficit target of around 3 percent of GDP (excluding privatization revenues) in FY 1999/2000, centered on the containment of the government wage bill, the gradual elimination of generalized food subsidies, and a tax reform. This would have set the stage for durable fiscal adjustment which would, in turn, make room for increased public investment, in both social and physical infrastructure. 52. While the draft budget presented to Parliament manages to contain expenditure growth in the face of mounting social pressures, and does not imperil macroeconomic equilibria, it does not make much headway toward deficit reduction and budgetary restructuring. It thereby puts at risk the medium-term fiscal and growth objectives that the government has set out for itself. Moreover, the further net increase in the size of the civil service goes against the downsizing objective of the government. 53. The pattern of addressing social demands by increasing the government payroll needs to be reversed. A thorough reform of the civil service is required to achieve the desired reduction in the wage bill, while reinforcing the effectiveness of the civil service. Because the implementation of such a reform could be both lengthy and costly, there is some urgency to put in place an action plan for civil service reform and to meet social spending needs as much as possible through redeployment of personnel. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public_ 3s - 54. The system of generalized food subsidies has by now fully revealed its limitations and should be replaced with better targeted forms of social support. The favorable price developments for subsidized food items in international markets still afford an excellent opportunity for the authorities to begin phasing out food subsidies, and replacing them where necessary with direct and temporary financial support to domestic producers. The attention paid by the government to improving social conditions in the country is commendable, and the creation of a Social Development Agency is an important step in this direction. 55. The process of fiscal retrenchment needs to be supported by a well-functioning tax system. Repeated amnesties and a cumulation of exemptions have undermined the effectiveness and the yield of the tax system. Capturing sectors of the economy that are either untaxed or undertaxed should be a priority, and will require reforms both at the administrative level and in the tax legislation. The staff fully supports the authorities’ desire to upgrade the tax administration and to strengthen the taxation of financial income. It also encourages the authorities to increase the yield of the indirect tax system by harmonizing VAT rates and excises, broadening of the tax base, and removing VAT deductibility for agricultural inputs, in as much as the agricultural sector is exempt from any form of taxation, 56. Exchange rate policy has played a central role in the successful disinflation of the economy. The nominal exchange rate anchor has also served to enforce fiscal discipline and to promote structural change in enterprises. In light of this, the authorities’ hesitance to changing tack is understandable. However, in a small open economy, the level of the exchange rate and the ability to adjust it to changes in the external environment also have important implications for economic activity and growth. Having now established a record of price stability, the exchange rate instrument could be used more flexibly in support of the government’s growth strategy, especially in a context where domestic monetary control instruments are being reinforced and could be used more effectively to contain inflationary pressures. The staff recommends that the authorities consider an exit strategy from the fixed exchange rate regime and that, as a first step, they avoid any further real appreciation by adjusting the exchange rate on a regular basis. 57. The development of domestic financial markets and the gradual integration of Morocco into world financial markets will present new constraints and challenges to monetary policy, in terms of the choice of intermediate targets and operating procedures. The staff welcomes the attention given by the central bank to these issues and encourages the authorities to monitor more broadly domestic financial developments and external financial flows, To begin, the authorities should strive to contain the movements of the interbank money rate within the corridor defined by the central bank’s intervention rates. The recent 50 basis points reduction of the intervention rates in effect accommodated a situation of excess liquidity (relative to the central bank’s intervention rate), and thereby brought the market rate back within the intervention corridor. With inflationary pressures remaining very subdued, such a reduction may well be justified. Further easing of monetary conditions should be delayed, however, until progress toward fiscal consolidation has been firmly established.

Structural reforms touched all the main impediments to growth and should result in some productivity gains. However, the pace of reform slowed down in the course of the current budget year (1998/99). A number of essential reforms that still have to be undertaken are on the government’s reform agenda, including the liberalization of the labor code, the resumption of privatization, and further price and market liberalization. The authorities’ consensual approach to these difficult issues has had the merits of bringing them out into the open. However, the govetmnent will need to take bold actions in these areas in support of its growth objective. A quickening of the pace of structural reforms is essential to induce the desired leap in productivity and investment. The staff also encourages the authorities to accelerate trade liberalization and to broaden it beyond the scope of the EU Association Agreement. 59. Financial market development has been impressive and rests on generally sound institutions. In light of the rapid development of mutual funds (including money market funds), attention should be given to reinforcing their regulation and supervision. The restructuring of public credit institutions appears to be on track and the proposed establishment of direct budgetary support for the noncommercial activities of the agricultural bank should help protect its balance sheet in the future-as well as ensure fiscal transparency. To avoid the obvious risk of moral hazard, it is essential, however, that this scheme not create new contingent liabilities for the budget associated with lending to nonviable farmers. Further privatization of state-owned credit institutions should enhance the efficiency of financial intermediation. 60. The production and dissemination of economic and social statistics have improved markedly over the last few years, and the authorities’ efforts to make them available to the wider public through the Internet are commendable. Further efforts are needed to improve the quality and timeliness of government finance statistics, particularly as regards the consolidated accounts of the general government. 61. In all, the staff welcomes the medium-term objectives of the authorities. Still, the 1999/2000 budget could have been more ambitious toward meeting these objectives, by targeting a deficit closer to 3 percent of GDP. The staff hopes that the slower pace of structural reform simply reflects the time needed by the coalition government to formulate a coherent strategy of economic policies. Nevertheless, the authorities’ growth objective may be beyond reach within the time frame they have set for themselves, unless the pace of reform and budgetary restructuring and consolidation is accelerated soon. 62. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Morocco be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Policy loans A Contractual Savings Developments Loan (CSDL) for an amount of US$lOO million was approved by the Executive Board in June 1998. It was cofinanced by the African Development Bank for additional 100 million ECU, The CSDL intends to support fhe momentum of financial sector reform and aims at (i) improving the capacity of the insurance companies to collect savings and invest; (ii) creating the foundation for private capitalized pension funds and other fund management mechanisms; (iii) changing the role of CDG in the collection, administration and allocation of the financial resources of insurance and pension systems; and (iv) continuing to improve the financial markets and providing a spectrum of diversified instruments to investors. A single tranche Policy Reform Support Loan (PRSL) for US$250 million has been negotiated in the second semester of 1998 and is now expected to be presented to the Executive Board in June 1999. Parallel financing of US$200 million by the African Development Bank (ADB) has already been approved. The PRSL is to support government’s commitment to establish and maintain a sound macroeconomic framework and to implement a broad reform program covering public sector reform, private sector development and poverty reductions and human resource development. A US$ 100 million two tranche Telecommunication Sector Adjustment Loan has been negotiated in late 1998. This loan supports the liberalization of the telecommunication sector in Morocco, and in particular the concession of a second GSM licence for mobile phone operator. The loan has been approved by the Executive Board on May 6, 1999. Project loans During fiscal year 1997, the following loans were approved: a Vocational Training project (USS23 million) and a RailRoad Restructuring project (US%85 million). During fiscal year 1998, to date, the following loans were approved: a Municipal Finance project (lJS$70 million); a Rural Water Supply project (US$lO million) and a Water Resource project (US$ZO million). In the current fiscal year 1999 the Fez Rehabilitation project (US% 14 million), the Health Management project (US$ 66 million) and the Lakhdar Watershed Management project (USS 4 million) have been approved.

In 1998, the Statistics Office prepared a medium-term strategy for the development of national statistics. A framework law on statistics, providing for additional budgetary allocations, was also approved. Following the Fund’s multisector statistics mission in April 1998, the authorities started implementing an action plan for the upgrading of the country’s statistical system and have received Fund technical assistance on real sector, monetary and public finance statistics. The authorities continue to make efforts to further improve the frequency, quality, and timeliness of economic data, particularly in light of their intention to subscribe to the SDDS. Real sector During 1998 Morocco reported a complete series of national accounts data extending through 1997. The Statistics Office started the preliminary publication of quarterly GDP data, which are reported to the Fund. A technical assistance mission from STA visited Morocco in December 1998 to assess the methodology used for the computation of quarterly GDP, and to suggest improvements in order to comply with SDDS requirements. The mission also followed up on progress concerning the implementation of STA recommendations on the revision of price indices. The mission found that resources made available to the Statistics Office have been significantly increased. Although the quarterly GDP are now produced with commendable timeliness, they suffer from some methodological problems, and lack of coordination between the Statistical Office and other data providers. Concerning the annual accounts, the base year (1980) is obsolete and an independent estimate of household final consumption expenditures is lacking. The progress on rebasing the producer price index and wholesale price index has been slow. A complete revision of the consumer price index will only be worthwhile once the results of the new household budget survey (scheduled for October 1999-September 2000) are available. Quarterly data on urban employment derived from the employment survey regularly conducted by the Statistics Office are now posted on the Internet as soon as available. The implementation of recommendations from the 1996 STA technical assistance mission concerning the methodology for producing volume indices for exports and imports of manufactured goods has been completed. The Statistics Office, in cooperation with the Of/ice des Changes, has developed a preliminary veTsion of disaggregated indices for the year 1994-96 (on a 1993 basis). The new indices will soon be published in IFS. Government finance Central government finance data are generally available to MED with a few months lag (budget figures are available through March 1999). GFS data reported by Morocco are not Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - APPENDIX III timely, and annual data through 1995 were received by STA in September 1997. In addition, their coverage is limited to the budget of the central government, the Moroccan pension fund, the National Social Security Fund, and partial information on the extrabudgetary funds. The compilation suffers from errors and omission. No data far the central government on a monthly or quarterly basis are repotted to STA for publication in IFS. A technical assistance mission from STA was in Rabat in February 1999 to assist the government in establishing appropriate consolidation procedures for a presentation of general government data. The mission noted areas for further improvement in the compilation of both central and local government statistics. Monetary accounts Monetary data were revised in 1998 and reporting to STA was disrupted as a consequence. In order to resume regular reporting and to integrate data from the former development banks into the monthly report to STA, the STA technical assistance mission of February 1999 assisted Bank Al Maglnib (BAM) with the preparation of a framework apt to translate the new monetary series into IFS statistics. Accordingly, IFS publication of Moroccan monetary statistics is expected to resume shortly. In addition, in 1998, BAM published two special issues of its Statistical Bulletin to cover statistical information for the period 1983-97, which had been interrupted in the mid-1980s. BAM plans to resume timely publication of the Statistical Bulletin on a quarterly basis in 1999. It is also to be noted that, from early 1998, BAM has been reporting weekly to MED its holding of foreign reserves. Balance of payments With the increasing liberalization of foreign borrowing, the recording of private foreign debt, in particular short term debt, needs to be improved. In light of the relatively large errors and omissions that emerged in the 1995 and 1996 balance of payments, the authorities undertook a reexamination of procedures and underlying documentation, with a view to correcting misclassification by the banking system of some tourism-related transactions. In October 1998, the Of/ice des Changes has published revised balance of payments data through 1997. Since May 1998, the Office des Ch&ges has been publishing, in its new Internet site, monthly statistics on trade, tourism, private transfers, and incoming foreign direct investment. These data are available within a lag of between two and three months.
