This was due to the liberalization of domestic activities and of the exchange and trade system, as well as, since 1997, tighter demand management policies. Growth has averaged about 5 percent per annum in recent years, and inflation fell sharply in 1998. During September-December 1998, the authorities continued to adhere to.tight demand management polices, Performance in terms of inflation, the budget, and the balance of payments for 1998 as a whole was broadly in line with the program. However, the monetary outcome was more expansionary than anticipated, as the end-December,ceiling on net domestic credit was breached. This was partially reversed in January-February through corrective measures, which succeeded in lessening the usual seasonal pressures on the exchange rate. Inflation rose in January-March, from the very low level of December, reflecting in part an unseasonal fall in the same period of the previous year. The medium-term program, which could be monitored by the staff, aims at maintaining growth of 5-5.5 percent during 1999-2001, and gradually reducing inflation to 5 percent. However, only limited progress towards external viability will be possible, as poor political relations with some creditors prevent full debt regularization. Nevertheless, a gradual improvement in the external position is envisaged to enable a moderate build-up of external reserves and increased debt service payments that would allow for the normalization of relations with some creditors and a resumption of assistance. In the macroeconomic area, the strategy is to: (i) further reduce domestic government borrowing, and thus bring down money growth and inflation, in the context of a flexible exchange rate regime; (ii) increase investment in the physical and social infrastructure financed through the onset of oil revenues in late 1999 and supported by the introduction of the value added tax (VAT) as well as a reduction of exemptions; and (iii) enhance the authorities’s ability to conduct monetary policy with new indirect policy instruments, while reducing reserve requirements, The main structural policies are: (i) trade liberalization, with Sudan’s trade system moving from restrictive to open on the basis of the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness; (ii) fiuther developing fiscal transparency, including revising the classification of budgetary data to provide more useful information; (iii) giving more. priority to social spending, and beginning with efforts to obtain more useful social data and make social spending by states more effective; (iv) intensifying efforts to improve bank supervision, with Fund technical assistance; and (v) persevering with privatization and improving the regulatory environment. In the appraisal, the staff emphasizes the need for: (i) careful management of banks liquidity to avoid the recurrence of pressures on prices and the exchange rate of early 1999; (ii) further corrective measures if recent inflationary pressures do not abate; (iii) a market-determined exchange rate regime and for the exchange rate to absorb exogenous shocks and shifts in money demand; and (iv) timely implementation of structural policies.

Discussions on the 1999 Article IV consultation and Sudan’s performance under the fourth quarterly review of the 1998 staffmonitored program (SMP) for 1998 were held in Khartoum during March 2-18, 1999. Understandings were also reached on a medium-term program of adjustment and structural reforms for the period 1999-2001 that could be monitored by the staff This report provides the mission’s findings on recent performance and discusses the objectives and policies of the medium-term program, as described in the attached Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP) 1999-2001 addressed to the Managing Director and dated April 26,1999. 2. Directors’ views. On February 24, 1999 the Executive Board conducted the third review under the 1998 SMP, the six-monthly review of Sudan’s overdue financial obligations to the Fund, and the twelve-monthly review of the Managing Director’s complaint with regard to compulsory withdrawal. The Board welcomed Sudan’s continued adherence to the economic policies and payments to the Fund agreed under the 1998 SMP. In light of the adverse impact of the late summer flooding, Directors endorsed the authorities’ request for a reduction in payments to the Fund in 1999. They also welcomed the adoption of an adjust- ment and reform program for 1999, and urged the authorities to complete discussions with the staff on a medium-term program that could be monitored by the staff 3. Impact of the floods. The impact of the floods on the productive capacity of the irrigated sector has been more severe than described in EBS/99/11 (l/28/99) (Box I), so that the livelihood of over 2 million people is at risk. Little external assistance has been received so far, although Saudi Fund grants expected in 1999 will mostly be directed to flood rehabilitation. II. BACKGROUND 4. Sudan’s economic decline in 1970s and 1980s. Sudan had gone through, until recently, a prolonged period of economic decline that has been reflected in a deteriorating infrastructure and social services, and a reduction in per capita GDP. This, combined with terms of trade losses, had resulted in an erosion of living standards, widespread poverty and food insecurity. Sudan’s economic decline was in large part attributable to policy deficiencies over a long period, aggravated by internal conflict and frequent natural disasters. Efforts to undertake policy reform during the 198Os, with substantial financial support from the Fund, World Bank, and other sources were ineffectual. Moreover, excessive government control and intervention was reflected in, inter alia, negative real rates of return and charge, administered credit allocation, and usually overvalued official exchange rates, which resulted in resource misallocation, shrinking foreign trade, exhaustion of exchange reserves, and accumulation of an enormous external debt. Fiscal performance was hampered by a narrow and inelastic revenue base, price rigidities, and weak expenditure control; large fiscal deficits resulted in sizable government recourse to domestic bank financing and rapid monetary expansion.

Sudan: Economic Growth and Diversification, 1992/93-98 l The economy of Sudan has been growing robustly in recent years, with real GDP growth rate averaging about 5 percent per annum during the paiod from 1992I93 to 1998. There has also been considerable inter- and &a-sectoral economic diversification. This pezformance follows years of economic stagnation and sharp output swings. The growth and diversification have been fueled by a combination of strong supply response to the implemzntation of the libemlization policies and to the relatively favorable weather conditions. l The refornx in the agricultural sector focused on liberal&g the pricing, crop selection, and marketing of all agricultural products, dismantling or transforming into publicly owned companies all agricultural marketing monopolies, and privatizing key veterimuy services. Reform in other sectors concentrated on eliminating subsidies and industrial planning, liberalizing industrial prices, launching an ambitious privatization program and liberalizing the investment regime (including opening all economic sectors to private investment). . Agriculture (including livestock and forestry), which accounts for about 40 percent of GDP, grew by an average of 5 percent during 1992/93-98, with substantial diversification taking place within the sector. This growth was led by strong performances in non-traditional crops (including fruits and vegetables) and livestock, which grew by an average of about 24 percent and 11 percent respectively, contributing 3.3 and 2.9 percentage points, respectively, to agricultural growth The traditional crops sector grew by an average of 5.8 percent during 1992/93-98, with growth led by the rainfed segments which grew by 14 percent, while the output of the irrigated sector (traditionally the dominant sector) declined by an average of about 1.5 percent. The weak performance of the irrigated sector reflezts the elimination of gov emment financing and the lack of suflicient investment in irrigation infrastructure. . The industrial sector has also responded well to reforms, despite limitations on electricity generation capacity, with its share in GDP rising from 5.5 percent in 1992/93 to 9.2 percant in 1998. . The economic response to reforms was also retlected in improved export performance, which in turn contributed to the sustainability of economic growth Exports rose from US%422 million in 1994195 to US.%596 million in 1998, with strong growth in export volumes during 1996-98, avaaging about 7.3 percent per annum In addition, the share of livestock and non-traditional exports in total exports increased from 38 percent in 1994/95 to 46 percent in 1998, while the share of traditional exports (cotton, groundnuts, sesame and gum arabic) declined from 57 percent to 53 percent during the same period.

Because of the lack of sustained implementation, efforts to tighten demand management policies during this period collapsed quickly, leading to an acceleration in inflation. Nevertheless, progress was made in restoring economic growth tiy allowing freer operation of market forces, as well as enhancing the role of the private sector. In particular, the prices of most consumer goods and services were liberalized, and agricultural production was decontrolled (Box 1). 6. Progress in stabilization and, structural reform during 1997-98. The liberalization process begun in the mid-1990s was broadened and supplemented in 1997-98 through the tightening of macroeconomic policies. The revival of economic growth was sustained by strong increases in export volume and private transfers, partly in response to the liberalisation of the exchange system, and the opening of all sectors, including utilities and the oil sector, to private sector participation (Box 2). ICI. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE A. Macroeconomic Developments 7. Performance under the 1998 SMP. During September-December, the authorities continued to adhere to tight demand management policies. Performance in terms of inflation, the budget and the balance of payments was broadly in line with the estimates/projections provided in the third review. However, the monetary outcome was modestly more expan- sionary than anticipated, as the end-December target on net domestic credit was not met (Attachment I, Table l), although this was partially reversed in January-February. The outcome for 1998 8. Good growth performance. In 1998, real GDP is estimated to have grown by 5 percent (6.6 percent in 1997) sustaining the improved growth performance evident since the mid-1990’s (Table 1). There was a decline in most traditional agricultural crops, from the exceptionally high levels recorded in 1997, reflecting: (i) a mixed pattern of rainfall and a reduction in the planted area of some rainfed crops, induced by lower prices; and (ii) the adverse impact of weak maintenance on the infrastructure of irrigated agriculture. However, this decline was offset by strong growth in the livestock, manufacturing and some service sectors, as well as the more rapid-than-anticipated construction of the oil pipeline. 9. Further reduction in inflation. The average rate of inflation declined from 47 percent in 1997 to 17 percent in 1998, with year-on-year inflation at end-December at only 8 percent (Table 1 and Chart 1). Apart from the sustained implementation of tight financial policies and some decreases in import prices, the outcome in December was influenced by an exceptional decline in sorghum prices.

As part of the government’s efforts to liberalize the economy, a major shift in its policy regarding the oil sector occurred in 1997 with the gradual opening of the importation and distribution of oil products to private sector participation. These activities had been the domain of the government through the Government Petroleum Corporation (GPC), now the Sudan Petroleum Corporation (SPC). As a result, the number of players involved in the sector has increased considerably and some imports of crude and diesel were carried out by the private sector for the first time in 1998. Nevertheless, the SPC still remains involved to an important degree in the importation and distribution of diesel and gasoline, either on its own or in conjunction with private enterprises. This is because the private sector has often been unable to secure foreign and/or local financing, or storage facilities. The role of the private sector is expected to be facilitated with the coming on stream of oil production. . In 1998, out of total imports amounting to US%256 million (customs data), the SPC imported on its own or jointly with other enterprises close to 70 percent. The decreasing role of the SPC in the imports of the sector has translated into lower foreign exchange payments by the BOS, thus sustaining the reduced export surrender requirements called for by the liberalization of the exchange system. Thus, BOS payments for oil products decreased from US%234 million in 1996 to an average of about US$ 80 million in 1997-98. This has been accompanied by the emergence of a new modality of financing by private traders, through the purchase of export crops (other than cotton and gum arabic) to generate the foreign exchange required to pay for imports of oil products subsequently sold to the SPC for distribution. l In parallel with the above change in policy, the govermnent has also eliminated subsidies on domestic oil products. At the beginning of ,l997, prices were increased to both eliminate subsidies and generate revenues for the budget through an implicit tax in the form of a price differential. In August 1997, prices were again increased and have been maintained unchanged since then, even though international oil prices declined thereby generating sizable revenues for the budget. Under the tariff and excise reform effective since October 1998, this price differential has been replaced by specific excises.

The budget deficit (on a cash basis) was held at 0.7 percent of GDP (Table 2), unchanged from 1997 despite flood related outlays, through a determined policy of reducing expenditures whenever revenue shortfalls threatened to com- promise the attainment of the fiscal target. A key factor behind these shortfalls was a weaker performance of taxes on international trade, owing to a shill in the structure of imports toward tax-exempt (under the Investment Encouragement Act) or low-tariff commodities.’ Despite the shortfall, compared with the program, revenue was over 40 percent higher in the last quarter in relation to the equivalent period in 1997, and by 1.3 percentage points of GDP (to 8 percent of GDP) over the year as a whole. This performance reflected the combined impact of the discretionary measures and improved tax administration.* Domestically financed development outlays rose in relation to 1997, by 0.2 percent of GDP to 0.6 percent in 1998,3 despite bearing a larger share of the expenditure restraint burden. Adherence to the budget deficit target enabled the government to keep its gross borrowing from the BOS in line with the program ceiling, although the use of deposits was slightly higher than expected. 11. ~Monetary growth exceeds target mddestly but slows substantially from 1997. In anticipation of the usual seasonal credit pressures of year-end and associated stress on the exchange rate, the BOS maintained tight credit conditions during the last quarter, including a reduction of its outstanding net finance to banks in December, supplemented by an increase in the net sales of the Central Bank Musharaka Certificates (CMCs); consequently, excess bank reserves fell to a low level at year-end. However, as the demand for cash exceeded the limited credit available from the banking sector-which was in line with the program projections- the private sector converted deposits into cash. Concurrently, a similar move into cash took place with respect to the deposits held at the BOS by autonomous public agencies (not considered as part of the central government) towards the end of December (Table 3)’ ‘For more information on the remaining factors, see EBS/99/11 (l/28/99), page 8 ‘Key factors behind the revenue performance included: (i) stepped up direct tax revenue collection efforts; (ii) the elimination of exemptions for public sector imports; (iii) the implementation of the tariff and excise reform in effect since October, (iv) the full-year effect of using the more depreciated Bank of Sudan (BOS) exchange rate for customs valuation purposes; (v) higher than anticipated profit transfers from public enterprises; and (vi) increases in fees and charges. ‘Military outlays in 1998 amounted to the equivalent of 2.25 percent of GDP, in line with the budgeted amount. Spending on wages exceeded the budget, but this was offset by lower spending on goods and services. Federal social expenditures amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP, although the brunt of these expenditures is borne by the states. ‘This reaction may have been the result of misinterpretation of a government circular that reminded ministries to return their deposits to the main government account before the end of the year.

As a result, broad money (at the end-1997 constant exchange rate) exceeded the target by only 1 percent, but within broad money there was a marked shift into cash which led to a larger than programmed monetary base (Table 4). Nevertheless, for the year as a whole, monetary growth slowed from 37 percent in 1997 to below 30 percent in 1998 and velocity was reduced by about 10 percent. Indeed, several money and credit indicators suggested that the process of dis-intermediation has started to be reversed (Chart 2). 12. Pressures on the pound in December. After a period of relative stability, the 14-day moving average rate depreciated by 2.5 percent between December 10 (when the pressures started to re-emerge) and end-December. This brought the cumulative depreciation of the market rate for the year as a whole to 33 percent. In real effective terms, the depreciation amounted to 13 percent (period average) for 1998 (Chart 3). 13. Balance of payments performance in line with expectations. Balance of payments developments were shaped by: (i) tight demand management policies, and the depreciation of the real exchange rate, which together with lower world market prices for oil products, reined in nominal import growth.(excluding imports for the construction of the pipeline); and (ii) a favorable response of private transfers to the improved functioning of the foreign exchange market, as evidenced by an increased use of official channels. The value of exports in 1998 remained virtually unchanged in relation to 1997, as a 6-7 percent decline in prices was fully offset by another strong volume increase (Table 5). The export volume response, which over the period 1996-98 amounted to 26 percent, was largely attributable to the recent structural reforms, including reduced export taxation, the liberalization of the exchange and trade system, and the privatization of key livestock facilities. When the oil- pipeline related imports are excluded, the current account deficit narrowed from 5.1 percent of GDP in 1997 to 4.1 percent in 1998, below the projected level. The overall balance was consistent with the projections and the targeted improvement in the net foreign asset position of the BOS was exceeded slightly, entailing an increase in gross usable reserves of US%7 million and a net reduction in arrears to the Fund of US!S20 million. 14. Bank soundness developments. The system of bank supervision in Sudan is still developing and it is difficult to make a full assessment of the soundness of the banking system. The BOS is now in the process of assessing end-1998 compliance with the capital adequacy ratio (7 banks fell short of meeting this requirement in 1997); the review is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 1999. A new system for provisioning against non-performance loans is now operational. The new system segments the provisioning into tiers according to the length of delinquency and is applied to non- performing loans based on monthly data from banks, All banks are in compliance with the provisioning requirement.

BOS counteracts seasonal demand pressures in December 1998-February 1999. During this period, credit demand emanating from the need to finance agriculture and trade, as well as spending associated with Ramadan, related holidays, and bonus payments, was anticipated to be very strong. In the event, the expected pressures did materialize, and were compounded by the lowering of the BOS indicative minimum rates for Murabaha. However, their impact on the exchange rate in relation to the previous year was more moderate, which suggests that the countervailing measures were effective. These measures included an increase in reserve requirements on domestic currency deposits (by 2 percentage points to 28 percent) in early January and limited extension of financing by the BOS to banks despite increased demand, thereby constraining private sector credit expansion. Concurrently, the central government ran a surplus during January-February by postponing some spending until March. These measures limited the depreciation of the pound to 2-3 percent in January-February, although it was under significant pressures in some periods. Consumer prices rose by 3.3 percent between end-December and end-March, in part due to disruptions in the supply of edible oil caused by the difficulties in the irrigated sector and a recovery in sorghum prices. However, year-on-year inflation rose to almost 19 percent in March 1999, reflecting a sharp non-seasonal decline in the same month a year earlier. B. Structural Reforms 16. Progress in implementing structural reforms. With the introduction of the Government Musharaka Certificate (GMC),’ a government funding instrument based on Islamic principles, all the structural measures envisaged for 1998 will have been implemented, except for the introduction of the VAT.6 Nevertheless, delays were incurred in virtually all areas, reflecting Sudan’s limited administrative capacity and the technical complexity of some of the measures, so that many of the benchmarks were initially missed. 17. Fiscal reforms. With the October excise and tariff reform package, the base for improving tax elasticity and efficiency has been laid. This reform has paved the way for the implementation of a VAT. Although agreement has now been reached between the federal government and the states on the revenue sharing formula, it will not be possible to introduce the VAT on July 1, as envisaged. In view of the importance of the reforms steps for states’ finances, more time is needed for discussion of the law and of the required constitutional amendment, after Parliament reconvenes in late April. On the expenditure side, the ‘Enabling documents for the GMC have been signed and the Minister of Finance announced the instrument at a press conference. The first sales are expected in the first half of May. %ructural benchmarks for December, related entirely to the implementation of the VAT, were therefore not met, as VAT preparations are continuing.

In addition, the preparation of the ~1999 budget has for the first time been harmonized with the govemment macroeconomic objectives. 18. Monetary reforms. The central bank has been provided with a new instrument for short-term monetary management, the CMC, which has won the acceptance of the market but is still of limited scale and effectiveness as a monetary policy tool. In addition, legal reserve requirements are now based on weekly averages of reservable liabilities with the objective of increasing their responsiveness to short-term fluctuations in the deposit base. Finally, the BOS established a standing finance facility at higher-than-market financing rates with uniform rules of access, with a view to increasing transparency and eliminating distortions in the allocation of central bank finance. 19. Foreign exchange market was unified. The role of the Joint Committee in setting the official exchange rate ceased in October. Foreign exchange regulations and a Code of Conduct were issued in February 1999. The foreign exchange market is still thin which resulted in quite a large range of transactions on any particular day (2-3 percent). The BOS now posts a five-day moving average rate based on market transactions, that is calculated daily, and is mainly used for budgetary transactions and those transactions relating to remaining surrender requirements.’ The divergence between the moving average rate and the average rate of transactions on any particular day is usually small, and the authorities have undertaken to keep it to less than 2 percent irrespective of the five-day formula. There is relatively little active commercial bank intermediation; no bank has assumed a market maker role yet. IV. REPORTONTHEDISCUSSIONS 20. The discussions focused on: (i) the medium-term challenges facing the authorities and the appropriate strategy for dealing with them; (ii) the suitability of the earlier agreed 1999 program and of the current macroeconomic policy stance; (iii) the medium-term policies needed to meet the macroeconomic and social objectives; and (iv) the risks facing the macroeconomic program. A. The Medium-Term Program (1999-2001) The macroeconomic strategy, key challenges, and objectives 21. Medium-term strategy. The authorities’ goal is to achieve sustainable and more rapid economic growth and, eventually, external viability. To this end, they seek to: (i) create the conditions for a permanent increase in investment and savings, by building on the ‘The number of days in the calculation of the moving average exchange rate was reduced from 14 days to 10 days in December, and further to 5 days in March.

While encouraged by the headway made under the 1997 and 1998 SMPs, the authorities stated that the major impediments to achieving their goals were: + prolonged meager investment in physical and human capital. This has resulted in: (i) the serious deterioration of the intrastructure in the irrigated agriculture, energy and transportation sectors, with flooding tinther aggravating the situation; and (ii) weak social indicators (Table 6); + vev limitedgovernment saving, This is the product of a weak tax base and the burden of the conflict in the South, which continued to divert resources needed for priority social and development outlays. The latter factor was also hampering confidence in economic prospects and domestic as well as foreign private investment; * lack of external assistance and unsustainable external debt burden. This in part reflected strained political relations with many members of the international community; + weakfinancial andforeign exchange intermediation by commercial banks, resulting in high financial costs and constraining private sector savings and investment; + limited and thin foreign exchange market, that contributes to a weak external sector, including a narrow export base. + high tariff protection and complex foreign trade procedures. 23. Medium-term macroeconomic objectives. In the light of the above constraints, there was agreement that maintaining economic growth of about 5-5.5 percent would be a realistic target. The authorities believed that with the resumption of external support to rehabilitate the infrastructure and the lifting of U.S. economic and U.N. political sanctions, growth could possibly reach 7-8 percent, The program also aims to: reduce intIation to 5 percent in 2001; lower the external current account deficit (on a cash basis and excluding the oil trade and pipeline related imports) by over 2 percentage points of GDP; and raise the foreign exchange reserves of the BOS to three weeks of imports by 2001 (Table 7). The external adjustment is expected to provide for a limited increase in debt service payments with a view to making progress toward normalizing financial relations with some creditors and unlocking a minimum of technical and financial external assistance, with the objective of restoring the productive potential of the irrigated schemes in particular.

Economic growth over the medium-term is expected to be led by higher exports, including the coming on stream of oil exports. The projections envisage that economic growth will drop to around the recent trend of 5-5.5 percent during 2000-2001, as rainfed agricultural production reverts to more normal levels than in 1999. The drop in pipeline-related investment spending in 2000 is expected to be offset by the start of oil production and exports. Attainment of the growth objective will require higher public and non-oil sector investment, and an import level consistent with this. Central government development outlays are projected to rise by 2 percentage points of GDP, financed mostly by increased public savings. Private investment could decline initially in the year 2000, as the oil project is completed. However, in response to the structural reforms, non-oil investment is expected to rise by almost 2 percentage points of GDP over 1999-2001, financed by an increase in domestic savings, supplemented by private transfers; private savings will be favorably affected by lower oil import requirements (see paragraph 54) 25. Risks to the program. The authorities stressed that the main risks to achieving the program growth objectives lay in the poor state of the infrastructure, and the lack of external and domestic resources to address the problem. Moreover, even the limited public investment envisaged under the program was not assured because of downside risks in the revenue projections. The authorities were also concerned about political support for the program, especially if revenue. shortfalls again had to be offset by expenditure cuts, or in case of excessive exchange rate fluctuations, The mission recognized that Sudan was particularly prone to exogenous shocks and stressed that these could derail the program, if appropriate corrective measures were not taken promptly. It was also recognized that the lack of admini- strative capacity and technical assistance (outside the macroeconomic area) could cause delays in structural reforms. B. The 1999 Program 26. Macroeconomic objectives. The authorities underscored their commitment to adhere to the agreed fiscal and monetary policies, and to undertake corrective measures as needed to ensure the attainment of the program objectives (Box 3). The growth, inflation and budgetary targets of the 1999 program were left unchanged, while the monetary program was tightened somewhat in response to the breach of the net domestic credit ceiling at end- December 1998. Reflecting this revision, as well as the end-1998 outcome, adjustments were introduced to the quantitative benchmarks, and new benchmarks were established on payments to non-Fund creditors and development and social outlays. As anticipated, the end- March structural benchmarks were modified and others were identified for the remainder of 1999, consistent with the agreed medium-term structural reforms (Attachment I, Annex Q8 ‘Two structural benchmarks related to the VAT envisaged for end-March in the 1999 program in EBS/99/11, were postponed until later in the year as VAT preparations are continuing. The benchmark related to bank supervision was moved to end-June due to a delay in Fund technical assistance.

Objectives: Main objectives of the 1999 macroeconomic program are: . real GDP growth rate of 6 percent; . reduction of the annual inflation rate (end-of-period) to 10 percent; . external current account deficit (excluding interest due, public transfers and oil- exports and imports) of 4.1 percent of GDP; and . a build-up of gross usable international reserves by about US%20 million to US%45 million. !. Macro-policies: To attain these objectives the program targets (in percent of beginning money stock): . growth of broad money of 24 percent; . growth in net domestic assets of 9 percent of opening money stock; . growth of credit to the private sector in real terms by about 10 percent.; . reduction of the domestic financing requirement of the budget (by 0.1 percent of GDP to 0.4 percent of GDP). To attain this objective, a revenue effort of 0.9 percent of GDP is expected to be made; and . maintain policy of market-determination of exchange rate. 1. Structural policies: Key structural reforms are: . introduction of a value-added tax by end-1999; . strengthening of tax administration, including through the adoption of a unified tax payer identification number for large taxpayers; . reform the Investment Encouragement Act, with a view to limiting discretionary tax exemptions powers; . significantly improve fiscal reporting and bring budget classification up to GFS standards; . further improvement of the budget process, including though the preparation of a quarterly expenditure plan to be updated monthly; . introduction of the Government Musharaka Certificate in April 1999; . continued efforts to deepen the foreign exchange market, including by removing limit on banks’ retention of foreign exchange; and . strengthening of prudential supervision.

Real GDP is still projected to grow by 6 percent in 1999, although prospects for individual sectors have changed some- what.’ Stronger economic activity is expected in the livestock, rainfed agriculture and industrial sectors, and oil production will begin in the fourth quarter, which is expected to outweigh the more serious than anticipated flood impact on the output of cotton, sesame, and groundnuts. Given the tighter monetary policy envisaged for the remainder of the year, and expected seasonal patterns, year-on-year inflation is projected to decline from about mid- year. Both the average inflation target of 14 percent and the end-year target of 10 percent are therefore considered to be attainable. 28. External developments. The external current account deficit’(on a cash basis) is projected to narrow by 3.5 percentage points of GDP against a previously projected reduction of 2.1 percentage points of GDP.” Export growth is expected to be lower than anticipated--owing to lower volumes of cotton, sesame, and groundnuts-and to be more than offset by an 11 percent decline in imports, largely on account of lower import requirements for the construction of the oil-pipeline. The projection for private transfers has been revised upwards to reflect their strong performance in the last quarter of 1998. 29. Macroeconomic policies. The budgetary objectives remain: (i) to limit the overall deficit (on a cash basis ) to 1 .O percent of GDP whi!e reducing the domestically financed deficit to 0.4 percent of GDP; and (ii) to increase capital and social expenditure, including at least US%27 million for the rehabilitation of flood affected areas, to be financed from external sources.” As regards the tightening of the monetary program, net domestic credit is now projected to grow by 8.7 percent of beginning money stock instead of by 9.7 percent (Attachment I, Table 2). C. Macroeconomic and Structural Policies in 1999-2001 Macroeconomic stance 30. Progress in macroeconomic stabilixation. The authorities were encouraged by the recent stabilization gains despite the difficult external environment and the increased spending needs arising from the flooding. They felt that the tight demand management policies that were behind the generally favorable 1997-98 outcomes were winning more political and 9A discussion of why the economy is expected to grow by 6 percent despite the floods is given in EBS/99/11, para. 18. ‘%x&ding imports related to the oil pipeline and the oil trade, there will be no change in the current account deficit in 1999. “The revenue and expenditure projections are reviewed in detail in EBS/99/11 (pages 14-15).

Nevertheless, the authorities drew attention to the costs of keeping the fiscal position on track, in terms of unmet development and rehabilitation needs. 31. Need to continue inflation reduction. The mission recognized the difficult trade-off between further reducing inflation and rehabilitation and development spending in the short- run. ~However, with inflationary pressures still evident and international commodity prices beginning to rebound, the battle against inflation in Sudan was far l?om won. Moreover, in the past, it had been the financial indiscipline of the government and consequent inflation that had contributed the most to the erosion of development spending in real terms. Fiscal reforms 32. The fiscal strategy. Fiscal policy will aim at strengthening revenue mobilization with a view to attaining the targeted savings needed to raise public investment and social outlays, while further reducing domestic financing requirements. Medium-term projections envisage a virtual balance (on a cash basis), through additional revenue efforts and a continued policy of restraint of non-priority expenditure, supported by additional reforms in the areas of taxation, expenditure control, and the budgetary process. Total revenue is projected to increase over the program period by almost 3 percentage points of GDP, despite the revenue losses expected to arise from the implementation of the trade reform, estimated at 1.1 percent of GDP, with the bulk concentrated in the later two years. The increase in revenue includes over I percentage point of GDP per annum from the government’s share in oil revenue. Development and social outlays are projected to account for the bulk of the targeted increase in expenditure (about 3 percentage points of GDP). The authorities stated that additional increases in these outlays would be possible if a peace agreement was reached regarding the civil war in the South, which would enable a reduction in military expenditures, currently equivalent to one quarter of the Federal budget; the authorities stated that they were working to negotiate such an agreement. 33. Revenue reforms. Efforts to improve revenue administration will focus on widening the tax base through tax reform and reduction of exemptions (see below), and on efforts to improve revenue administration. A key reform will be the introduction of the VAT, now envisaged for January 1, 2000 at the latest. Despite the delays incurred so far, the authorities were confident that the new deadline would be respected. Emphasis is also being placed on strengthened customs and tax administration, starting in 1999 with measures that focus on establishing a unified taxpayer identification number for large taxpayers. These efforts will be followed by a reform of the direct tax system, where the authorities would like to gradually reduce tax rates, provided it is consistent with the medium-term revenue goals, 34. Fiscal transparency. The authorities stressed that budgetary management in Sudan is fidly accountable and that the budget process is very open. The mission responded that analytically more useful data are needed to monitor budgetary execution. As a first step to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - this end, the Federal Chamber of Accounts will prepare consolidated monthly accounts based on reports provided by line ministries, and reform budget classification to bring it up to GFS standards, which will improve the quality of reporting and fiscal transparency. The program envisages more ambitious measures over the medium-term, described in detail in Attachment I, paras. 23-24, to make progress toward the formulation of an appropriate medium-term expenditure and budget framework. 35. Federal-states fiscal relations. States play a crucial role in the Sudanese fiscal system as they are responsible for education (except for universities), health, and other social outlays. The authorities stated that Federal-states fiscal relations were currently being studied by a committee, including such issues as revenue sharing, given the need to find more effective means of mobilizing resources to finance the states. Reforms in this area are critically linked to the objectives of the government to: (i) achieve a marked improvement in social indicators; and (ii) protect the competitiveness of the traded goods sector, that is heavily taxed by the states. To assist the above-mentioned committee in preparing recommendations that must be agreed at cabinet level by end-1999, the authorities will request technical assistance from the Fund. In addition, to ensure the adequate use of transfers to the states for social purposes, the government is making such transfers conditional upon timely reports on spending. Monetary policy and reform 36. Monetary management. In the context of a’market-determined exchange rate, monetary policy will target a gradual further reduction in the rate of money growth to achieve the inflation and balance of payments objectives of the program. The projected reduction of BOS financing of the budget over the medium term should allow a substantial increase in credit to the private sector, thereby supporting the attainment of the growth objective. 37. Liquidity management. The authorities saw a need to tinther strengthen the central bank’s capacity in liquidity management to respond promptly and effectively to pressures on prices and the exchange rate. They were hopeful that with the forthcoming issuance of the GMCs and the strengthening of the legal reserve requirements, the central bank would be in a better position to manage liquidity. The mission broadly shared this assessment, but cautioned that the scope of the CMCs, as well as of the GMCs, would remain limited in this initial phase, and that the central bank may even need to resort to the traditional instruments to control liquidity. The mission underscored the need to monitor the deposits of public entities, as their unanticipated movements may have had some destabilizing impact in late 1998 and early 1999, though this impact was difficult to disentangle from seasonal pressures. 38. Completing the development of indirect financial instruments. Efforts will be geared toward coordinating the price discount policy of the on-demand buy backs of the CMCs with the timing and size of buyback auctions. In addition, open market operations are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - to be initiated with the GMCs in the second half of the year, supported by the conversion of the current central bank standing financing facility into three clearly differentiated lending facilities (overdraft, lender of last resort, general financing). This will make available a reference cost of financing, as one of the instruments will be auction based. The feasibility and timing of the introduction of these rather complex overdraft facilities will be the subject of the first review of the program. To reduce the cost of financial intermediation over the program period, a lowering of the overall reserve requirement through a gradual convergence of the domestic and foreign currency reserve requirement is envisaged. The authorities expressed caution with regard to reducing reserve requirements, noting that they would need to be sure that overall liquidity conditions were consistent with continuing progress in reducing inflation. 39. Bank supervision to be strengthened. The authorities underscored the critical need for strengthened bank supervision and have already taken steps to monitor capital adequacy, provisioning, and lending concentration. This has already revealed weaknesses as regards capital adequacy. However, they drew attention to the limited qualified human resources available for bank supervision. Measures to strengthen supervision will include: (i) a thorough review with Fund technical assistance, in the second quarter, of the status of compliance with key prudential regulations with a view to assessing technical assistance needs in bank super-vision and develop an action plan for 1999; (ii) an agreement by the BOS and commercial banks by June 1999 on steps to reduce the size of nonperforming loans and ensure that provisioning is adequate; (iii) full introduction of a transparent new bank accounting system by September 1999; (iv) a shift in the emphasis from audit-like on-site inspections to the evaluation of bank soundness; and (v) increased training. Reform of the exchange system 40. Exchange rate policy. The authorities stressed that the exchange rate will continue to be determined in the market. They regretted that the absence of an appropriate level of international reserves prevented intervention in the market to smooth out abrupt fluctuations in the exchange rate. BOS intervention in 1999 would therefore be very limited, consistent with the overall target of increasing foreign exchange reserves by US%20 million. While the authorities were worried that a sharp depreciation would undermine support for the program, the staff stressed that some real depreciation was probably unavoidable in 1999 in view of the prevailing adverse external environment, In fact, the real effective depreciation in 1998 had had a favorable impact, as demonstrated by the strong response of export volume and private transfers, while tight demand management policies had contained inflation to the targeted levels. 41. Functioning of the exchange market. The need for measures to deepen the exchange market and encourage bank intermediation was underlined by the mission, including the relaxation of the foreign exchange retention limits on banks and exporters and the elimination of the surrender requirement on services. The authorities regretted that most Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-30. commercial banks were not undertaking active intermediation in the foreign exchange market, and to address this problem will introduce by end-June measures to improve the functioning of the market: (i) the removal of the 2-day lit on how long banks can keep purchased foreign exchange; and (ii) the elimination of the surrender requirements that remain on cotton and gum arabic. The authorities also reiterated their commitment to assess the possibility of using the daily average rate as the official rate at the time of the first review. In the meantime, the BOS will begin to calculate and report to the Fund the daily average rate. 42. Exchange restrictions. Sudan maintains one inoperative bilateral payments agreement with a Fund member subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 The staff encouraged the authorities to eliminate this restriction. The authorities indicated that all of Sudan’s external payments arrears arise from government or publicly guaranteed debt of entities that are part of the budgetary process. Thus, they do not give rise to exchange restrictions. 43. Ambitious trade reforms envisaged. A reduction in Sudan’s trade restrictiveness index from 7 currently to 2 over a three-year period will be achieved through the trade reforms envisaged under the program. This involves tariff reduction, starting with the budget for the year 2000, and the elimination of the feti remaining nontariff barriers. A key element of the tariff reform is the targeted reduction in the average customs tariff from 25 percent currently to under 15 percent in the 2002 budget, by lowering the maximum tariff rate from the current 80 percent to 30 percent and the number of tariff bands from 5 currently to 3 over the same period (Attachment I, Annex II). The authorities recognize that this reform implies the urgent need to ensure a durable strengthening of the revenue base. 44. All nontariff barriers to be removed. The authorities stated that the few remaining non-tariff trade barriers were now largely ineffective, but agreed that their removal would give a positive signal regarding commitment to trade reform and would make the trade regime more transparent, The program envisages the elimination of (i) the stamping requirement by the Ministry of Commerce prior to export or import; and (ii) the export ban on raw skins and hides. Export taxes orrcotton will also be eliminated, while leaving the export taxes on gum arabic unchanged pending a review of the taxation of the sector. Structural reforms outside the macroeconomic area 45. Improving the regulatory framework. The key issue is the review and amendment of the Investment Encouragement Act, anticipated to take place by the end of the year. The objectives of the reform are,to eliminate the proliferation of tax and tariff exemptions granted by different line ministries which have contributed to an erosion of the tax base and lack of transparency. The authorities stressed their keenness to move as far as possible in this Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- direction, but said they would face fierce resistance from various interest groups. In particular the authorities will endeavor to eliminate customs exemptions on imported intermediate goods or to subject them to a maximum three-year time limit. The reform will also centralize the granting of the exemptions regarding federal taxes, eliminate the renewal of expiring exemptions, and simplify the investment application process through the introduction of one-stop procedures, which should facilitate private sector investment. Reforms pertaining to the labor market and the judicial system will be pursued once technical assistance is secured. 46. Constraints to public enterprise reform. The authorities underscored their commitment to privatization and their willingness to privatize all public enterprises, including large ones such as the airline company. They said that the thinness of the capital market and the lack of resources for separation payments are the main constraints to privatization, although they were finding solutions. Some 60 smaller enterprises had been privatized, or turned into joint ventures, in the first phase of the privatization program (1993-97). More- over, shares of the telecommunications company had been sold to the public, and several important roads and power plants had been turned over the private sector to operate. 47. Further privatization. Given the constraints, the focus of the medium-term staff- monitored program (MTSMP) would be on smaller units (Attachment I, Annex III), although if there is investor interest the partial or outright sale of the larger companies would be considered. The authorities would also like to privatize publicly-owned banks, but valuation will be difficult, while the authorities share in the joint venture banks is quite small.” Efforts would also focus on strengthening the performance of several enterprises, mainly in utilities and transportation, to reduce production costs and provide the needed support to the private sector. In particular, the restructuring of the National Electric Corporation is proceeding in line with expectations: increases in tariffs are gradually reflecting costs with a~view to &lly eliminating subsidies’by end-2000; tariff collection has improved markedly; and the private sector is being encouraged to invest in the generation and distribution of electricity. 48. Difficulties in irrigated sector. Agriculture is the growth engine of the Sudanese economy and the strong response of the livestock and rainfed sectors, as well as fruit and vegetable production, to liberalization and improved incentives was seen as very encouraging. However, the authorities stressed that the very difficult situation in the irrigated schemes posed complex problems in terms of the operation of the joint infrastructure. The lack of maintenance, especially of irrigation canals, and organizational problems had resulted in a contraction in the area under cultivation and output. In addition, with the BOS no longer financing these schemes, credit had become scarce, as the commercial banks were not capable and/or willing to provide adequate resources. ‘*The eventual privatization of banks may result in the contraction of the CMC fund Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - 49. Agricultural reform. Reform ofthe irrigated sector will be a priority. Efforts will be made at identifying a solution to the organizational and financing problems facing the Gezira scheme, by far the largest, as a basis for extending the reform to the rest of the sector. To this end, the scheme has been decentralized and numerous units providing supplementary services (canal maintenance, storage, etc.) have been opened to private sector participation. The government’s intention is to retain ownership of the land and the main canals and pumps, but the role of the public Sudan Gezira Board, which operates the infrastructure, remains to be clarified. The authorities intend to formulate a plan to address this issue by end-1999 and will request technical assistance from the World Bank. Emphasis will also be placed on limiting in practice the tax burden on agriculture to 20 percent of the value of output in the rainfed sector and 15 percent in the irrigated sector, as agreed with the states. 50. Social issues. The authorities said that their social policies aim at improving Sudan’s very weak social indicators, with particular emphasis on achieving universal basic education and providing primary health access to the entire population. However, the attainment of these objectives is constrained by the lack of adequate resources and a database. As noted above, the provision of basic health and primary education services is the responsibility of state and local governments, while poverty alleviation is handled largely by the Zakat Fund and NGOs. The central govermnent budget supports specialized medical care and higher education, and provides transfers in support of the state and local social programs. However, the value of basic health and education services cannot be quantified at present because of lack of data. There are indications, however, of a weakening revenue capacity of some states and local councils. At the same time, the recent floods have increased the incidence of many diseases and the medical rehabilitation needs of the country. Accordingly, the program calls for an increase in budgetary support for social development and poverty alleviation; the protection of the current level of transfers from the burden of adjustment through the above- mentioned floors and associated conditionalities imposed by the Federal government; and the develop-ment of information systems and appropriate indicators to monitor the status of primary health care and education. (Both of these issues will need to be addressed with the assistance of the World Bank). Emphasis is also placed on the preparation of a survey for basic data as a basis for identifying the needs of families below the poverty line. D. Other Issues Data issues 51. Improvement in macroeconomic database. In 1997-98, Sudan continued to make improvements in its macroeconomic database in terms of timeliness and coverage (Appendix III), and the reported data were adequate for program monitoring. The remaining deficiencies reflect the limited resources available for gathering basic information and poor communications within the country. There is still a need for additional progress, particularly in the areas of monetary and balance of payments statistics on which technical assistance from the Fund will be provided in April/May. Also, increased efforts to gather timely fiscal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33 - and social data from states will be required to provide the basis for formulating well-targeted social programs, as noted above. Finally, the authorities need to improve and make more timely data on the national accounts, especially on the expenditure side. Relations with creditors 52. Payments to creditors. The authorities reiterated their commitment to pay US%40 million to the Fund and US$30 million to other creditors in 1999. They also stressed that they would return to payments of at least US$60 million to the Fund in 2000, and if balance of payments developments allowed, would increase their payments to the Fund and other creditors in the future. The authorities said that they had already reached agreements on payments to the Saudi Fund and the African Development Bank, and had begun discussions with the OPEC Fund and several other regional institutions. Discussions with the World Bank were expected to begin at the time of the Interim Committee meeting in late April; the authorities stressed they placed priority on resuming payments to, and starting to receive technical assistance from, the World Bank. The authorities reiterated that if payments to creditors other than the Fund did not reach US%30 million in 1999, the residual amount would be paid to the Fund. 53. Payments discipline essential. The staff welcomed that Sudan was continuing to make timely payments to the Fund and stressed the importance of reaching agreements on a resumption of payments to other creditors as soon as possible. Adherence to the new payments schedule is essential for restoring credibility with these creditors. V. MEDIUM-TERM EXTERNAL OUTLOOK 54. Current account deficit to be reduced, but remains unsustainable.. Full adherence to the envisaged policies and reforms, and the coming on stream of oil production will contribute to a reduction in the external current account deficit (on a cash basis) (Appendix IV). Total exports are projected to increase by an average of 26 percent during 1999-2001 reflecting: (i) continued strong export volume growth (nearly 8 percent) in response to structural reforms and a moderate improvement in world market prices; and (ii) the emergence of oil exports (about 90,000 barrels per day), averaging about US%350 million per year during 2000-2002, out of a total value of exports of US%]. 1 billion. Total imports are projected to decline by about 8 percent during 1999-2001, reflecting lower import needs: (i) of oil products (US%250 million in 1999) as Sudan attains self-sufficiency in the year 2000; and (ii) by the oil pipeline project, following its completion in 1999. Excluding imports of oil products and those related to the oil-pipeline, imports are projected to grow by an average of 8 percent. The income account will see a gradual deterioration, mirroring the increase in oil exports, as profits generated by the pipeline and other costs (mainly trans- portation) are transferred to nonresident partners. Private transfers are expected to grow moderately. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - 55. At end-1999 Sudan’s stock of external debt is projected at US%23.5 billion, equivalent to over 250 percent of GDP, while the debt service ratio (on an accrual basis) is projected at 228 percent in 1999. Given this level of indebtedness, even a sensitivity analysis assuming, separately, a more rapid growth of exports and a Paris Club rescheduling on Naples terms would not have a significant impact on Sudan’s unsustainable debt burden (Appendix IV, Table 3). VI. STAFFAPPRAISAL. 56. Sudan has taken important steps in recent years to begin reversing two decades of economic decline. The private sector has been allowed to play a more active role, and major distortions have been removed through price and exchange market liberalization, and the elimination of subsidies. In 1997-98, the liberalization measures were reinforced by tighter demand management, which resulted in a sharp reduction in inflation and facilitated the unification of the exchange market, The economy has responded to the reforms by expanding at an average of about 5 percent per annum in recent years. 57. On the structural side, the foundations for improved macroeconomic management have been laid. Revenue elasticity should be enhanced by the recent tariff and excise reform, and VAT preparations have made substantial progress. The budget process has been incorporated into a broader macroeconomic framework. Central bank and government debt instruments compatible with Islamic principles have, or are about to be, introduced. 58. Despite these promising initial steps, Sudan faces formidable obstacles to achieving sustainable economic growth and external viability. The infrastructure has suffered from years of underinvestment which ultimately reflects federal government revenues of only 8 percent of GDP. Also, the internal conflict is diverting budgetary resources away from productive use. Poor political relations with some countries and an unsustainable external debt burden have limited access to external resources and undermined private sector confidence. Other major constraints to development are the limited intermediation capacity of the financial system, a largely inefficient public enterprise sector, and excessive trade protection. 59. The broad objectives of the economic program for 1999-2001 are to consolidate the progress towards macroeconomic stabilization and create conditions for a sustained increase in investment and savings. Nevertheless, the macroeconomic targets are quite modest, with growth staying at current rates of 5-5.5 percent and only limited progress toward external viability expected. The latter reflects the status of relations with creditors, which prevents tidl debt regularization, including a Paris Club rescheduling. Still, the program targets a gradual improvement in the external position to enable a moderate build-up of external reserves and increased debt service payments, The latter will allow for the normalization of relations with some creditors and a resumption of assistance. But most importantly, the program will help Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-35- to prepare the economy for the time when more support from creditors would be forth- coming, and the conversion of the MTSMF’ into a ItAP could be considered. This will only be achieved if the macroeconomic and structural measures are implemented fully and on time 60. In the macroeconomic area, tight demand management policies need to be maintained in order to ensure that lower inflationary expectations and a more stable exchange market take firm hold. This will require continued reduction in domestic government financing, and the maintenance of a tight monetary policy. To improve monetary control, the authorities need to develop as soon as possible their capacity to conduct monetary policy effectively with the new central bank and government debt instruments. While the authorities have been responding promptly through tighter demand management whenever the program has threatened to go off-track, careful management of bank liquidity, including the monitoring the movements of public entities’ deposits at the BOS, could prevent such pressures. Further reductions in the indicative rates for Murabaha should only be undertaken in periods when demand pressures are absent. The recent rise in inflation, although possibly temporary, is of concern and early corrective measures will be needed if the pressures do not abate. 61. The current exchange rate policy, which resulted in a significant depreciation of the real effective exchange rate in 1998, has served the country well, contributing to strong growth in export volume and private transfers. In view of Sudan’s limited exchange reserves and monetary policy capacity, the exchange rate should continue to be market-determined and to absorb the initial impact of exogenous shocks and shii%s in money demand. 62. The medium-term fiscal strategy entails an increase in investment in social and physical infrastmcture, while further reducing domestic financing. The onset of oil revenues will help in this regard, but a substantial improvement in tax administration is also needed. The VAT and the reduction of exemptions under the Investment Encouragement Act are especially import-ant in this regard, and should be implemented as soon as possible. Sudan has a reasonably well-structured and open budget process, and the measures envisaged under the program will help to liuther enhance transparency considerably. 63: An ambitious opening of the economy is envisaged by the end of the program period, with Sudan’s trade regime moving from being restrictive to open on the basis of the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness. Tariffs will be reduced substantially, and the few remaining non-tariff trade barriers will be removed. The removal of formal obstacles to commercial bank intermediation, and of remaining surrender requirements, will also help improve the lunctioning of the market. 64. To develop a sound banking system, bank supervision will need to be strengthened. The BOS needs to work closely with the forthcoming Fund technical assistance mission to evaluate the soundness of the bank system, and to identify corrective measures. As a priority, the BOS needs to agree with commercial banks on measures to reduce non-performing loans and ensure adequate provisioning against bad loans.

The strong response of the private sector to the reforms, despite Sudan’s difficult circumstances, is encouraging. The authorities should maintain and expand current initiatives to allow and encourage private sector participation in all sectors, including the infrastructure. They should also persevere with privatization efforts, although the thin capital market and the lack of resources for separation payments are legitimate constraints. While it will be difficult to fblly rehabilitate the irrigation schemes without external financial assistance, the authorities should seek market based solutions to the operation of the joint infrastructure. 66. After years of economic decline, internal conflict, and numerous natural catastrophes, there is widespread poverty in Sudan and many social indicators are weak. The objectives of the government in the health and education areas are appropriate but realiition is con- strained by the weak financial position of many states, and the absence of timely data. The decision to increase and give priority to transfers to states related to social spending in case of expenditure cutbacks, as well as to introduce conditionality on these transfers, is welcome. The staff would encourage donors to.consider providing technical assistance to Sudan as regards the effective provision of social services and improving the social data base, in view of the potentially high returns in terms of reducing poverty. 67. There has been an improvement in Sudan’s macroeconomic statistics in the past two years, but important deficiencies remain, Most importantly, more analytically usetbl data (m .hne with the GFS classification) on budgetary execution are needed to improve fiscal transparency. The staff encourages the authorities to implement the recommendations of upcoming monetary and balance of payments technical assistance missions, and to step-up efforts to collect timely fiscal and social data Tom states. 68. In sum, the staffbelieves that the medium-term program is appropriate and realistically ambitious. However, there are significant risks to achieving the program objectives. First, the economy is highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including terms of trade shifts. Second, after tight expenditure policies in 1997-98, there are calls for a more expansionary policies, and further spending cuts in response to a revenue shortfall may not be feasible. Third, the foreign exchange market is still thin and relatively small transactions can cause wide fluctua-tions in the exchange rate that could trigger political pressures to abandon the current regime. On the structural side, little technical assistance is available outside the macroeconomic area, which will complicate implementation of the program. 69. The staff welcomes Sudan’s full adherence to the schedule of payments to the Fund in 1997-98, and urges the authorities to maintain this performance in 1999 and beyond. The staff would encourage the authorities to reach agreements with willing creditors as soon as possible, especially the World Bank, consistent with their commitment of making payments of US%30 million to non-Fund creditors in 1999.

With the unification of the exchange market in October 1998, the only restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII arises from the outstanding balance under an inoperative bilateral payments agreement with Egypt. In the absence of a definite timetable for the settlement of the outstanding balance under this agreement, the statf does not recommend approval of this restriction. 71. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Sudan take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange and Trade Arrangement Beginning in July 1996, the daily exchange rate for commercial banks and nonbank authorized dealers was set by a Joint Committee of commercial banks and nonbank dealers. In deciding this rate, the Committee took into account the transactions-weighted rate of the previous day, as well as demand and supply factors in the exchange market. Market participants set their own buying rate within a range of 50.3 percent from the reference rate set by the Committee. On February 27, 1997, the Committee was expanded by including a representative from the Bank of Sudan and the trading band was widened from 50.3’percent to i2.0 percent. On March 24, the spread between the free “accounts-to-accounts” market and official dealer exchange rates was lowered to 16 percent (from about 20 percent), implying a depreciation of about 3 percent of the latter rate. Since then, the exchange rate set by the Committee has been adjusted downward progressively, and by end-September 1998, the spread between the market and official exchange rates was limited to about 1-2 percent. From October 21, the BOS exchange rate has been set as the I4-day moving average market exchange rates, and this was reduced to 10 days at end-December 1998 and 5 days at end-March 1999; the BOS has undertaken not to let the divergence between the official rate and the average market rate exceed 2 percent, The BOS applies its moving average rate to the foreign exchange receipts for the remaining surrender requirements (collected through banks) and to the foreign exchange that banks have to surrender to BOS after, the expiration of the 10 days limit on holdings by exporters of repatriated export receipts. BOS conducts all other transactions at negotiated rates, Foreign exchange transactions between exporters and importers are all carried out at negotiated exchange rates. Very few transactions take place among banks (all at negotiated rates) and no bank has assumed a market maker role yet. VIII. Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation discussions were held during November 25-December 5, 1997 and January 6-17, 1998. The StaffReport (EBS/98/22, 2/13/98) was discussed by the Executive Board on February 27, 1998. Ix. Technical Assistance Since the Executive Board approval in January 1995, to resume Fund selective technical assistance to Sudan, there have been the following technical assistance missions: (i) tariff reforms and sales tax (August 1995, March 1997, May 1997, October 1997, May, October, and November 1998); (ii) multisector technical assistance in statistics (September/October 1995); (iii) exchange system reform (April 1997, November 1997, May and September 1998); (iv) monetary management and banking supervision (June 1997, November 1997, May, September, and December 1998); (v) government finance statistics (June 1997 and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - APPENDIX I May 1998); (vi) monetary statistics (July 1997); and (vii) expenditure control (September 1997) and management (May 1998).

The World Bank does not have an active portfolio with Sudan at present. Disburse- ments were suspended in April 1993, and Sudan’s arrears were placed on non-accrual status in January 1994. Sudan’s outstanding IBRD and IDA debt, including arrears, is some US$1,205 million; total accumulated IBRD and IDA arrears amounted to US%135 million at end-March 1999. Under current Bank policies, no lending is possible, pending full settlement of the arrears. The authorities are well aware of Bank policy on countries with protracted arrears, which requires payments arrangements to be comparable to those of the IMF. Pending the resolution of the arrears problem, the Government of Sudan (GOS) has expressed its eagerness for a resumption of Bank non-lending support. The GGS has indicated that it attaches high priority to normalizing its financial relations with the Bank. Currently, discussions on the normaliiation of financial relations are planned during the Interim Committee meetings in late April 1999. 2. The GOS is anxious to improve its credibility in the international community, and it feels that an enlarged Bank presence could contribute towards achieving this objective. The Bank has been responsive to the GGS on non-lending services. A Bank staff team led the preparation of the recent multi-agency Floods Assessment, which was coordinated by the UNDP. Bank staff has been working with the Sudanese authorities on the issue of water resource sharing and management involving countries along the Nile river. In other areas, Bank staffparticipated in various symposia convened by the UNDP to explore post-conflict development issues. In addition, in the context of current Bank policy on countries in conflict, the Bank is monitoring political, social and economic events as they unfold. Bank staff participated in the recent IMF medium-term program mission to assess the willingness of the GGS in normalizing relations with the Bank, and to discuss feedback on areas for possible Bank non-lending technical assistance (TA), emphasizing agriculture and the social sectors, and also privatization. 3. While the scope of Bank TA support for the GGS remains to be agreed, Bank staff has been working with the authorities to identify potential areas for such TA. Agriculture and the social sectors are the priorities for possible Bank support, in view of the potential impact of these areas on broad-based growth in household incomes, access to social services and poverty reduction, Major issues of concern in agriculture include supporting: (i) effective marketing of agricultural export crops; and (ii) government initiative to restructure the organization and management of common irrigation infrastructure. Specific areas of work include redefining the role of government in large-scale irrigation asset management, decentralization and divestiture of appropriately selected irrigation support services; financing, maintenance and rehabilitation of irrigation assets; reform of water tariffs and improved accountability for the use of water revenues; and capacity development needs for improving irrigation maintenance and management Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - APPENDIX II 4. Considering the impact of the conflict on social conditions and poverty, the identification of potential Bank TA in the social sectors was centered on assessing the status of poverty and social development to deepen understanding and enhance readiness for post- conflict activities, focusing on drinking water, education and health. The social sector work is expected to cover both the North and the South. Issues include: social expenditure patterns and policies; household coping strategies in the conflict; status and profile of displaced persons; vulnerable groups (especially women and children) and the state of local institutions and social networks. The authorities have stressed the need for a Bank TA to support the ongoing privatization program, though the Bank does not view this as a priority area at the moment. Overall, the scope of Bank non-lending TA would depend on the commitment of the GOS to normalizing relations with the Bank and on continued compliance with the IIvIP program.

Outstanding statistical issues Real Sector In spite of improvements in recent years, deficiencies persist in the statistical systems, and statistical agencies tknction with severe resource constraints. These systems suffer from problems of both data quality and timeliness. The following assesses the status in each statistical area. In the area of national accounts, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) prepares annual estimates at current and constant 1981/82 prices, with a time lag of about two years for GDP by industrial origin and more than three years for GDP by expenditure components. The timeliness of the data appears to have improved recently as some of the 1997 national accounts data are now available. Available basic data are often insufficient in quantity and/or quality; and a variety of statistical techniques, rather than surveys, are necessarily employed to derive the estimates. The private final consumption expenditures, three fourths of GDP, are derived residually. The pending Census of Agriculture and the Household Income and Expenditure Surveys are urgently needed, as are additional surveys for some industries; it is hoped that the former will be conducted this year. There is a need to review the process of compiling the national account data and identify areas that need tinther improvement. With respect to price indices, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the only comprehensive price indicator in Sudan, although some WPI data have begun to be published, the CPI indices are prepared monthly for three income groups and for fifteen cities in twelve regions; the only longer series are for the Greater Khartoum area (January 1988-October 1997). The indices appear conceptually sound and competently managed, but the underlying weighting scheme is obsolete. Submission of real sector data to STA is irregular, and data on consumer price index and values of exports and imports only are published in the IFS. Government Finance Government finance statistics continue to be deficient as regards to data on states budgets. Although the authorities started in 1997 preparing a consolidated budget statement, including central, state and local budgets, this reflects only the planned but not the executed budgets. A program to enable the preparation of government finance statistics that would follow the Fund’s publication, A Manual on Government Finance Statistics was initiated following recommendations of the June 1997 STA mission on government finance statistics, but progress has been limited.

Remaining issues in this area relate to ensuring comprehensive coverage of the banking sector, improving the classification of accounts, and enhancing the timeliness of data compilation and repotting. In addition, there is a need to review the accounts “other items, net,” and “valuation adjustment” in the monetary survey and BOS accounts, as anomalies have been observed in 1998. Balance of Payments Balance of payments statistics suffer primarily from inadequate coverage. Most of the recommendations of the 1995 STA mission have been being implemented, including the introduction of revised report forms for the commercial banks, changes in the data collection procedure for the international transactions of the Bank of Sudan, and ensuring the classification of all international transactions of the commercial banks according to balance of payments principles, particularly the adoption of the residency criterion. The authorities are continuing to work on alternate procedures for the estimation of workers remittances and the initiation of questionnaires to collect supplementary data from nonbank sources. However, the compilation of financial account transactions, especially with regard to foreign direct investment, remains weak. 2.

This appendix updates last year’s analysis of Sudan’s external debt and its sustain- ability over the long-term.’ The conclusion’s of the previous analysis remain unchanged, namely, that Sudan’s external debt is unsustainable, even with significantly more rapid export growth, and a Paris Club rescheduling on Naples terms. World Bank staff is in agreement with the results of the debt sustainability analysis. 2. At end-1998 the face value of Sudan’s outstanding public and publicly guaranteed stock of external debt amounted to USS22.4 billion (of which U&$19.3 billion was in arrears), equivalent to 253 percent of GDP (Table 1). In net present value (NPV) terms, the stock of debt was estimated at US.321 billion (equivalent to 3,3 10 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services).’ About 19.4 percent of Sudan’s nominal external debt was owed to multilateral institutions, 57.3 percent was owed to bilateral creditors (of which 27.5 percent to Paris Club creditors and about 30 percent to non-Paris Club bilateral creditors), and the rest, about 23.4 percent, was owed to commercial creditors. In 1998, scheduled debt service payments were estimated at 224 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services, although, actual payments amounted to only 11 percent (Tables 2 and 3). A. Long-term Balance of Payments Projections and Debt Analysis 3. The long-term balance of payments projection covering the period 1999-2020 assumes that Sudan will continue to implement appropriately tight fiscal and monetary policies, and will strengthen structural reforms, including the proposed trade liberalization and the maintenance of a unified free foreign exchange market. These policies should serve to strengthen Sudan’s external competitiveness, and boost export performance over the medium- long-term. The main assumptions underlying the long-term balance of payments are: ‘See EBS/98/22. The main difference between the current exercise and the previous one is that the revision of exports and imports in 1998 and 1999 results in lower than expected export earnings and larger than expected import bills over the medium termand therefore a wider external current account deficit. In addition, the discount factor used to calculate the net present value of debt is lower in line with the decline in interest rates over the past year. The growth of real GDP has also been revised downward from an average of about 6.5 percent over the medium-term to about 5.5 percent over the same period to reflect lower projected savings and investments. *An average discount factor of 6 percent (compared to 7 percent previously), which broadly corresponds to the currency specific CIRRs weighted by the currency composition of Sudan’s external debt, was used to calculate the net present value of debt. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 47 - APPENDIX IV . Average real GDP growth of 5.5 percent a year . Annual average non-oil export volume growth of about 6.5 percent, with export prices moving in line with World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections. . Annual import volume growth (excluding oil-pipeline imports and other oil imports ) of about 5.5 percent, broadly in line with growth in real GDP. . The oil-pipeline with a capacity of 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) is assumed to be completed toward end-1999 and becomes operational at the start of 2000. Production of oil is estimated at 150,000 bpd in 2000-2002. Production is assumed to increase by about 10 percent in 2003-2005 before tapering off to 5 percent in 2008, and thereafter. . Domestic consumption, which is estimated at roughly 50,000 bpd in 2000, is assumed to be fully met from domestic production. As a result, imports of petroleum products are assumed to decline to zero in 2000. Based on these assumptions, exports in 2000 are estimated at about 90,000 bpd, and are subsequently assumed to remain in the range of 90,00~100,000 bpd.” The projected international oil prices (tit) arc based on the latest estimates for the WEO. . Terms of trade are assumed to remain broadly unchanged over the projection period. ‘This estimate assumes that cost oil, which is the percentage of revenue transferred directly to foreign enterprises to cover their investment costs, would be about 50 percent of oil production revenue, to enable full cost recovery of the oil pipeline (US% 1.2 billion) within five years. Of the remaining 50 percent after cost oil, 60 percent would be transferred to the government, and the reminder to the participating enterprises as profit oil. On this basis, the government’s total share in oil revenue is estimated at 38 percent of total revenues from oil production during the first three years (2000-2003). As the transfers for cost-oil wind-down, the government’s share is estimated to rise to 52 percent in 2004 and to 60 percent thereafter. Thus, in U.S. dollar terms, the government’s share of oil revenues is estimated at between US$140-180 million a year in 2000-2003, before rising to US$275 million in 2004 and to over USS350 million in 2005 and beyond.

Project disbursements (both grants and loans), mainly from multilateral institutions, are assumed to grow in line with GDP.’ No assumptions were made regarding A4F and World Bank financial assistance, Paris and non-Paris Club rescheduling, nor any arrears clearance or refinancing operation. . Cumulative gross international reserves are targeted to rise gradually to the equivalent of 12 weeks of imports by 2007. 4. Under this baseline scenario, Sudan’s external current account deficit (on an accrual basis) would decline from about 19 percent of GDP in 1999 to an annual average of about 12 percent of GDP in 2015-2020; excluding scheduled interest obligations, the external current account deficit would narrow from about 6 percent of GDP in 1999, to an annual average of about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2015-2020 (Table 4). Given the probable absence of significant new financing from bilateral sources, Sudan would continue to finance the large current account deficits (on an accrual basis) through finther accumulation of external payments arrears and, to a lesser extent, unrecorded workers remittances. 5. The stock of external debt (including arrears) is projected to more than triple, from an estimated US$23.5 billion at end-1999, to about US$70.5 billion (of which over 95 percent would be arrears) by end-2020, mainly reflecting the capitalization of late interest obligations. In terms of GDP, the nominal stock of debt would decline from 250 percent in 1999 to about 170 percent in 2020, while the net present value of debt (in relation to exports of goods and non-factor services receipts) would decline from 3,602 percent in 1999 to 1,850 percent in 2020. Scheduled debt service obligations in relation to exports of goods and non-factor services are projected to decline from 228 percent in 1999, to slightly over I.05 percent in 2020. B. Sensitivity Analysis 6. In view of Sudan’s already severe external indebtedness, the sensitivity analysis looks at two possible developments and assesses their impact on Sudan’s’s debt sustainability: (i) beginning 2000, non-oil exports are assumed to exceed the baseline scenario by 20 percent-this only for illustrative purposes; and (ii) a hypothetical flow rescheduling of Sudan’s debt on Naples terms beginning 2000, followed by a stock-of-debt operation on It was assumed that Sudan’s payments to the Fund in relation to exports of goods and non- factor services, would remain roughly unchanged compared to 1997-99. In addition, the projection assumes that payments to other institutions, including the Islamic Development Bank, African Development Fund/Bank, OPEC Fund, the Saudi Fund, and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), would trigger new medium- and long-term financing during the projection period. All new financing after 1998 is assumed to be on concessional terms, with a grant element of at least 35 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 49 - APPENDIX IV Naples terms in 2003 (Table 3).5 In analyzing the sensitivity of the baseline scenario to the change in key assumptions, it is assumed that growth of real GDP and the target level of international reserves (in weeks of imports) remain as in the baseline projection. The results of the sensitivity analysis, suggest that even with a significant pick-up in exports or debt relief on Naples-terms, Sudan’s debt would continue to be unsustainable for some time. Under the first scenario of higher exports, the debt service ratio would decline from about 230 percent in 1999 to 120 percent in 2000, and to about 90 percent by 2020 (well above the 20 percent threshold). Similarly, the NPV-of-debt to exports ratio would decline from 3,600 percent in 1999 to about 2,900 percent in 2000, and decline gradually thereafter to reach 1,575 percent by 2020. 7. Although the impact of the rescheduling assumption on the key debt ratios is more pronounced than the above scenario, the debt burden would continue to remain substantial for a long time. Specifically, the debt service ratio after falling from 230 percent in 1999 to 58 percent in 2000 declines steadily to about 18.5 percent in 2020, while the NPV-of-debt ratio would first decline t%om 3,600 percent in 1999 to 1,500 percent in 2000, and to 210 percent by 2020. Thus, under this scenario, Sudan’s debt would remain unsustainable until 2020. The significantly larger impact of the rescheduling assumption reflects in part the fact that given most of Sudan’s debt is in arrears, even a flow rescheduling, if arrears are rescheduled, would be roughly equivalent to a stock of debt operation up-front. ‘The assumptions underlying the rescheduling scenario are as follows; regarding outstanding arrears as at end-1999, it is assumed that those owed to multilateral institutions (excluding the Fund) are replaced on concessional IDA-terms, while arrears to the Fund are assumed to be cleared after a period of three-year following a Fund-supported program; arrears on post- cutoff date debt owed to Paris Club creditors is assumed to be re-profiled at market interest rates and with a maturity of 15 years and 9 years of grace; all arrears on pre-cutoff date debt to Paris Club creditors are assumed to be rescheduled onNaples terms, and those owed to non-Paris Club bilateral, and commercial creditors would be treated on a comparable basis. Regarding the flow rescheduling, debt service obligations falling due to multilaterals and on post-cutoff date debt owed to Paris Club creditors are assumed to be paid as scheduled. All other debt service falling due (non-Paris club bilaterals, and commercial creditors) is assumed to be continuously rescheduled on Naples terms. The same treatment and coverage is assumed for the Naples terms stock-of debt operation in 2003. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicTable 1.

We would like to inform you that discussions with Fund staff on the 1999 Article IV consultation have been completed, and that we have agreed on a program of adjustment and structural reform for 1999-2001 that could be monitored by your staff. This program, as well as performance under the 1998 staff monitored program (SMP), is presented in the attached memorandum. 2. The medium-term program for 1999-2001 builds on the progress made in 1997 and 1998 in macroeconomic, stabilization and in implementing structural reforms in the monetary, fiscal, and external sector areas. Intlation was brought down from over 120 percent in 1996 to below 10 percent at end-1998, and economic growth has been maintained at an average rate of over 5 percent per annum, despite very difficult external circumstances. In particular, Sudan has been affected by: (i) continuing U.S. trade and U.N. political sanctions, which have undermined the confidence of private investors; (ii) declining export prices; (iii) a net outflow of resources to international financial institutions which has contributed to the shortages of foreign exchange, and constrained investment in infrastructure; and (iv) torrential rains and floods in August and September 1998 that caused extensive damage to productive capacity in irrigated agriculture, as well as the social, public, and cultural infrastructure. Despite the prompt response of a multi-agency mission, which assessed the damage and designed a relief and rehabilitation program of US%230 million to address the most immediate flood relief and rehabilitation needs, very little external assistance has materialiied so far. 3. We appreciate that the Executive Board of the IMF has recognized our difficult situation and has accepted a reduction in Sudan’s payments to the Fund in 1999 to USS40 million. Unless there is another natural catastrophe, we plan to revert to payments of US%60 million in the year 2000. Moreover, in the year 2000 and beyond we will attempt to increase our payments in line with balance of payments developments. The reduction of payments in 1999 will make room for payments to other creditors, some of whom have agreed to provide assistance to rehabilitate areas affected by the floods: We have reached agreements on payments with the Saudi Fund and the African Development Bank. We have also contacted the OPEC Fund and the World Bank; we give high priority to normalizing relations with the Bank. In addition to these creditors, we will continue paying institutions such as the Islamic Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - ATTACHMENT I Devehapment Bank and IFAD, with which we have remained current. Total debt service payments to non-Fund creditors will reach at least US%30 million in 1999. The amount and distribution of these payments should become clearer at the time of the second review of the program, expected to take place in August, once agreements with all creditors have been concluded. However, there is the expectation that if payments to creditors other than the Fund do not reach US%30 million in 1998, the residual amount will be used for further reduction of arrears to the Fund. 4. We would like to assure you and the Executive Board of the IMF that budgetary spending in Sudan takes place within the framework of a transparent budget process, which we will continue to develop. Moreover, parliament reviews and assesses budgetary perform- ance on a quarterly basis. Following the application of the GFS classification, budget transparency will be enhanced further. 5. The medium-term program for 1999-2001 aims to maintain rapid economic growth and to bring down inflation further, while strengthening the foreign reserve position and normalizing relations with creditors. These goals will be achieved through maintaining tight fiscal and monetary policies, while accelerating the pace of structural reforms. The key reforms will be a substantial reduction in average and maximum tariffs and the elimination of all non-tariff barriers on external trade; the continued development of monetary policy instruments, bank supervision, and the foreign exchange market; improved fiscal trans- parency; implementation of the VAT and expansion of the tax base; and privatization and reform of the irrigated schemes. We expect increased tax revenues to enable a significant growth in social and development spending. 6. I would like to underscore, Mr. Managing Director, that these bold reforms may not elicit the desired strong supply response in the absence of external financial support. Specifically, our infrastructure is in a very weak state, after years of minimal public invest- ment, and it will not be possible to finance rehabilitation fully from domestic resources, though we will make every effort to effect a substantial increase in domestic savings in 1999-2001, I therefore request, Mr. Managing Director, that the Fund assume a catalytic role in mobilizing assistance from international institutions and donor countries in support of our program, in the transition period ahead of a Bights Accumulation Program. 7. As regards relations with the Fund, Sudan has demonstrated a strong track record and cooperation under two SMPs in policy implementation, payments, and in the provision of information. In view of this, we request that the IMF consider the reversal of remedial measures as soon as possible. We hope that this reversal would lead to the development of financial package that could help us to normalize relations with the Fund. In this context, we would request that the Fund provide us with a time-bound path for such a resolution.

We would like to take this opportunity to extend, once again our appreciation for the efforts you have personally made in helping Sudan to improve its cooperation with the Fund, and to the staff for the constructive way in which they have followed, resulting in more fruitful cooperation.

This memorandum discusses the macroeconomic outcome in 1998, as well as the govemment’s economic reform program for 1999-2001. The latter includes sections on the medium-term macroeconomic strategy, the macroeconomic program for 1999, and a discussion of the envisaged structural measures. Also attached is a policy matrix. I. Performance Under the 1998 StafFMonitored Program (SMP) 2. A strict fiscal policy was maintained in the last quarter, despite the need for additional expenditures related to flood rehabilitation. The overall deficit for the’year as a whole of 0.7 percent of GDP, as well as domestic financing of 0.5 percent of GDP, was broadly in line with the program targets. Revenues reached 8.0 percent of GDP, about 0.4 percent of GDP lower than anticipated but still 1.3 percentage points higher than in 1997; the shortfall was entirely offset by lower nonwage recurrent and domestically-financed development expenditures. 3. The shortfall in revenues was caused in part by a shift in imports toward lower tariff goods, reflecting flood related imports during the last quarter. Nevertheless, revenues in September-December 1998 were some 40 percent higher than in the same quarter a year earlier, with import duties and domestic consumption taxes showing the strongest increases, partly due to the implementation of the tariff and excise reform in October. 4. A tight monetary policy was maintained in the last quarter of 1998 (especially in December) to ensure that the usual seasonal demand pressures in early 1999 emanating from the need to finance exports and Ramadan were met in an orderly fashion. Sales of Central Bank Musharaka certificates (CMCs) were increased and the stock of outstanding Bank of Sudan (BOS) loans to banks was reduced in December. Consequently, private sector credit was kept within program targets. However, public entities (outside the central government) converted their deposits with the BOS into cash toward the end of December, probably in response to a government circular which called for deposits of ministries to be returned to the main government account before the end of the year, but may have been misinterpreted by entities outside the government. As a result, the quantitative benchmark on net domestic credit was not met, and broad money exceeded the program target modestly (Table 1). Reflecting the restrictive credit policy, the private sector also converted deposits into cash to meet seasonal needs, so that the share of cash in the money supply rose sharply toward the end of the year. Over the year as a whole, the tight monetary policy resulted in inflation being reduced to 8 percent per annum by the end of the year. 5. The overall balance of payments outcome was in line with expectations, although the current account deficit (on a cash basis) for the year as a whole was about 0.5 percent of GDP higher than anticipated. This in large part reflected higher oil-pipeline related imports, which were entirely financed by direct investment, as this project made better-than-expected Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 60 - ATTACHMENT I progress. Despite the difficult economic situation in the Gulf countries, private transfers through official channels were higher than projected due to the improved functioning of the exchange market. Excluding oil pipeline related imports, the current account deficit was 0.6 percentage points of GDP lower than projected. 6. There has been considerable progress in implementing structural measures in recent months. In the fiscal area, an agreement has been reached on the sharing of VAT revenues between the federal government (65 percent) and the states (35 percent). Progress has also been made with respect to training and taxpayer education, although they have not been completed, while the registration of taxpayers can legally only be undertaken once the VAT law is approved. Enabling documents concerning the issuance of the Government Musharaka Certificates (GMCs) have been signed, and a press conference announcing the document has been held. The first GMC are expected to be issued in the first half of May. 7. The exchange regulations and the code of conduct were approved on February 13, 1999 and since end-March, the BOS exchange rate is being calculated as a S-day (instead of 10) moving average of freely determined exchange rates. However, irrespective of the S-day formula, we will at no time set an official rate that deviates by more than 2 percent from the average rate prevailing in the interbank market during the preceding day. The legal reserve requirement is now being applied on a weekly basis, Most banks are reporting on a weekly basis and reserve requirements are estimated at a high level for the few banks that do not report on a weekly basis. II. The Medium-Term Macroeconomic Strategy (1999-2001) 8. The program for 1999-2001 presented below covers the first three years of our four year economic recovery program and has the fidl backing of the government. It builds on the economic reforms undertaken since the mid-1990s, and the progress in macroeconomic stabilization achieved under the 1997 and 1998 SMPs. 9. The objectives of the 1999-2001 program are: (i) to maintain economic growth of about S-S.5 percent; (ii) reduce inflation to 5 percent in 2001; (iii) and reduce the external current account deficit (on a cash basis and excluding the oil trade and pipeline imports) by over 2 percentage points of GDP, with a view to increasing foreign exchange reserves and debt service payments. The latter should contribute to the normalization of relations with some multilateral, regional, and bilateral creditors, which is a major objective of the government, and a resumption of increased financial assistance. 10. Despite the comprehensive reforms that Sudan will be undertaking and the start of oil production, under the baseline scenario economic growth in 1999-2001 is programmed to be maintained at the levels of the previous five years. This is because the current deteriorated state of the irrigation, energy, and transportation infrastructure may not be able to support Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6l- ATTACHMENT I higher growth. However, with limited external support to rebuild the infrastructure, as well as the removal of US. trade and U.N. diplomatic sanctions, which are undermining private sector confidence, growth could reach the 7-8 percent range. 11. A key objective of our medium-term program is to increase domestically-financed public investment (including flood rehabilitation) by about l-2 percentage points of GDP, which could be complemented by an increase in externally financed development outlays as Sudan improves its relations with creditors, The higher public investment will be financed by increased public savings, reflecting an increase in the revenue ratio of 2-3 percentage points (of which over 1 percentage point will come from oil revenues that are expected to come on stream at the beginning of the year 2000 at the latest) and the continued restraint of current non-priority expenditures. The remaining revenue growth is expected to result from the introduction of the VAT and improved tax administration. The projected revenue growth will also enable the government to reduce central bank financing toward the end of the program; a limited amount of domestic financing through the issuance of GMCs should also be available. 12. While private direct investment could decline in 2000 as the oil project is completed, non-oil private investment should rise gradually, in response to the trade and exchange liberalization measures and the improvement in the regulatory environment that is envisaged in the program. 13. The strong export volume response to the structural reforms is expected to continue during the program period, although the recovery of export prices is expected to be modest. In addition, further moderate growth in private transfers is projected, despite the weakness currently being experienced in the Gulf economies, as these transfers are increasingly channeled through official channels in response to the exchange reforms. The continued expansion of exports and private transfers will allow non-oil import volume growth of 6-7 percent per annum, which should be enough to support the projected economic growth. It will also allow for a reduction in the current account deficit (on a cash basis) of about 4 percentage points of GDP, This, coupled with a modest increase in external assistance, will enable a cumulative increase in external reserves of about 3 weeks of imports over 1999-2001. III. The Macroeconomic Program for 1999 14. The macroeconomic program described in our letter of January 28, 1999 remains an appropriate framework for macroeconomic policy in 1999, although the 1999 quantitative benchmarks have been adjusted to take into account the end-1998 outcome (Table 2). The structural benchmarks are given in Annex 1. As anticipated, pressures on the exchange rate and prices did emerge in the first quarter due to the seasonal factors noted above. However, these effects were held in check by BOS restraint in extending credit to banks, as well as a 2 percentage point increase in reserve requirements, In addition, fiscal policy was tightened, as the government postponed some outlays and accumulated net deposits of LSd 20 billion in January-February, compared with the ceiling on domestic financing of LSd 35 billion under Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - ATTACHMENT I the program for January-March. Nevertheless, the twelve-month inflation rose to 13.5 percent in February, and the pound depreciated by 4-5 percent between mid-December and mid- March. 1.5. The above price developments are fully in tine with expectations. Inflation could continue to increase through the summer, but then decline, in line with seasonal factors, so that the end of year and average inflation targets of 10 percent and 14 percent, respectively, should be attainable. The economic growth of about 6 percent anticipated under the program should also be reached despite the greater than expected impact of the floods on cotton, wheat, and groundnuts output, which is likely to be offset by greater than expected rises in rainfed agriculture, livestock and the industrial sector, and oil production could come on- stream a few months before the end-of-the year. 16. As mentioned in our letter of January 28, fiscal policy in 1999 will aim at limiting the overall deficit to 1.0 percent of GDP while reducing slightly the domestically financed deficit to 0.4 percent of GDP (LSd 100 million) (both on a cash basis). Projections of revenues, expenditures, and net foreign financing are unchanged. To protect social and development spending, floors will be set on these outlays, as shown in Table 3. 17. To achieve the inflation and balance of payments objectives of the program, the government intends to further reduce the growth of broad money, while ensuring adequate credit resources for the private sector. This policy will be supported by the ongoing reform of indirect monetary policy instruments, liberaliition of the financial sector, and strengthening of bank supervision, as discussed in paragraphs 35-38 and shown in Annex I. The monetary projections and benchmarks have been adjusted modestly, notably to take into account some rebuilding of the deposits of public entities, as shown in the Table 2. 18. The pursuit of tight fiscal and monetary policies, should help narrow the external current account deficit and build-up gross international reserves. Export proceeds (in U.S. dollar terms) are now projected to increase only modestly during 1999, reflecting lower export volumes of cotton, sesame, and groundnuts, as the flood damage incurred by the irrigated schemes was much greater than initially expected. At the same time, imports are expected to decline by over 11 percent largely reflecting lower import needs for the con- struction of the oil pipeline. However, when the oil pipeline-related imports are excluded, total imports are expected to grow by about 5 percent. The external current account deficit (on a cash basis) is expected to narrow by 3.5 percentage points of GDP (from an estimated 9.8 percent of GDP in 1998). IV. Structural Reforms, 19994001 19. The main thrust of the structural reforms is to enhance the openness of the economy and ensure that sufficient resources are available for investment in improved social services and infrastructure, despite foreign exchange constraints, through reform of the tax system and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - ATTACHMENT I administration. At the same time, we will improve the functioning of macroeconomic policy instruments, enhance the efficiency and transparency of government operations, and restructure or privatize public enterprises, including the irrigated schemes. These efforts aim to consolidate the liberalization and public enterprise reforms that have been carried out since the early 1990s. Fiscal reforms 20. To achieve the revenue objective of the program, the government will first focus on implementing the VAT. Many of the preparatory steps have already been taken, but work is still needed to complete the taxpayer education program, and the training of the operational staff in the VAT department. Following the agreement with the states, Parliament is expected to discuss the VAT law by September. Following enactment of the VAT law and the passage of a constitutional amendment allowing the modification of the revenue sharing arrangement between the federal government and states, the VAT is expected to be implemented by January 1, 2000 at the latest. 21. Customs and Tax administration will be furtherreinforced through strengthening of the large taxpayer unit and implementing a plan of action that would result in the adoption of a unified taxpayer identification number for large taxpayers by the end of 1999, and for other taxpayers one year later. The government is also keen to reform the direct tax system in the context of the year 2001 budget, with a view to widening the tax base and improving administration. A tiuther reduction in income tax rates could.also be considered if it does not endanger the achievement of the medium-term fiscal objectives of the program. A review of customs administration is also envisaged. We would appreciate Fund technical assistance in reviewing the direct tax system and customs administration in 2000. 22. Much of the increase in central government expenditures during 1999-2001 will be directed to social and development spending, and these categories of expenditures are expected to be increased as a percentage of GDP over the program period. With the normalization of relations with other creditors, we also expect to be able to increase foreign- financed development spending. 23. The government also intends to take steps to further enhance the accountability and transparency of the budgetary process. We already have a budget law and there is quarterly discussion and scrutiny of the budget by Parliament. An independent Audit Office guarantees the integrity of the fiscal accounts. In 1999, the budget was harmonized with the macro- economic framework. Moreover, we will work toward the formulation of a medium-term expenditure and budget framework, encompassing both current and capital expenditures, and the development of comprehensive, timely, and accurate government accounts with an improved classification that conveys fuller and more relevant information about government activities. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 64 - ATTACHMENT I 24. In 1999, we expect to be able to report expenditures on the basis of the GFS classification. However, full introduction of the GFS classification for the government budget, including domestic reporting with budgetary accounts coded accordingly, is expected to take place in 2001, In 1999, we also expect to be able to prepare monthly accounts by the Federal Chamber of Accounts on the basis of reports by line ministries. Over the three-year period covered by the program, the government will: (i) move to a rolling cash planning exercise and share the cash allocation plan with ministries, and introduce commitment accounting; and (ii) fully integrate the development and recurrent budgets. 25. The states play an important role in the Sudanese fiscal system, especially as they are responsible for the bulk of health and education expenditures. The finances of states have been under increasing pressure, with arrears emerging as a problem. At the same time, the states are resorting to distortionary agricultural taxation and taxes on interstate trade, which are undermining the competitiveness of the traded goods sector. 26. The government is working to find more effective means of mobilizing resource to finance the activities of the states. The VAT revenue sharing agreement is a step in the right direction, and federal transfers to the states (mostly used for social spending) are budgeted to rise sharply in 1998 and are expected to tinther increase gradually, but more profound reforms may be necessary. A committee is studying the fiscal relationship between the federal government and the states, including revenue sharing, and is expected to report by end-1999, with a full set of recommendations agreed at the cabinet level by mid-1999. We would welcome Fund technical assistance to support the work of this committee. 27. Transfers to the states will be made conditional upon the provision of timely financial reports by the states and use of adequate transfers for social purposes, as determined by audit. From the year 2000 states will need to report actual data with only a six-month lag. Exchange and trade reforms 28. The objective of the exchange and trade reforms is to open the economy finther by promoting export growth, while reducing the cost of imported goods. In particular, the government is committed to trade liberalization, in the context of its objective ofjoining the WTO and participating in COMESA. 29. The cornerstone of the government’s trade liberalization program is the planned reduction in the average customs tariff from 25 percent currently to under 15 percent in the 2002 budget. This would be achieved through a schedule of tariff reductions shown in the attached Annex II, including a reduction in the maximum tariff from 80 percent currently, to 30 percent in the 2002 budget, and a reduction in the number of tariff bands from 5 currently to 3 during the same period. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 65 - ATTACHMENT I 30. In addition to the tariff reform, the government is committed to the elimination of the few remaining nontariff barriers to exports and imports. Most importantly, by mid-1999 the requirement that traders obtain a stamp of approval from the Ministry of Commerce before exporting or importing will be removed, though they will continue to provide information on their contracts to the ministry for statistical and monitoring purposes. This will enable the ministry to continue to fidfill its primary role as a promoter of exports. With this move, the issue of minimum export prices will be finally removed from the agenda. In addition, the ban on the export of raw skins and hides will be removed by mid-1999, and export taxes on cotton will be eliminated m the context of the year 2000 budget, while export taxes on gum arabic will be reconsidered in light of an overall review of the taxation of this sector. On the import side, the positive list of essential goods (the only non-tariff import restriction) which can be imported using bank credit facilities will be expanded in steps, in June and December 1999, with a view to its elimination by June 2000. 3 1. The BOS will continue to allow the exchange rate of the Sudanese dinar to be determined in the market, with stability promoted through fiscal and monetary policies. This market is still at a relatively early stage of development, with little active commercial bank intermediation, as most of these banks prefer to transact at or close to the moving average rate. Moreover, because of the thinness of the market transactions are dispersed over a 2-3 percent range during periods of pressure on the currency. 32. To improve the functioning of the foreign exchange market, the 10 day moving average as a basis for calculating the BOS exchange rate was reduced to 5 days at end-March. Our ultimate objective is to move to daily setting of the BOS rate, and this issue will be reconsidered at the time of the tirst review of the 1999 program. At that time, we will also revisit the issues of the extension of the IO day period for exporters to sell their foreign exchange proceeds, with the expectation that this step will be taken some time during 1999 or in early 2000. To improve monitoring of the market, from end-April 1999, we will also begin to calculate (and report to the IMF on a weekly basis) the daily average rate. 33. We are happy to inform you that under the new foreign exchange regulations issued on February 13, 1999 commercial banks are allowed to intermediate in the foreign exchange market, including through transactions for their own account, although a certain reluctance on the part of banks is still visible. To facilitate commercial bank intermediation, the 2-day limit on the banks to sell foreign exchange will be eliminated in June 1999. The operation of the market will be deepened by eliminating the surrender requirements that remain on cotton and gum arabic by end-June 1999. 34. Foreign exchange intervention in 1999 will be undertaken only to smooth out short- term fluctuations in the exchange market, and will be consistent with the overall target of building-up usable foreign exchange reserves by US$20 million during the year. The BOS is working to develop its operations capacity in the foreign exchange and money markets, and has requested the Fund to provide an expert to assist in this regard. Until we develop this capacity, the BOS may conduct occasional buy or sell auctions of foreign exchange. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 66 - ATTACHMENT I 35. During the program period, the government does not intend to introduce or intensify any exchange restrictions, introduce or modify any multiple currency practices, conclude any bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, or introduce or intensify import restrictions for balance of payments purposes. The government is working toward the settlement of balances under the inoperative bilateral payments arrangement with Egypt. Financial sector reforms 36. Financial sector reforms in 1999-2001 will focus on completing the development of indirect financial instruments and on strengthening the soundness of the banking system. With the introduction of the GMC, the BOS will have two instruments with which to conduct open market operations. Concerning the CMC, the BOS will endeavor to coordinate the price policy relating to on-demand buybacks with the timing and size of buy-back auctions in order to secure effective control of short-term liquidity fluctuations and avoid destabiliing pressures in the foreign exchange market. We expect to start using the GMC in open market operations some time in the second half of the year, once they have been issued in sutficient number. We are also committed to strengthening the effectiveness of these two instruments in open market operations by the introduction of an auction mechanism for BOS financing, and the development of an effective overdraft facility and lender of last resort facility. These steps, however, require more consideration, and a firmer decision and timetable regarding their introduction will be taken at the time of the first review of the 1999 program. 37. Our objective in 1999-2001 is to reduce the cost of financial intermediation by lowering the overall reserve requirement, through a gradual convergence of the domestic and foreign currency reserve requirements, For Ii111 unification, the required reserves on foreign currency deposits will be held entirely in foreign currency rather than giving banks the option of keeping these reserves in domestic or foreign currency. Reserve requirements will be adjusted downward gradually, in line with liquidity conditions. Indeed, in 1999 an increase in overall reserve requirements (as well as the reintroduction of bank finance ceilings as a last resort) may be required if liquidity expansion is deemed to be excessive, or stronger pressures on the currency develop, as our indirect instruments are still in the development stage. 38. The government believes that strengthening prudential supervision is critical to ensuring a sound banking system. To this end, the BOS will examine, with Fund technical assistance, in AprilMay 1999, the status of compliance with key prudential regulations (including notably as regards commercial banks’ foreign currency exposure), assess technical assistance needs in bank supervision, and develop an action plan for 1999. Regardless of the outcome of this review, by June 1999, the Bank of Sudan will agree with commercial banks on measures to reduce the size of nonperforming loans, and ensure that provisioning is adequate. We recognize that these measures will be effective only with the fidl introduction of a new bank accounting system, as well as standard&ion of bank income and profit statements. Some banks have already begun to implement these measures, and all banks are expected to adapt them by September 1999. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 67 - ATTACHMENT I 39. As regards bank supervision, the BOS will enforce prudential regulations rigorously. There will be a shift in emphasis from on-site inspection to the evaluation of bank soundness, performed “top-down” rather than “bottom-up”. Efforts to train bank supervisors will also be stepped-up, as described in the attached matrix. The regulatory environment 40. As part of its efforts to ensure an enhanced free market environment for private sector activity and investment, the government intends to significantly improve the regulatory framework over the period 1999-2001. For this purpose, priority will be attached to the early completion of the ongoing review of the Investment Encouragement Act with, a view to adopting the revised act by year end. While the law has succeeded in attracting domestic and foreign investment, it has also resulted in a lack of transparency and a heavy fiscal cost arising from a proliferation of tax and tariff exemptions granted by different line ministries. Moreover, loopholes in the law have led to abuses, which have been compounded by the absence of a monitoring system concerning the track record of the beneficiaries as regards investment and other bona fide commitments justifying the concessions. A major objective in modifying the law is eliminating the customs exemptions on inputs. If this is not possible, we will temporarily limit this exemption to a finite number of years, but no more than three. Other key elements of the revised law will be: (i) the centralization of the authority to grant exemptions regarding federal taxes, possibly at the Ministry of Investment and Cooperation, with a Ministerial Committee, that includes the Ministry of Finance, taking the final decision; and (ii) elimination of the renewal of expiring exemptions, including for enterprises that have undergone a transfer of ownership and/or have entered a rehabilitation process. The revised law will seek to ensure a simplification and acceleration of clearance procedures for investment licensing, including the introduction of “one-stop procedures,” as well as a more effective monitoring of investors’ commitments. 41. A number of other regulatory reforms will also be pursued once technical assistance from bilateral/multilateral donors/creditors is secured. It is essential to review labor market regulations and reform; the judicial and legal system, to provide investors with the required guarantees in the settlement of labor and contractual disputes as well as property rights; and ensure an environment of fair competition. Agricultural reform 42. Agriculture is the backbone of the Sudanese economy, accounting for about 40 percent of GDP, 80 percent of employment, and the bulk of exports. The economic liberalization policies pursued by the government since the mid-1990s have suited the agricultural sector well, and it has recorded strong growth since 1992/93. In particular, the liberalization of prices, marketing and the foreign exchange regime have supported agri- cultural growth. Much of this strong growth has come from the rainfed and livestock sectors, as well as the large increase in output of fruits and vegetables. However, the major agri- cultural schemes, that dominate the irrigated sector, have fared less well under the reforms, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 68 - ATTACHMENT I and cotton output in these schemes has declined over the past 5 years. As part of its deregulation efforts, crop selection, financing, and some aspects of water management were transferred to farmers and farmers associations, while pricing and marketing were liberalized. However, some of the problems of the schemes persisted and several new ones emerged. In particular, financing problems have arisen, because of the elimination of the BOS financing to the schemes and difficulties faced by irrigated schemes in recovering land and water charges from the farmers, which have affected the capacity to pay for the desilting and weeding of canals. Consequently, the canals, as well as other infrastructure deteriorated, and the areas under cultivation and production in the schemes have declined. 43. Aware of these problems, the President appointed a committee to study the organizational and financing problems facing the schemes. This committee has concentrated on the Gezira scheme (by far the largest) and has recommended that it be decentralized and that many of the units providing supplementary services (agricultural engineering, canal maintenance, storage, telecommunications,. transportation) be opened for private investment. The decentralization process has been initiated, and the delivery of services has been opened to the private sector, in some of these areas in competition with units owned by the Sudan Gezira Board. While we expect the land and the main canals and pumps to remain under government ownership, the key issue of the ownership and management by the Sudan Gezira Board, which operates most of the infrastructure, is still under consideration. To deal with this challenge, the government is developing an action plan to reform comprehensively the Sudan Gezira Board. We hope that with an agreement to normaliie financial relations with the World Bank, the Bank will be able to provide technical assistance to support the develop- ment of this plan. Given the complexity of the issues involved, a plan will be ready for implementation by end-1999. Subsequently, plans for the other major schemes (Rahad, New Halfa, Suki) will be developed, based on the evaluation of progress in restructuring the Gezira Scheme. However, after years of under-investment, the fill rehabilitation of the irrigated schemes is beyond the capacity of domestic savings and will require external support. 44. In addition to the reform of the irrigated schemes, the government will support the agricultural sector by increasing allocations for rural infrastructure and extension and research services. We expect to maintain the share of agriculture in total development expenditures at least at 40 percent, which given the growth in total public investment should ensure an increase in real terms. In addition, the government will work with the states to limit the total tax burden on agriculture to 20 percent of the value of output in the rainfed sector and IS percent in the irrigated sector. Public enterprise reform 45. The public enterprise reform program was initiated under the Privatization of State Corporation Act of 1990, aimed at limiting the role of the public sector in activities that the private sector could otherwise undertake, reducing the burden of subsidies on the budget and improving the financial strength of the enterprises. So far, close to 60 (out of some 200) enterprises involved in banking, agriculture, manufacturing, real estate and various services Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 69 - ATTACHMENT I have been liquidated, privatized or turned into joint ventures. In the case of the large scale entities, such as telecommunications and irrigation infrastructure, initial reforms involved private management, while the government retained majority ownership. In addition, some roads and electricity generating plants have been leased to the private sector to operate. 46. The government is now in the second phase of the reform program, covering 1998-2000. Candidate enterprises include the Sudan Airways, Sudan Shipping Line, Electricity Corporation, Sudan Railway Corporation, Sudan Telecommunications (Sudatel), and assorted smaller units. Improving the performance of these large enterprises would strengthen the infrastructure, and improve the outlook for growth. The reform program involves using diverse instruments, including public share offers, direct sale, enlistment of skilled private management, contracting of services and elimination of state monopoly to, facilitate private sector entry into these sectors, Nevertheless, the overall pace of implementation of public enterprise reforms has been slow, due to constraining factors, especially the large size of some enterprises and related large financial requirements, the thin stock market, concerns of affected workers and user groups, and retrenchment costs. 47. Given the constraints on the market and slow progress in privatizing the large enterprises and banks, faster progress seems more likely for the smaller units and joint venture banks (Annex III). The smaller units approved for evaluation and processing for sale include those in cement, agriculture, textiles and commerce. We recognize that a transparent process, including a perception of fair pricing of assets and supportive regulatory regime, is critical for keeping public support for the reforms. The oil sector 48. The government has continued to encourage an increasing role of the private sector in petroleum activities. In 1998, imports of crude and imports and distribution of diesel, which had been reserved for the Government Petroleum Corporation (GPC), were opened to private sector participation, Nevertheless, the GPC has remained involved in the import of these products either individually or in conjunction with private enterprises, including of gasoline on the occasions when the private sector has been unable to secure external financing and/or storage facilities. Overall, however, the private sector is fully involved in the importation, refining, distribution, and marketing of petroleum products, and its role is expected to be facilitated with the coming on stream of oil production. As regards pricing, the government will continue to implement a policy of avoiding subsidization by adjusting domestic prices whenever warranted by international price increases. Social spending 49. The government is committed to protect and support the most vulnerable sections of the society through priority spending in the budget on key social sectors. With this objective, the government shall increase budgetary support to the critical areas of social development, especially education, health and poverty alleviation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 70 - ATTACHIvlENT I 50. Under the Sudanese constitution, basic education and primary health care fall within the jurisdiction of the states, as noted above. Higher education and specialized medical care are federal responstbilities, but are supported by the federal budget. The government is committed to universal primary education and to extend primary health care to 100 percent of the population. There are, however, two major constraints: lack of adequate resources and lack of an information base to develop appropriate strategies. Other factors, especially the conflict and the recent floods, have increased the already heavy pressures and added to these constraints. In particular, the conflict has resulted in sharply increased medical rehabilitation needs. At the same time, the recent floods have further eroded rural income and resulted in higher incidence of many diseases thereby stretching the already inadequate social and health infrastructure. 51. As a first step in this direction, the government has decided to consider the current level of transfers to states for investment spending in primary health and education, and water provision as priority areas, and to protect them in the event of fiscal stress. Our ultimate objective is to phase out current transfers to states (by 2000), so that all federal transfers are used by the states for investment. We will impose conditionalities on the transfers to ensure that resources are spent on priority social sectors. The government will continue to encourage community and local level support for the delivery of social services. At the same time, the government shall develop information systems and appropriate social indicators to monitor the status of primary and school education and primary health care. The government shall develop appropriate indicators to monitor progress in school enrollment and in expanding primary health coverage. 52. The government has also started a national poverty alleviation program. The main objective of the program is to reach out to all the families below the poverty line, estimated at 25 percent of the population or 1.3 million families. The program targets family as the basic unit and seeks to identify and meet the minimum needs in the critical areas (among others) of health, education, shelter, provision of clean drinking water and nutrition to maintain sustainable development. The program has already started and a survey for basic data has already been initiated. While the government is committed to provide adequate resources to this program, more technical and other assistance will be needed to fully meet the objectives of this program. 53. Although many bilateral and multilateral agencies are helping the government in the social areas, their efforts are focussed on humanitarian assistance. More technical and other support is needed to achieve the social development objectives (see matrix). The government hopes that the World Bank will support these efforts through technical assistance as we make a commitment to normalize our financial relations with the Bank, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicTable 1.
