Real GDP is estimated to have grown by only 0.3 percent and the unemployment rate rose to 14.4 percent, while inflation remained below 1 percent. The weak domestic demand contributed to a substantial reduction in the external current account deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP from 9.3 percent in 2000. Although the central government refrained from a counter cyclical increase in spending, Panama’s fiscal performance deteriorated sharply in 200 1, with the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) deficit widening to 2.5 percent of GDP from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2000 (based on Fund methodology), mainly because of a large decline in tax revenue and a worsening of the finances of the social security system.’ Despite these adverse developments, the country risk premium, as indicated by the spread on Panama’s sovereign debt, declined from 500 basis points at the beginning of 2001 to 359 basis points at the end-April 2002. This may be partially explained by the substantial progress in strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework of the banking system, and the consensus reached in the National Dialogue for Economic Recovery including: (i) allowing the Fondo Fiduciario (Fiduciary Fund) to buy back up to US$l billion of Panamanian global bonds, and (ii) the establishment of debt and fiscal deficit ceilings. The Assembly approved a law encompassing these agreements in May 2002. A May 2001 OFC Module II mission found Panama to be compliant with 23 out of 25 Base1 core principles, including those related to anti-money laundering. In June 2001, the FATF removed Panama from its list of noncooperating countries. In May 2002, Panama was removed from the OECD list of noncooperating countries related to Harmful Tax Practices. Discussions between the staff and the authorities centered around the economic outlook for 2002, the prospects for fiscal policy, and the pending structural reforms to raise economic growth in the medium-term. Real GDP is expected to growth by 1.2 percent in 2002, based largely on the expected recovery of the U.S. economy. The fiscal deficit would rise to 2.7 percent of GDP (or 1.7 percent of GDP under the authorities’ methodology), consistent with the new fiscal responsibility law. The staff advised the authorities about the need to strengthen their expenditure and revenues policies, including the adoption of a revenue enhancing tax reform proposal and revising the general framework for granting wage increases to civil servants. A reform of the social security, which is actuarially insolvent, will also be key for the medium-term viability of the fiscal accounts. The staff encouraged the authorities to concentrate resources on upgrading procedures for bank inspections and on strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for the nonbank financial institutions. The precautionary 2 1 -month Stand-by Arrangement, approved by the Executive Board on June 30, 2000, expired in March 2002. The program was off track since the beginning of 200 1. ’ The Panamanian authorities recorded a lower deficit, 1.5 percent of GDP, due to the treatment of future interest receipts from the Fiduciary Fund, as current revenues.

A staff team visited Panama November 25-December lo,2001 to conduct the 2002 Article IV consultation discussions.2 The mission met with the Ministers of Finance and Labor, the Superintendent of Banks, senior government officials, and representatives of the banking and business sectors. The wrap-up meeting with the Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance was held in Washington April 4-5, 2002.3 2. The 2000 Article IV consultation was concluded on January 22, 200 1. At that time, Executive Directors encouraged the authorities to persevere in their efforts toward fiscal consolidation, especially by adhering to the fiscal deficit targets in the program supported by the Stand-By Arrangement.4 Directors also urged the authorities to advance structural reforms, especially those included in the program on the tax system, social security, and financial sector supervision, in order to enhance overall economic efficiency and achieve the government’s social objectives. 3. While substantial progress was achieved in the reform of bank regulation and supervision, and the end-December 2000 performance criteria on the PSBR of the nonfinancial public sector was observed, Panama did not meet two structural performance criteria and most structural benchmarks were not achieved or only partially achieved (Table l).5 Thus, the first review under the arrangement, originally envisaged for December 2000, did not take place and the stand-by arrangement expired at end-March 2002.6 During the Article IV mission in December 2001, the staff and the authorities agreed 2 The staff team comprised Mr. Alleyne (Head), Mr. Bindley-Taylor, Ms. Cebotari, Messrs. Guimaraes and Papaioannou (all WHD), and Ms. Pinillos (Assistant, WHD). Mr. Macia, Advisor to the Executive Director for Panama, participated in the discussions. 3 Since in December 2001 the authorities had yet to decide on important aspects of their economic program for 2002, mainly on account of a national dialogue that was ongoing, it was agreed to postpone the wrap-up of the Article IV discussions until January. Due to subsequent postponements and scheduling difficulties this meeting was not held until April. 4 A 2 1 -month stand-by arrangement for SDR 64 million (3 1 percent of quota) was approved by the Executive Board on June 30,200O. 5 The authorities failed to submit legislation to: (i) broaden the base of the VAT and increase the effective rate of taxation of bank income; and (ii) close the National Mortgage Bank. These pieces of legislation still have not been submitted to the Assembly. 6 The stand-by arrangement was intended to be precautionary and the authorities did not make any purchases under the arrangement.

The past year has been characterized by a fractious political climate and, until very recently, the lack of agreement between the government and the opposition, which controls the legislative assembly, on the appropriate policy response to the economic challenges facing the country. The National Dialogue for Economic Recovery, which began in October 2001 as an attempt to forge a consensus among political parties and business and labor groups on economic policy, only recently produced agreements on some of the major issues under discussion. A law incorporating these agreements, i.e., on the use of the Fiduciary Fund for Development (FFD),7 the establishment of ceilings on public debt and the fiscal deficit, and the use of government assets to finance a few specific infrastructure projects, was approved by the Assembly in May 2002 (Box 1). 5. There have been some significant improvements in the quality of economic statistics in the past year and a half estimates of quarterly GDP growth began to be produced in 200 1, and the authorities began participating in the General Data Dissemination System in December 2000. Nevertheless, the remaining shortcomings in the coverage reliability and timeliness of economic statistics hamper their usefulness for economic analysis and surveillance. For example, comprehensive fiscal data for the nonfinancial public sector for 2001 were not publicly available until early April; net errors and omissions in the balance of payments (BOP) accounts are large; and the national income and BOP accounts do not fully incorporate the economic activities of the reverted areas.8 6. Panama has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Appendix I summarizes Panama’s relations with the Fund. II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 7. Real GDP growth slowed for the third consecutive year to 0.3 percent in 2001, compared with 2.5 percent in 2000, and 3.2 percent in 1999. The slowdown in economic activity reflected not only the slowdown in the global economy, but also the deceleration in 7 The Fondo Fiduciario Para el Desavrollo contains the proceeds from the privatization of government enterprises. As of December 3 1,2001, the fund’s assets amounted to US$1,252 million (12 percent of GDP), earning an average rate of return of 6.07 percent. ’ Appendix V contains a detailed description of statistical issues.

Panama: Economic Recovery and Fiscal Responsibility Law The National Dialogue has reached consensus on three important areas: (i) authorizing the Trust Fund (Fond0 Fiduciario-FFD) to spend up to US$200 million on infrastructure projects of high social impact and invest up to 100 percent of the remaining funds in Panama global bonds; (ii) using the assets of the reverted areas to finance specific investment projects; and (iii) establishing a debt ceiling of 50 percent of GDP while at the same time limiting the annual growth of total net debt to 80 percent of the growth of nominal GDP, provided that the fiscal deficit does not exceed 2 percent of GDP. The definition of net debt is different from that which is used by the staff (see Table 8). A law encompassing these agreements was approved by the Assembly in May 2002. The first part of the law authorizing the use of US$200 million form the FFD is expected to boost employment creation in the short term. One of the projects, the Interamerican Highway, is priced at US$90 million and is expected to improve competitiveness and promote regional integration by reducing transportation costs and enhancing synergies across sectors. The second project, which will cost US$70 million, will channel funds to IDAAN, the state-owned water and sanitation company, to rehabilitate and expand infrastructure and services. The remaining USS40 million will be invested in irrigation to increase productivity in the agricultural sector. The first two projects would be ready to begin in the second half of 2002 while the third would begin in 2003. The debt buyback operation (up to 100 percent of the remaining funds, approximately US$l billion) may be used to buy back Panama global bonds. The idea is to reduce the interest servicing cost of the debt (given that the average rate of return on the FFD, at 6.1 percent in 2001, has been lower than the yield on Panama’s globals at over 9 percent), and at the same time reduce the debt of the consolidated public sector. The second part of the law identifies five specific projects to be financed, in part, from the sale of assets of the reverted areas. The projects include: completing the Panama City-Colon highway, an environmental cleanup of the Panama Bay, low-income housing, internet access for public schools, and “Ciudad Gubemamental”. According to the Ministry of Finance, the highway and housing projects could start in 2002, the Panama Bay project in 2003 and the internet project in 2003-04. The third part of the law establishes net debt and deficit ceilings for the public sector. Under the law, the net debt to GDP ratio would have to decline gradually to 50 percent (from approximately 70 percent). In order to achieve this benchmark, the law imposes limits on the fiscal deficits. First, the deficit should not exceed 2 percent of GDP. Second, if the annual growth of nominal GDP is above 1.5 percent, the net debt cannot grow by more than 80 percent of the nominal GDP growth, and if the growth rate of nominal GDP is less than 1.5 percent, the net debt is not constrained to grow by a percentage of nominal GDP growth, but the deficit still has to be less than 2 percent of GDP. For purposes of the law, nominal GDP of a given year is calculated on the basis of the 12 months ended June of that year. A commission has been set up to work out the practical details of implementing the new fiscal rules. These constraints have important implications for debt dynamics. If the real GDP growth rate is above 1.5 percent, then the ratio of net debt to GDP ratio obviously decreases since the net debt can only increase by 80 percent of nominal GDP growth. If real GDP growth less than 1.5 percent, then the ratio of net debt to GDP ratio may increase depending on the growth of GDP deflator (and ultimately nominal GDP). From an initial net debt to GDP ratio of 70 percent, nominal GDP growth of at least 2.94 percent will prevent the net debt to GDP ratio from increasing, assuming that the government allows the deficit to reach the legal maximum of 2 percent of nominal GDP. Over the last 10 years (1992-2001) the average annual real GDP growth was 3.6 percent, with real growth falling below 1.5 percent in only two of those years (1995 and 2001). If past economic performance is a reasonable indicator of the future, the fiscal responsibility law implies a declining net debt to GDP ratio over the medium term.

The events of September 11, 2001 also contributed to a downturn in economic activity in the last two quarters of 200 1, especially in the key sectors that are oriented towards the external sector. The Monthly Index of Economic Activity (IMAE) fell by 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 2001 relative to the same period in 2000, and was basically flat in the fourth quarter. Economic activity in the first two months of 2002 continued to be weak, with the TMAE declining by 0.5 percent relative to the same period in 2001. 8. The slowdown in economic activity was not even across sectors. Some sectors such as ports, telecommunications, and nontraditional exports experienced strong growth, at double-digits rates in some cases, while those oriented to the domestic market, such as manufacturing, commerce, and agriculture, suffered declines (Figure 2). Because the growing sectors tend to be capital intensive relative to the depressed ones, the unemployment rate rose from 13.5 percent in 2000 to 14.4 percent in 2001, reaching 16.6 percent in urban areas. 9. The weak domestic demand put downward pressure on inflation, which fell to 0.3 percent in 2001 (12-month basis) from 0.7 percent a year earlier, and contributed to a reduction in the external current account deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP from 9.3 percent in 2000. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 1.5 percent in the year ended December 200 1 (Figure 3). 10. Panama’s fiscal performance deteriorated sharply in 2001 mainly because of a 7.3 percent decline in tax revenue and a worsening of the finances of the social security system. The nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) registered a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP in 200 1, compared with 0.7 percent a year earlier, as the central government deficit widened to 3.1 percent of GDP from 1.3 percent, and the surplus of the social security system declined to 0.4 percent of GDP from 1.7 percent (Figure 4). lo Revenue from business income tax and import tariffs both declined by more than 14 percent, and the central government did not reduce spending enough to offset this sharp decline in revenue. 9 These projects included the construction of the Interoceanic (Panama City-Colon) Highway and Railway, and the expansion of the Interamerican Highway and the Manzanillo and Balboa ports. lo According to the government’s official figures, the deficit of the NFPS in 200 1 was 1.4 percent of GDP, and the deficit of the central government was 1.8 percent of GDP. The difference from the staffs estimate arises from the different treatment of part of the transfers to the government from the FFD (see Box 3).

The decline in tax revenue in 2001 was substantially more than could be attributed to purely cyclical factors. The drop in corporate tax revenue, which began in 2000, reflects to a large extent, the unevenness of economic growth across sectors. Because the growing sectors enjoy large tax incentives relative to the depressed sectors, corporate income tax collections fell in absolute terms although aggregate nominal GDP growth remained positive. In the case of import tariff revenue, collections fell more than proportionately than the decline in imports because of the particularly sharp contraction in the imports of consumer durables. The decline in these imports, which have the highest tariff rates, is associated with the deceleration in the growth of consumer credit. The decline in VAT collections, which also began in 2000, is associated with the lower imports and a possible increased rate of delinquency in response to deteriorating economic conditions. 12. Total expenditure of the central government in 2001 (as a percent of GDP) remained unchanged from its level of the previous two years. In the face of the decline in revenue, the central government reduced current spending from 19.6 percent of GDP in 2000 to 19.4 percent of GDP in 2001, by decreasing outlays on goods and services and transfers to the rest of the public sector. Savings in these areas more than offset increases in wages, mainly resulting from automatic increases granted to some categories of workers; and higher external interest payments arising from large debt placements (to pre-fund 2002 debt service obligations), and a scheduled increase in Brady bond interest payments. Capital outlays were increased from 2.8 percent of GDP to 3.0 percent as the government attempted to provide a some boost to employment and economic activity. 13. The surplus of the social security system declined sharply in 2001 as the structural deterioration in its finances was exacerbated by cyclical factors. Payroll contributions declined as a result of the higher unemployment rates and a likely increase in delinquency rates reflecting the weak economy. At the same time, the growth rate of benefits, which has been increasing faster than that of contributions in recent years, was boosted by an increase in the rate of retirements, and a substantial rise in the use of health clinics and services provided by the system (replacing the more expensive private health services). These phenomena were also largely attributable to the weakness in economic activity. The rest of the nonfinancial public sector, including the public enterprises and the autonomous government agencies, improved their financial positions, primarily through equal reductions in current and capital expenditures. The deficit of the nonfinancial public sector was financed largely from external sources, while net bank credit from both the Banco National and private commercial banks declined. Financing of US$ 100 million was also obtained from the FFD. 14. Despite the deterioration in the public finances, which led Standard and Poors to downgrade Panamanian debt in November 2001, spreads on Panama’s debt declined from 500 basis points at the beginning of 2001 to 359 basis points at end-April 2002 (Figure 5). In 200 1, the government raised US$l . 1 billion in international bond markets, including placement of a US$750 million IO-year global bond. With these proceeds, the government covered its scheduled external 200 1 amortization payments, retired some Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - domestic treasury notes, repurchased and retired about US$l50 million of Brady Bond debt, and pre-funded the entire scheduled US$500 million February 2002 bond amortization payment.” The gross stock of debt of the NFPS at end-2001 amounted to 74.8 percent of GDP, with external debt at 61.6 percent of GDP. Adjusting for the pre-funding of the 2002 amortization payment, gross debt of the NFPS amounted to 70.8 percent of GDP at end-2001. 15. The rate of growth of net domestic assets of the banking system declined from an average of 25 percent in 1998-99 to 7 percent in 2001, as banks switched from borrowing abroad (to lend domestically) in 1998 and 1999, to an accumulation of foreign assets in 2000 and 2001, This change reflects a sharp deceleration in the growth of credit to the private sector which, after averaging over 20 percent a year in 1998-99, declined to 7% percent at end-2001, as banks became concerned about the quality of these credits.12 However, the expansion of credit also was curtailed to comply with new prudential asset quality regulations that came into effect at the beginning of 2001. Bank lending and deposit interest rates fell during 200 1, though by less than in the United States, with rates offered by foreign-owned banks declining more than those offered by Panamanian-headquartered banks (see Figure 5 and Box 2).13 16. In recent years, Panama has achieved substantial progress in strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework of the banking system. Banking conditions remain basically sound. The average risk-weighted capital to asset ratio was 14 percent in 2001 for Panama headquartered banks, well above the regulatory minimum of 8 percent. Nonperforming loans rose to 2.0 percent of total loans from 1.5 percent in 2000 but provisioning rates remained well over 100 percent. In November 2000, the Superintendency of Banks completed its own assessment (which was reviewed by MAE) of Panama’s compliance with the Base1 Core Principles of Effective Banking Supervision, and then in May 200 1, a Fund mission completed a stand-alone assessment of that compliance under Module 2 of the offshore financial centers initiative. l4 That mission found Panama to be compliant or largely compliant with 23 (out of the 25) core principles, including those l1 In July 2001, the authorities prepaid US$160 million of Panama’s debt falling due in February 2002. l2 The expansion in personal consumer credit declined from 3 1 percent in 1999 to 2 percent in 2001. l3 Deposit rates of Panamanian-headquartered banks fell from 7.2 percent to 5.9 percent during the year ended December 200 1, while the rates of foreign-owned banks declined from 5.9 percent to 2.5 percent. l4 At the request of the authorities, the assessment was published in October 2001 on the website of the Superintendency of Banks.

Panama: Interest Rate Developments in Panama During 2001 The integration of the Panamanian financial system in global markets ensured that domestic interest rates fell in tandem with world rates in 2001, but the decrease was more pronounced in foreign banks. Foreign banks reduced their deposit rates by an average of 340 basis points during the 12-month period ended December 2001, compared to a fall in Libor rates (6 month) of 420 basis points during the same period. At the same time, rates of Panamanian-headquartered banks fell by an average of only 130 basis points. The apparent lag in adjusting the rates reflects, in part, the fact that interest rates are reported on an average basis, whereas the Libor and the U.S. prime rate are marginal rates and hence reflect adjustments instantaneously. Those banks that cannot reprice their liabilities rapidly because of the longer-term nature of their funding or a larger share of fixed-rate obligations would report slower falling average rates, even if the rates on newly-contracted obligations are reduced fast. This appears to be the case with the Panamanian-headquartered banks, which fund themselves mostly in the local deposit market and which have made a sustained effort during the last several years to lengthen the maturity of their liabilities, with a view to both match the maturity profile of their assets and to ensure a more stable funding base. These banks dominate the residential mortgage market and hence the maturity profile of their assets tends to be relatively long-term. In addition, during the boom in consumer credit in 1997-1999, the maturity of many consumer credits had been extended to keep or attract customers, which again lengthened the maturity of the banks’ loan portfolios. Thus, to match their asset maturity profile, these banks lengthened the maturity of their deposit base, with a large share of these deposits being fixed-term. This has also helped them ensure the stability of their funding base. In contrast, foreign banks rely for funding on shorter-term deposits and on resources from their headquarters abroad, thereby enhancing their ability to reprice liabilities faster than the Panamanian- headquartered banks. Overall lending rates (less than one year) in the system fell by only 85 basis points, compared with the 475 basis points fall in the U.S. prime rates (six month) during the period, with the fall again more pronounced in foreign banks. The modest adjustment in lending rates reflects the increased riskiness of the operating environment for the banks (as a result of the economic slowdown), as well as the need to build up loan loss reserves by end-year in compliance with the new Loan Classification and Provisioning Agreement.

The Financial Action Task Force removed Panama from its list of noncooperating countries and territories in June 200 1, after reviewing Panama’s improvements in anti-money laundering regulations. The legislative system is also compliant with recent anti-terrorism initiatives of the United Nations. The Superintendency also completed consolidated inspections of all general and international licensed banks. In April 2002, Panama was removed from the OECD list of noncooperative countries relating to harmful tax practices. 17. Progress in other structural reforms has been limited (see Table 1). The external audit of the Agricultural Development Bank, which started in December 2000 was finalized in the first half of 2001. In the second quarter of 2001, under the direction of the UNDP, a national forum, consisting of representatives from government, labor, and employers, was formed to make recommendations for the reform of the social security system. However, after a year of discussions the forum is deadlocked on what direction to take on pension reform. A new law, outlining the reform of the state-owned water and sewerage company, IDAAN, was passed in October 2001. The new director of the company has begun to implement procedures to reduce the delinquency rates in customer payments and the company has been allocated funds to make much needed capital improvements. III. POLICY Drscussro~s 18. Discussions between the staff and the authorities centered around the economic outlook for 2002; the stance of fiscal policy in the near and medium term; the government’s strategy to raise economic growth in the medium term; and the ongoing structural reform program, including the authorities’ plans to further strengthen the financial system. 19. The staff projects that real GDP growth will rise to 1.2 percent in 2002, the same as in the authorities’ program but slightly below the consensus forecast of private sector analysts. The staff projection is based on the expected recovery of the U.S. economy, and a consequent expansion in exports of goods and services. Also, lower average interest rates and oil prices, higher public sector infrastructure spending, and an end to the negative inventory adjustment in the retail and wholesale trade sectors should contribute to a small increase in domestic demand. Inflation is expected to remain low, at about 0.8 percent. The external current account deficit is projected to narrow further to 4.5 percent of GDP mainly as a result of the growth of net exports in the context of continuing weakness in domestic demand. A. Fiscal Policy 20. The authorities agreed that the pursuit of a sound, prudent fiscal policy and a decline in the public debt ratio are crucial to reducing Panama’s country risk, increasing investor confidence, and bringing about a further general lowering of domestic interest rates. In reviewing the fiscal developments of 2001, they concluded that despite failing to achieve the original zero fiscal deficit target of the Fund program, they had Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- nevertheless demonstrated their strong commitment to fiscal discipline in containing the fiscal deficit of the NFPS to 2.5 percent of GDP, or 1.5 percent of GDP, according to methodology used by the Panamanian authorities (see Box 3). 21. They pointed out that the zero deficit target had been based on an assumption of 4 percent real GDP growth and the adoption of tax measures equivalent to 1.1 percent of GDP, neither of which materialized. Nevertheless, in the face of the slowdown in economic activity the central government had refrained from a countercyclical increase in spending. At the level of the nonfinancial public sector the increase in spending was, in large part, attributable to cyclical pressures on social security benefits. 22. The staff agreed that automatic stabilizers should operate and that the authorities had indeed shown restraint in spending. However, it noted that the increase in the deficit was only partially explained by cyclical factors, as the structural deficit had increased from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2000 to 2.4 percent in 2001, implying a fiscal impulse of 1.5 (see Figure 4). 23. For 2002, on the basis of current policies, the staff estimates that the fiscal deficit would increase slightly to 2.7 percent of GDP.” The central government’s deficit would be virtually unchanged at 3.0 percent of GDP. Revenue would decline slightly as a result of lower dividend earnings from the Banco National and other former public enterprises (in which the government retains a minority share). Current spending would decline by % a percent of GDP, mainly as a result of further reductions in outlays on goods and services and transfers to the rest of the public sector. The government plans to restrict new appointments and adopt other measures (such as reductions in representation and other allowances) to offset the automatic increases in the wage bill. The contraction in noninterest current spending of 1 percent of GDP would offset an increase of ‘/z percent in interest payments, resulting from a higher stock of external debt and a large increase in scheduled Brady Bond interest payments. Capital spending in 2002 will rise slightly but will be dominated by the projects scheduled to funded by the FFD and the sale of reverted area assets. The social security surplus is projected to almost disappear in 2002 as a result of the continued weakness in the economy and the structural widening of the gap between contributions and benefits. 24. The authorities’ fiscal deficit target for the NFPS in 2002 is 2% percent of GDP (or 1% percent of GDP using their methodology), the same as in 2001. No tax measures were being contemplated but, like last year, the government would monitor fiscal developments during the year and implement expenditure cuts as necessary, mainly in goods l5 This figure would correspond to a deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP under the authorities’ methodology, which would be in line with the requirements of the new fiscal responsibility law.

Panama: Differences in Fiscal Accounting Between the Staff and the Authorities The difference in reporting of the fiscal deficit between the staff and the authorities lies in the different accounting treatment of the proceeds from the assets of the Fiduciary Fund for Development (FFD), whose source is the revenue from the privatization of public enterprises. For 2001, the staff considers only the actual interest earnings from the investment of the FFD assets as revenue for the government. Therefore, the staff included US’S80 million as actual 2001 earnings of the FFD and considered only this amount as government revenue. Since the FFD transferred USS200 million to the government in 200 1, the staff treats the remaining US$l20 million as a financing item. The Panamanian government considers both the actual and advanced interest earnings that have been transferred to the government as government revenue. According to a change in the FFD law in 2000, the total programmed earnings of the FFD for the 2001-2004 period should be distributed across the four years in a front-loaded manner but in a such a way that the FFD’s capital is not eroded. Thus, the authorities treat the whole amount of US$200 million as current revenue. The new FFD and Fiscal Responsibility Law that was passed in May 2002 approves the transfer of up to USS200 million of the capital of the FFD to fund four specific public investment projects. The staff has treated this as a financing item-US$lOO million in both 2002 and 2003. On the other hand, the authorities are treating these transfers as revenue “above the line”. They argue that the staffs methodology may give the false impression that the government increases its indebtedness to finance certain investments although part or the whole of financing comes from resources belonging to the government. Moreover, they are concerned that the staffs methodology penalizes the use of privatization revenue to fund certain infrastructure projects, which simply entail converting financial assets into real assets. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- and services or a slower execution of the capital spending program, to ensure that the target was met. The gross financing requirement for 2002 is projected to be about US$l billion. Of this amount US$344 million was prefunded by the end of 2001, and US$177 million was raised in a small global issue in January 2002, allowing the government to comfortably meet its global bond amortization payment in February. The Minister did not expect to encounter any problems in securing the funding to cover the remainder of the government’s projected financing needs for 2002. 25. The Minister of Finance was confident that the new fiscal responsibility law and FFD would put the public finances on a path toward medium-term fiscal sustainability and institutionalize fiscal discipline. He stated that future budgets would have to reflect the new fiscal constraints, thus making it a more transparent and realistic indicator of the government’s fiscal policy than it had tended to be in the past. He added that although the government was not successful in getting approval of its original proposal to use the assets of the FFD to buy back and retire Brady bond debt, the new FFD law would effectively achieve the same objective of ensuring that the fund assets were used to reduce public indebtedness. 26. The staff recommended that the government be more transparent in its dissemination of fiscal information, suggesting that data should be released on a monthly basis and that there should be a formal mid-year review, at which time the Minister of Finance would assess fiscal performance relative to the budget and explain any new measures that had been or would be implemented to ensure the fiscal program remained on track. 27. The staff agreed that the establishment of legal ceilings on public debt and the fiscal deficit was a significant development but emphasized that the authorities would now have to change expenditure and revenue policies to make them consistent with these rules. Without such changes, the credibility of the fiscal rules would be jeopardized. Moreover, as illustrated in the discussion of the medium-term outlook below, the authorities would be forced into expenditure cuts that would have an adverse effect on economic growth. 28. As an example, the staff cited certain special laws, which provided for automatic salary and grade increases for various civil servants, and which in 2002, are estimated to increase the wage bill by 0.2 percent of GDP. Other factors putting pressure on the public finances were structural weaknesses in the tax and social security systems (see below). The Minister mentioned that the government was in the process of drafting a new general law on civil service wages that would do away with the automatic salary adjustments, and instead place annual ceilings on salary adjustments that were linked to changes in government revenue. The staff endorsed the objective of the proposed law, which the Minister indicated might be ready by the end of the year. 29. The staff encouraged the authorities to press for the adoption of a revenue enhancing tax reform proposal that they prepared, comprising of the introduction of a minimum corporate income tax; personal income tax relief for lower income earners; the extension of the VAT to services; and the simplification of the tax system through the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - elimination of various low-yield taxes. While it is important for Panama to remain a relatively low tax economy, there is a need to broaden the tax base and eliminate the distortions present in the tax system. With respect to income taxes, the tax burden falls substantially more on personal rather than corporate income, because of a host of incentives and exemptions that are available to corporations (which also creates distortions across different sectors). In the indirect tax system, the value added tax is levied on goods but not on the majority of services. 30. The Minister emphasized that tax reform remained a key part of the government’s fiscal reform plans and that this issue was to be the next one on the agenda of the National Dialogue. Although he acknowledged that it would be difficult to obtain consensus in the National Dialogue for an increase in taxes during the current difficult economic situation, he felt that a consensus could be reached on the content of the tax reform, with an agreement to postpone the date of implementation until the economic recovery was underway. The Minister pointed out that there had been significant improvements in tax administration during the past two years, with technical and financial assistance provided by the Interamerican Center for Tax Administration (CIAT) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). These improvements had allowed the government to collect US$30 million (0.3 percent of GDP) in delinquent taxes as a result of a special program launched in the last quarter of 2001. B. Structural Reforms 31. Panama needs to achieve a higher, sustainable rate of economic growth if the unemployment rate and the incidence of poverty, which stands at 37 percent, are to be substantially reduced. While macroeconomic stability is essential to achieving these objectives, it is not sufficient. To raise productivity and enhance the economy’s ability to cope with exogenous shocks, the staff urged the authorities to accelerate the pace of structural reforms, particularly those that would strengthen the resilience of the economy, improve its competitiveness, and enhance its ability to adapt to a constantly changing global economy. In this regard, the staff discussed with the authorities’ structural reforms in the financial sector and the social security system, as well as their policy initiatives in international trade and competitiveness. Financial Sector 32. The mission commended the work of the Superintendency of Banks, which has resulted in a substantial strengthening of the supervisory and regulatory environment for commercial banks. The mission also congratulated them on their earnest approach to implementing the recommendations of the Module II assessment.i6 It pointed out that a l6 The Module II assessment and recommendations, the Superintendency’s work program, and a progress report updated quarterly, are all published on the Superintendency’s website. (continued.. .) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - healthy financial system plays an important role in promoting economic efficiency and enhancing the resilience of an economy in the face of adverse shocks. For Panama, a major offshore financial center where financial services make up 13 percent of GDP, the importance of having a sound regulatory and supervisory framework as a means of achieving a healthy financial system was underscored.17 33. In line with the recommendations of the Fund, the Superintendency has issued new regulations on corporate governance and licensing requirements and procedures, criteria for granting bank licenses, and drafted new regulations on market risk, external auditors, and nonfinancial investments by banks, mergers, acquisition and share transfers. It has also signed agreements of understanding with 11 countries to facilitate crossborder consolidated supervision. 34. The mission urged the authorities to concentrate their efforts in upgrading the areas where they were found to be out of compliance with Base1 Core Principles. Toward this end, the mission recommended that increasing the effectiveness of supervision be made a priority, especially through strengthening the training of supervisors and upgrading procedures for on-site and off-site inspections. 35. The mission noted that reforms in the nonbank financial system had lagged behind those in the banking system. Incipient efforts in these areas, including upgrading the supervisory capacity of both the Superintendency of Insurance and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI) will need to be followed through in 2002, in order to strengthen the quality of supervision and regulation of nonbank-financial institutions. With technical and financial assistance from the IDB, an effort is underway to overhaul the supervisory and regulatory framework in the insurance sector with a view to: (i) ensuring the independence of the Superintendency of Insurance; (ii) de-coupling the supervisory function from the political cycle; and (iii) bringing the regulatory and legislative framework for the sector in line with international standards, including anti-money laundering. For other financial institutions, legislation has been drafted to bring previously unsupervised institutions-such as factoring and leasing companies, pawn shops and money-transferring institutions-under the supervision of the MCI. Details of the Superintendency’s work program and an overview of the banking system are contained in the Selected Issues paper. l7 For example, assets of banking system amount to US$38 billion at end-2002, almost four times the level of GDP. According to data from the Bank of International Settlements, crossborder claims on Panama amounted to US$34 billion. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - Social Security Reform 36. To enhance the credibility of the authorities’ commitment to a sustainable fiscal policy, they will need to reform the social security system, which is actuarially insolvent. The national forum on social security reform has started to produce preliminary policy recommendations regarding reforms to the health, maternity, workman’s compensation and administrative systems. However, on the matter of pension reform, the forum is deadlocked, far from any agreement on the direction that reform should take. 37. A recent IL0 study painted a bleak picture of Panama’s social security system. According to the study, on current policies, the social security benefits would begin to exceed contributions in 2006, and all reserves would be exhausted by 20 15. The study recommended raising the retirement age from 62 to 65 for men and from 57 to 60 for women, increasing the pension contribution rate and the minimum number of years required for pension benefits, and imposing limitations on the level and structure of offered services. 38. The mission urged the authorities to move quickly to address the structural imbalance between contributions and benefits. The Minister of Finance stressed that the government was committed to return the social security system to a position of financial viability. He stated that within the framework of the national forum, a working group had been formed to review the IL0 report and evaluate its recommendations and thus it was premature to discuss specific policy measures that may be adopted by the government. Trade Policy 39. The overall degree of trade protection in Panama is relatively low. The average (unweighted) tariff rate is 8.6 percent and the country has a rating of 2 (i.e., open) on the IMF’s trade restrictiveness index. Nevertheless, Panama maintains very high tariffs on some agricultural products, reaching almost 300 percent in the case of poultry.‘s The Minister of Finance stated that the high tariffs on agricultural products were in line with the WTO agreement and were scheduled to be gradually reduced. He added that, in any case, in the government’s quest to negotiate free trade agreements (see below), the government would undoubtedly have to agree to substantially reduce these high tariffs. He indicated that, in the interim, the government’s policy was to assist the sector in becoming internationally competitive. Toward this end, the government planned to use funds from the FFD to install/upgrade irrigation systems in some of the key agricultural provinces. 40. The government’s major trade policy objective for 2002 is to conclude bilateral free trade agreements with all Central American countries and Mexico. One had already been concluded with El Salvador and negotiations were currently underway with Costa Rica. I8 See the Trade Policy Annex in the Selected Issues Paper for details on Panama’s trade regime. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - In concluding trade agreements with the rest of Central America, the government hopes to improve its ability to attract foreign investors with a regional focus to establish operations in Panama, where they would be able to benefit from the country’s comparative advantage in banking, telecommunications, ports, and transportation services. As part of this strategy, the government plans to use funds from the FFD to expand the highway connecting Panama to Costa Rica. Improving Competitiveness and Economic Efficiency 41. Based on the evolution of the real effective exchange rate, Panama has not suffered any erosion of competitiveness as a result of using the U.S. dollar as its currency (see Figure 3). In recent years, nontraditional exports have grown strongly, even though traditional exports, most notably banana, have declined. As already mentioned, Panama’s service sector, especially ports, telecommunications, transportation, and banking have expanded substantially, attracting large amounts of foreign direct investment, while the performance of the traditional manufacturing sector has lagged behind. 42. Given these mixed results, the mission recommended that the authorities undertake a comprehensive review of existing laws and regulations with the objective of modifying those statutes that distort the market allocation process and/or have the unintended consequence of discouraging employment and investment. While the staff was unable to assess the seriousness of the problem during the consultation mission, it found that the prevailing view among private and many public sector officials was that economic efficiency was being adversely affected by certain regulations, licensing requirements and laws that discouraged investment and employment or distorted market incentives. In addition, although Panama’s governance indicators have improved over the past decade putting the country above the average for Latin America,” negative perceptions about corruption and weakness of the judicial system are commonly cited as obstacles to higher rates of investment in Panama. 43. The Minister of Finance stated that a major initiative to increase competitiveness and make the country more investor friendly was being undertaken with the assistance of the IDB. A competitiveness project funded by the IDB would design a national competitiveness strategy. In addition, cluster groups, composed of representatives of labor, business, and government, had already been formed for four sectors (agroindustry, tourism, logistics, technical services) to study existing ways to improve investment and competitiveness in each sector. The Minister stated that any changes to labor market or other regulations would thus await the assessments and recommendations coming out of the competitiveness project. The mission urged the authorities not to grant only sector-specific I9 See, for example, the “World Bank Governance Indicators”, and the “International Country Risk Guide” by the Political Risk Services Group. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-26 - exemptions from labor and other regulations that clearly also adversely impacted the rest of the economy. To enhance overall economic efficiency, the damaging regulations should be eliminated for the economy as a whole. IV. MEDIUM-TERMECONOMICOUTLOOK 44. If the authorities are able to adhere to the new fiscal rules by taking the necessary steps to arrest the growth of wages and correct the structural weaknesses in the tax and social security systems, there will be a substantial improvement in the public finances while still allowing room to increase spending on infrastructure investment. In addition, interest rates are likely to fall providing a boost to private investment. If the fiscal measures are supplemented with the implementation of the structural reforms outlined above, the potential rate of economic growth could rise steadily over the medium term, with the expectation that employment growth would be at a rate sufficiently high to bring about a steady reduction in the unemployment rate. 45. The staff has prepared an illustrative medium-term scenario that incorporates these assumptions (Table 2). Real GDP growth is projected to average 3.7 percent a year over the 2003-2007 period (rising gradually to 4% percent a year in 2006), boosted by an increase in public and private investment and strong growth in exports of goods and services. 2o The external current account deficit stabilizes at about 4.3 percent of GDP over the next five years. World interest rates are in line with the current WE0 (e.g., the yield on the U.S. lo-year government bond is assumed to rise from 5.1 percent in 2002 to 6.3 percent in 2007) and the spreads on Panama debt are assumed to fall by 100 basis points by 2004 and remain flat thereafter. The authorities are assumed to target a NFPS of 1 percent of GDP in the medium term, following the completion of the capital projects financed by the FFD. This would give room for automatic stabilizers to operate without breaching the fiscal rules in the event of slower-than-expected economic growth. Gross debt of the NFPS would decline from 75 percent of GDP in 2001 to 62 percent in 2007. A tax reform that boosts revenue by 0.7 percent of GDP is assumed to be implemented in 2003, and a reform of the social security system that gradually improves its finances is assumed to be implemented in 2004, i.e. before the end of the current government’s term of office. 46. The staff’s medium-term balance of payments projections suggests limited external vulnerability. In the period 2003-2007, it is assumed that public external borrowing is undertaken to finance the deficit plus external debt amortization payments. Because external amortization payments are projected to be low during this period-less than US$240 million (2 percent of GDP) in each year, except for 2006 when it jumps to US$740 2o This average annual rate of growth is above the 3.6 percent average for the 1992-2001 period and the 2.9 percent average of the 1997-200 1 period.

Foreign direct investment is projected to average about 4.6 percent of GDP a year for the 2003-2007 period, compared with 7.3 percent of GDP a year during the 1998-2002 period. Largely because of this, the current account deficit is projected to be lower than in recent years. If development projects currently being prepared, such as the expansion of the Panama Canal and the Howard Base multimodal complex, come on stream as hoped by the authorities, foreign direct investment and the current account deficit would likely be substantially higher than in the staffs medium term projections. 48. The medium term projections assume modest gains in external competitiveness. The real effective exchange rate is projected to continue its trend depreciation, while recent and planned new investment in ports, telecommunications, and transportation services further enhances Panama’s comparative advantage in these areas. In addition, the recent structural reforms to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework of Panama’s banking system will reinforce Panama’s comparative advantage in banking services. As a result, both merchandise exports and service exports (including tourism, which has grown strongly in recent years) are assumed to grow faster than GDP in the medium term. 2’ During 1998-2002, government external debt amortization payments averaged US$506 million a year (5.1 percent of GDP) 22 Also working in the authorities’ favor is the fact that if the FFD invests the full amount of its capital in Panama global bonds, as permitted under the new law, foreign investors’ exposure to Panama would decline. As a result, ceteris paribus, new issues of Panama debt would become attractive. 23 No comprehensive data exist on private sector external liabilities to allow for an overall assessment of external vulnerability. Data on crossborder bank lending from the Bank of International Settlements estimate the claims of foreign bank affiliates on Panamanian residents at 40 percent of GDP at end-200 1. However, liabilities of these banks to Panamanian residents was estimated at 33 percent of GDP. No information about the maturity distribution of these claims or the liabilities was available.

The staff prepared an alternative scenario to look at the sensitivity of the baseline projections to more pessimistic assumptions. The key assumptions in this scenario were: (1) annual real GDP growth of 3 percent a year for 2004-2007 (equal to average annual real GDP growth for 1997-2001); (2) no tax reform; (3) no social security reform; and (4) higher interest rates of 100 basis points for the period 2003 to 2007. Under the above assumptions, the deficit of the NFPS would rise to 3.5 percent of GDP, ceteris paribus, by 2007. In such a situation it could be difficult to find alternative budgetary saving to meet the staffs deficit projections of 1 percent of GDP. As has been the practice in the past, the authorities would have to rely most heavily on cuts in capital spending and purchases of goods and services, with obvious adverse implications for public service delivery, public infrastructure development, private investment, and overall economic growth. It should be noted, however, that to comply with the Fiscal Responsibility Law less fiscal adjustment would be required. Only in 2005-2007, would there be an ex ante contravention of the law.24 Alternative Scenario-Impact on Fiscal Accounts (In percent of GDP) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Deficit of the NFPS - baseline 2.7 2.4 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 Deficit of the NFPS - alternative scenario 2.7 3.2 2.0 2.4 3.1 3.5 Lower real GDP growth, 2004-2007 -- -- 0.1 0.2 0.5 0.5 No tax reform -- 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 No social security reform -- -- -- 0.2 0.4 0.6 Higher interest rates by 100 basis points, 2003-2007 -- 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.5 0.7 Gross debt of the NFPS - alternative scenario I/ 74.9 73.7 72.4 71.0 69.6 68.3 l/ Assumes fiscal deficit of NFPS equal to 2 percent of GDP, in accordance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 50. Like other countries in the region, Panama’s economy faced difficult challenges in 2001. The slowdown in global economic activity and banking system credit expansion to more sustainable levels resulted in real GDP growth falling well below that previously envisaged. A fractious political climate and a lack of majority support in the assembly had limited the ability of the government to follow through with its economic policy agenda. Nevertheless, substantial progress was achieved in the reform of bank regulations and supervision and, after an extensive national consultation process, broad political consensus has been achieved on key structural fiscal reforms. 24 Recall that in 2002 and 2003, the deficit would be 1 percent of GDP less according to the authorities’ methodology. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - 51. Economic activity is expected to stage a mild recovery in 2002 based on the expected rebound of the U.S. economy, the initiation of new government infrastructure projects, and an end to the negative inventory adjustment in the retail and wholesale trade sectors. Inflation is expected to remain low, at about 1% percent. 52. The pursuit of a sound prudent fiscal policy and lowering the public debt ratio are crucial to Panama’s medium term macroeconomic stability, a reduction in vulnerability, and an increase in potential output growth. In 2001, despite the central government’s success in keeping a tight rein on spending, most fiscal indicators worsened, as the structural deficit and the net debt of the nonfinancial public sector both increased. 53. In 2002 and beyond, fiscal policy will be governed by the new fiscal responsibility law, which imposes a ceiling for the fiscal deficit and requires the annual growth of net debt to be less than that of nominal GDP. The staff believes that the new law provides an appropriate framework to institutionalize fiscal discipline and achieve medium-term fiscal sustainability. It can also enhance fiscal transparency and, unlike in current practice, make future budgets more realistic instruments of the government’s fiscal policy. 54. However, while the establishment of legal ceilings on public debt and the fiscal deficit are significant developments, the authorities now need to change expenditure and revenue policies to make them consistent with these rules. In this regard, there will be a need to review civil service regulations, especially the special laws that generate substantial automatic increases in the wage bill each year. 55. It will also be important for the authorities to press ahead with their revenue- enhancing tax reform proposal in order to stop the decline in the tax to GDP ratio experienced in recent years. Given that this type of reform generally takes time to obtain legislative approval, it would be desirable to start the process as soon as possible and not wait until an economic recovery is underway. There is a need to broaden the tax base and eliminate some severe distortions present in the tax system. With respect to income taxes, the tax burden falls substantially more on personal rather than corporate income, because of a host of incentives and exemptions that are available to corporations. In the indirect tax system, the value added tax is levied on goods but not on the majority of services. 56. A reform of the social security system will be key to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability and compliance with the new fiscal rules. The system is actuarially insolvent and the existing imbalance between payroll contributions and program benefits is projected to widen rapidly. Policy makers and members of the national forum responsible for reforming the system should accept as soon as possible that some combination of reduced program benefits/services, higher retirement age, and higher contribution rates will have to be a part of the solution to restore financial viability to the system. 57. In the absence of the civil service, tax, and social security system reforms cited above, the credibility of the net debt and deficit ceilings would be jeopardized. To satisfy Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3o- the annual deficit limits would require cuts to capital spending and purchases of goods and services that would likely have adverse effects on public service delivery, private investment, and overall economic growth. 58. Overall, the banking sector appears sound, profitable and has been robust enough to withstand the current economic slowdown. The authorities should be commended for the progress made thus far in strengthening the supervisory and regulatory environment for commercial banks, and moving earnestly to implement the recommendations of the 2001 Fund Module II Assessment mission. The staff urges the authorities to concentrate resources on upgrading procedures for onsite and offsite inspections and strengthening the training of supervisors, one of just two areas (out of a total of 25) where the Superintendency of Banks was found not to be compliant with Base1 Core Principles. The authorities have moved aggressively to strengthen anti-money laundering regulations. 59. Reforms in the nonbank financial system have lagged behind those in the banking system. It is expected that, under the existing financial and technical assistance program with the IDB, it will be possible to accelerate the pace of reforms in these areas. These would include the upgrading of the supervisory capacity of both the Superintendency of Insurance and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in order to strengthen the quality of supervision and regulation of nonbank-financial institutions. 60. The authorities are encouraged to undertake a comprehensive review of existing laws and regulations with the objective of modifying those that distort the market allocation process and/or have the unintended consequence of discouraging employment and investment. It is expected that the Competitiveness Project with the IDB will identify and propose remedies to such problems. It would be important that the authorities act quickly to eliminate for the economy as a whole, and not just on a sector- specific basis, those regulations and laws that are found to create economy-wide distortions. 61. Panama’s economic and financial statistics are generally adequate for surveillance and program purposes. Nevertheless, important shortcomings in the coverage, reliability, and timeliness of economic statistics remain, which the authorities are addressing with technical assistance from the World Bank. The authorities are urged to being disseminating monthly fiscal data and to implement the Fund’s 200 1 GFS Manual methodology. 62. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 12-month schedule.

These procedures required a review of the BNP’s external audit mechanism to determine whether the BNP publishes annual financial statements that are independently audited in accordance with internationally accepted standards. The assessment was completed on July 12, 2001 and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - APPENDIX I concluded that the BNP’s external audit mechanism at the time of the assessment was adequate. B. Nonfinancial Relations VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement: Panama uses the U.S. dollar as the primary means of payment in the local economy. Its national currency (Balboa) is issued in the form of coins only and serves as a unit of account. The exchange rate of the Balboa is fixed at B 1 per U.S. dollar. Panama has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. IX. Last Article IV Consultation: The 2001 Article IV consultation was concluded on January 22,200l. Panama is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. X. Technical Assistance: a. FAD: A mission visited Panama in April and November 1992 to identify areas to improve financial reporting and public expenditure control. In December 1996 a mission visited Panama to advise the authorities on procedures to improve budget monitoring. b. MAE: A consultant visited Panama in April 1996 to advise the authorities on domestic public debt management. Follow-up assistance was provided in April 1997. In May 2001, a mission visited Panama to review compliance with the Base1 Core Principles under Module 2 of the Fund’s offshore Financial Sector Initiative. C. STA: A mission visited Panama in May 1992 to improve balance of payments statistics. In April 1996 a staff member of STA temporarily joined the Article IV/UFR mission to resolve methodological issues in the compilation of Panama’s national accounts; follow-up technical assistance was provided in July 1997. A mission reviewed the methodology of the compilation of the balance of payments in September 1996. In July 1997 a long-term advisor began to work with the authorities on further improvements in balance of payments and debt statistics and completed this assignment in early 1999. The authorities published revised balance of payments data for 1989-98 in March 1999. In May 1999 a mission visited Panama to assist in the preparation of metadata. In April 200 1, a STA expert visited Panama to provide assistance on a number of issues relating to the compilation of the natural accounts, including the implementation of the 1993 SNA. XI.

Key information on the financing of the budget is transmitted to the Fund with a lag of six to eight weeks. The authorities began to publish an advance release calendar of their economic statistics in April 1998. In addition, they have begun to implement an improved revision policy that allows for periodic revisions of economic statistics based on improved source data and methods. Significant improvements have been made to the national accounts and the balance of payments, and programs have been initiated to improve government finance statistics through the implementation of a new integrated financial administration system (SIAFPA). The Superintendence of Banks is reviewing data collection and processing of monetary statistics and has begun to disseminate data on its web page. In addition, in 2001 an IMF consultant has helped the authorities in developing a methodology to incorporate the Canal and reverted Canal areas into the national accounts and the balance of payments. Real sector a. Current status: The authorities have broadened the coverage of the national accounts statistics and improved the methodology of compilation. The accounts now include resident banks and enterprises operating in the Colon Free Zone (ZLC) by strictly applying the residency criterion of the balance of payments and national accounts recommendations. Financial services are now properly allocated to users, including exports. Constant price series were revised to reflect 1982 weights (the previous series used 1970) and the data were harmonized with the balance of payments. The revised data are available for the period 1980-2000. A new quarterly GDP series began to be produced in 200 1 with reference estimates going back to 2000. The weights underlying the consumer price index (CPI) were derived from a household budget survey conducted in 1983/84. Consumer price data are available through August 200 1. b. Pending issues: National accounts technical assistance missions in 1996 and 1997 noted problems in the methodology used to compile value-added for financial services and in the source data used to measure transactions involving enterprises in the ZLC. In addition, the development of a supply-use framework was recommended. As noted above, the authorities are continuing work in these areas and are making progress on financial services and coverage of the Colon Free Zone. Despite recent improvements, preliminary estimates of real GDP volume remain unreliable and untimely, in part because of delays in data collection and the lack of skilled national accountants in the statistical unit. In addition, the Directorate of Statistics has just initiated an effort to update the base year for the national accounts from 1982 to 1996. This new version should be released sometime in 2002. C. Technical assistance: The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean is supporting the development of a supply-use table. A national accounts mission from the Fund’s Statistics Department visited Panama in FY 2001 to assist with the improvement of the national accounts statistics.

Current status: Data on central government finances are provided on a cash and an accrual basis. Data on the public enterprises and agencies are compiled only on a cash basis. Monthly and quarterly data for the operations of the budgetary central government are currently available through March 2002. b. Pending issues: Monitoring of public sector financial developments would be facilitated if data on public enterprises and agencies were provided on an accrual basis and were more timely, if the consistency of information on intrapublic sector transfers were improved, and if the coverage of the investment program were made complete. The authorities have recently begun to compile the finances of the public sector on a consolidated basis and to reconcile the public sector balance with its financing. The implementation of a more centralized and complete data collection system (SIAFPA) is currently ongoing and began, during the preparation of the 1999 Budget, with the coverage of central government expenditures. A new Director of SIAFPA was appointed in the Ministry of Economy and Finance in December 1999. The recently established Treasurer’s function in the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the electronic linkage of all public sector entities, when fully operational, is expected to improve the timeliness of public finance statistics. In addition to broadening SIAFPA’s scope of coverage, there is a need to address the issue of unrecorded expenditures, which have resulted in persistent and significant discrepancies in the measurement of fiscal performance from above and below the line. In this regard, the authorities have indicated that they could seek additional technical assistance with public expenditure management and in the operation of some Treasury functions from the Fund. C. Technical assistance: The authorities have requested technical assistance from the Fund on the GFSM 2001 methodology. Additionally, related training could be provided during the six-week course to be offered at Headquarters during March-April 2003. Monetary accounts a. Current status: Provision of data by the monetary authorities has been regular and reasonably current. These data are available through March 2002. Data on the operations of the commercial banks are prepared by the Superintendence of Banks with a lag of one to two months, although they are reported for publication in IFS with somewhat longer lags (December 2001). Problems concerning information on private banks’ holdings of government securities are being addressed. b. Pending issues: Corrections to ClassiIications, following privatizations occur with a lag in the accounts of the Banco National de Panama. There are no consistent data prepared on the financial positions of the National Mortgage Bank and the Agricultural Development Bank. C. Technical assistance: The new Superintendency of Banks may require technical assistance to improve data collection and compilation procedures in the medium term.

Current status: An STA technical assistance mission in September 1996 identified problems in compilation procedures and systems, including misclassification of external debt transactions, untimely collection of data, and poor quality control procedures, and recommended a long-term technical assistance program to address these issues. To implement this program, a series of technical assistance missions took place in July 1997, October-December 1997, and April-June 1998. This technical assistance has led to significant improvements in the quality and timeliness of external sector statistics, including through periodic reconciliation of external debt statistics discrepancies with multilateral lenders. International Investment Position data for 1995-01 are now compiled, and the balance of payments statistics are mostly prepared according to the guidelines of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPMS) and are now available quarterly with a three-month lag. The most recent data on balance of payments statistics pertains to December 2001. b. Pending issues: Technical assistance has led to statistical revisions for the 1989-98 balance of payments, particularly regarding data on foreign direct investment. Although the methodology has been developed, transactions related to the transfer of the Canal and the Canal Area have only been partially recorded because of asset valuation problems. Also, data are not yet available on nonfinancial private sector debt or on transactions involving financial derivatives. C. Technical assistance: STA began a long-term technical assistance program in July 1997 to improve the balance of payments and external debt statistics. In preparation for this program the authorities provided additional budgetary and human resources to deal with administrative problems and the lack of adequate data processing equipment in the Balance of Payments Section of the Directorate of Statistics and Census. The Advisor, who visited Panama twice in 1997 and once in 1998, completed his assignment in early 1999, and the authorities published revised balance of payments data for 1989-98 in March 1999. In 2001 an IMF consultant has helped the authorities in developing a methodology to incorporate the transactions related to the Canal and reverted Canal areas into the balance of payments statistics. The authorities intend to incorporate, at a later stage, these transactions simultaneously in the national accounts and the balance of payments to ensure consistency.
