Deppler and Susan Schadler January 24, 1996 I. Introduction A staff team comprising C.M. Watson, F. Lakwijk, J. Levy, B. Turtelboom, and S. Salimi as assistant (all Eul), visited Brussels from November 10 to 20, 1995, to conduct Article IV consultation discussions. The mission met with the Governor of the National Bank (NBB), three of the four Vice Prime Ministers (responsible for Finance, the Budget, and the Economy, respectively), officials of the NBB and the ministries concerned with economic and social affairs, and representatives of employers' and labor union federations. Mr. Kiekens, Executive Director, and Mr. Daco, Assistant to the Executive Director, participated in the meetings. The previous consultation was concluded on December 16, 1994 (EBM/94/111). Directors stressed that significant additional measures were needed to meet the authorities' fiscal deficit target for 1996, that a tight fiscal stance should also be maintained over the medium term, and that adjustment should take the form of structural expenditure-reducing measures. They urged that the contributions of the Regions and Communities to this adjustment be strengthened. Some Directors expressed concern about the role of wage indexation and encouraged movement to a more flexible bargaining mechanism. Directors agreed that the hard currency policy made prompt action to resolve the major structural problems in the public finances and the labor market all the more necessary. The elections in May 1995 at the federal, regional and community (language-based) levels were the first under the revised constitution, which made Belgium a full-fledged federal state. The federal centre-left coalition of four parties headed by Mr. Dehaene remains in office, with the main ministers retaining their portfolios. L/ u The four parties in the coalition are Flemish and Walloon Christian Democrats and Socialists. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 2 - II. Backqround to the Discussions In 1995, GDP growth is estimated to have been unchanged from 1994, at 2.2 percent (Chart 1, Appendix I). A significant slowdown occurred in the course of the year, as foreign demand faltered: the contribution of net exports to growth fell by l/2 of a percentage point of GDP to l/4 percent of GDP. JJ Disposable household income remained subdued, following the introduction of a two-year real wage freeze; private consumption continued to grow relatively slowly, supported by a further reduction in the household saving rate. One factor underlying the slow growth in domestic consumption has been the unavoidable need to rein back the fiscal deficit. However, capacity utilization in manufacturing reached a near-record level early in the year--before slipping subsequently--and business investment rose sharply. Employment began to recover, after falling for three years; but the rate of unemployment continued to climb. u Unit labor costs again were unchanged, and consumer price inflation declined to 1 l/2 percent as the exchange rate appreciated (Chart 2). The current account surplus of the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) rose slightly to 5 3/4 percent-of GDP, with a decline in private saving--particularly among households--being offset by an increase in public saving (Chart 3). For 1996, the staff anticipates a recovery during the course of the year, although year-on-year growth is projected to be only on the order of 1 l/2 percent-- reflecting developments in key trading partners. A modest slackening of domestic demand is projected, and the GDP forecast is particularly sensitive to the timing of a recovery in import demand in neighboring countries. u The medium-term economic outlook similarly depends on growth in European and other export markets. With non-oil imports of trading partners growing by more than 5 percent a year in the next few years, as in the most recent WEO, this outlook would be favorable-- assuming progress in tackling structural rigidities in the Belgian economy that assures an ability to respond adequately to rising foreign demand. Financial policies in recent years have been geared to the objective of maintaining a tight link with the Deutsche Mark and, latterly, achieving first-round participation in final stage of European Monetary Union (EMU). Following a sharp decline against the DM in August 1993, the Belgian franc returned to a position very close to its central rate in early 1994 (Chart 4). In March 1995, with national elections approaching and the French currency under pressure, a slight weakening of the Belgian franc prompted the National Bank to raise official interest rates, and the short- term market interest rate differential vis-a-vis Germany widened to some u GDP (at quarterly rates) rose by 0.8 percent in the first quarter, fell by 0.3 percent in the second, and in the last two quarters was flat. 2/ The favorable two-point unemployment rate differential vis-8-vis the European Union observed in 1992-93 was virtually eliminated in 1994-95. J/ Exports are equal to 70 percent of GDP; two thirds of merchandise exports are to France, Germany, and the Netherlands.

Subsequently, the exchange rate strengthened, and official rates returned to German levels by mid-May. Since then, the main intervention rate has mirrored the fall in the German repo rate. The short- term interest rate differential vis-a-vis Germany is now negligible; the long-term differential has declined, and has recently been moving in a range of some 45 to 65 basis points-- among the lowest differentials vis-a-vis Germany in the EU, despite Belgium's high public debt ratio (Chart 5). Fiscal policy, since 1992, has been directed toward cutting the general government deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 1996 (as per Belgium's EMU "convergence plan") and reducing the public debt burden in the direction of 60 percent of GDP, as specified by the Maastricht Treaty. In late 1993 a new adjustment program was introduced, comprising additional taxes and structural expenditure measures. JJ On balance, the adjustment efforts of 1992-94 consisted of revenue measures: the ratio of revenues to GDP rose by 2 percentage points over this period. However, on the expenditure side, a rising trend in general government primary expenditure (which increased by 2 l/4 percentage points of GDP during 1990-93) was finally checked from 1994, as the coverage of specific spending norms was expanded, and increasingly observed (Chart 6). 2J In 1995, there was a further decline in expenditure, although this largely reflected a sharp reduction in interest expenses, following long-term debt refinancing in early 1994. This more than offset a modest decline in the ratio of revenue to GDP, which reflected relatively low growth in higher-taxed income and expenditures. As a consequence of these developments, substantial progress in fiscal consolidation was achieved in 1994 and 1995: the deficit was cut by 1 l/2 percentage points to 5 l/4 percent of GDP in 1994, and is estimated to have declined by a further 3/4 points to 4 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995. With lower deficits and economic recovery, the public debt ratio fell from a peak of 138 percent of GDP in 1993 to 135 percent in 1995--remaining, however, the highest relative to GDP in the EU (Chart 7). Assessment of economic developments has not been materially hampered by weaknesses in data; however, the system has fallen behind standards in some other industrial countries. In 1994, a major initiative was taken in this area, with the setting up of the National Accounts Institute (see Appendix III). Work is also underway on preparing estimates of the external current account for Belgium (as opposed to the BLEU). 1/ See SM/94/286, page 2. 2J These norms specify no real growth in primary expenditures by the federal government (excluding social security), and real growth of no more than 1 l/2 percent annually in public health care expenditures.

Policy Discussions With the credibility of monetary policy increasingly well-established, the consultation discussions centered on the design of measures to achieve a continuing and decisive reduction in the public debt ratio and to foster fuller employment. Thus, the predominant issue was how to design a fiscal reform package that would credibly maintain the deficit on a declining trend, while being broadly acceptable to the population and friendly to employment. A second issue was the need to improve incentives for labor market participation through reform of the system of wage determination and of regulations affecting the labor market. Taken together, the impact on the labor market of appropriate changes in fiscal provisions, the bargaining system, and the regulatory framework could offer an opportunity to break out of a situation in which there has been no net employment creation for a quarter of a century. A further issue covered in the discussions was the nature and implications of changes underway in the financial sector. A major theme in the discussions was the authorities' objective of achieving first-round participation in EMU-- a priority which the staff fully endorses. An important question, in each of the main policy areas, was how the design of reforms might affect private saving and investment behavior, and hence the medium-term outlook for growth, employment, and the balance of payments. In terms of policy approach, a significant issue was the authorities' concern to develop reform initiatives which, while building on the existing social consensus in Belgium, would underpin policy credibility and sharpen incentives for efficiency in the economy--changes in the policy framework that could thus help foster a virtuous circle in terms of market expectations and economic performance. 1. Monetarv nolicv The credibility of the hard currency policy is now increasingly well established, as evidenced by the narrowing of interest differentials. The authorities and bankers ascribed this to the approach--adopted in 1990--of gearing policy strictly to a tight exchange rate link with the DM. It is recognized that the BNB has enjoyed the Government's full support in adjusting interest rates as necessary to defend the exchange rate-- independently of the objective of first-round participation in the final stage of EMU. More broadly, discussions with the authorities, employers, and labor unions confirmed that the hard currency policy has attained a very substantial degree of acceptance and legitimacy. The fruits of this policy have become tangible for the Government, as Belgium has benefitted fully from the recent decline in international interest rates. For employers, the more stable financial environment is welcome --and economic growth is seen as responsive to underlying developments in partner country economies and competitiveness, rather than shifts in domestic monetary policy. For labor union leadership, the imperative of European integration is accepted, including the implications for monetary policy of the commitment to EMU.

The staff asked the authorities and bankers what domestic developments could potentially disturb the credibility of the monetary authorities in financial markets. Unemployment has not been seen as a material threat to credibility-- reflecting in part, perhaps, the generous social benefits available, as well as the perception that monetary policy is not the tool with which to address unemployment in Belgium. Uniformly, the risk factor cited was any perceived back-tracking by the Government on its commitment to restore the health of the public finances. Market expectations appear to incorporate continuing resolve by the Government in pressing forward decisively with fiscal consolidation, which was viewed as crucial-- particularly in view of uncertainties about market behavior in the run-up to EMU. 2. Fiscal oolicv The authorities' budget for 1996 aims to reduce the general government deficit by a further 1 l/2 percentage points to 3 percent of GDP, and thus achieve a long-standing objective of the authorities. At the federal level, including social security, measures amounting to almost 1 l/2 percent of GDP are to be implemented in 1996. JJ The Regions and Communities, including local authorities, have also committed themselves to further fiscal consolidation in 1996, in accordance with understandings reached earlier with the Federal Government. 2J The measures in the 1996 federal budget are spread over a range of revenue and expenditure items. Revenue measures amount to nearly 1 percent of GDP and include the sale of mobile phone licenses and buildings, an increase in the normal VAT rate from 20.5 percent to 21 percent, continued suspension of the indexation of tax brackets, an increase in the tax on diesel car registration, a surcharge on workers' social security contributions, and a rise in the interest withholding tax from 13.39 to 15 percent. Expenditure measures total more than l/2 percent of GDP, and consist of reductions in subsidies to public enterprises and in departmental operating costs, a continued nominal freeze of defense spending, cut-backs in health care, and tighter application of unemployment benefits. u The baseline forecast for the general government in 1996 (i.e., on unchanged policies) includes a further decline in interest payments in excess of l/4 of a percentage point of GDP, but also a revenue loss of more than l/4 of a percentage point of GDP on account of the pattern of income and expenditure growth. Given the 1996 budget objective, the ratio of revenue to GDP is likely to increase overall by close to l/2 percent of GDP. 2/ In 1995, the deficit at the federal level (including social security) is estimated at 3.9 percent, and at the level of the Regions and Communities (including local authorities) at 0.5 percent. For a discussion of fiscal federalism in Belgium see SM/94/289. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - The authorities confirmed that this package includes once-off measures amounting to l/2 percent of GDP, which should ideally be replaced in 1997 by measures with a lasting effect. During the consultation discussions, the staff indicated that a general government deficit of 3 percent of GDP in 1996 should be attainable on the basis of the announced measures, provided that GDP growth did not slip significantly below the rate of 2 percent then projected by the staff, u and that the Regions and Communities adhered reasonably closely to their deficit target. In this connection, meetings were held with ministers and senior officials of the Regions and Communities, who expressed strong commitment to agreed fiscal objectives. The federal authorities, for their part, indicated that they would take any measures necessary to ensure achievement of the deficit goal in 1996--for example, should this be threatened by a weakening of economic growth. The staff welcomed strongly the authorities' commitment to ensure that a 3 percent deficit would be achieved--attaining the longstanding government goal for 1996 as well as the flow objective under the Maastricht Treaty criteria. Since the consultation discussions, the prospects for economic growth in 1996 have weakened to some 1 l/2 percent. Thus, some additional fiscal measures--probably on the order of l/4 percent of GDP--will need to be taken to ensure attainment of the deficit objective for 1996; it would be desirable to achieve this through expenditure measures with a lasting impact. Attainment of a 3 percent deficit in 1996, while most important, is only one element in the implementation of fiscal consolidation in Belgium. Key issues that remain to be addressed include the replacement with permanent measures of once-off elements in the 1996 budget, and reforms that would maintain Belgium's very high public debt ratio on a decisively declining long-term trend. In the absence of further reforms, the structural primary surplus would trend downward over the coming years and especially over the long-term--reflecting, inter alia, demographic developments and rising health care costs. Thus, a fiscal consolidation plan needs to be based on a reform of public expenditure policies. The authorities and the staff identified three critical structural problems in nublic exDenditure: 0 In the 1980's, health care costs began to grow more rapidly than GDP. Since 1993, the Government has been successful in slowing the growth rate of such spending. However, the structural reforms already taken (such as increases in co-payments) need to be complemented by further measures to restrain the underlying rate of growth in spending in the future, due to demographic pressures and cost increases. I/ The federal budget was in fact constructed on the basis of a 1996 growth rate of 2.2 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - a Spending on unemployment benefits is not expected to grow substantially relative to GDP over the medium and long term but some savings in this area appear possible and desirable. In particular, a structural problem arises from the narrow differential between the level of net unemployment benefits versus the net minimum wage for lower-paid workers, which fails to encourage participation in the labor force. lJ A further problem has been the generous provision of early retirement schemes to soften the social impact of redundancy in declining industries; as a result the labor force participation rate for workers aged 50 to 64 is only 35 percent-- some 10 to 20 points below the level in neighboring countries. 0 Finally, without reforms, expenditure on pensions, while fairly stable relative to GDP over the next few years, would increase significantly in the long term-- from approximately 9 percent of GDP in 1995 to a peak of some 15 percent of GDP in the early decades of the next century. This trend reflects demographic influences on a scale typical of other industrial countries; a supplementary factor in Belgium is the indexation of civil service pensions to wages (not prices). 2J The authorities confirmed that there is a strong consensus in the governing coalition to address these structural fiscal problems now, in order to put the public finances on a sound long-term footing (thus reducing the vulnerability of economic performance to problems of confidence) and, more specifically, to ensure that the public debt is maintained on a firmly declining trend toward 60 percent of GDP--viewed as a high priority in the context of Belgium's concern to be a first round participant in the final stage of EMU. In this connection, the authorities provided the staff with the May 1995.report of the Conseil Superieur des Finances (CSF), which sets out a stratezv for reducing the Public debt ratio over the medium term, and is a key point of reference for the fiscal strategy pursued by the government. 3J This report emphasized that it would be crucial--following attainment of the 3 percent deficit target in 1996--to maintain the primary lJ The incentive to take up employment is low for those receiving the "minimum welfare benefit" --who generally face a marginal effective tax rate of 100 percent--as well as for certain recipients of unemployment benefits; older unemployed persons can face marginal tax rates of around 75 percent, and one-parent families of up to 70 percent, to give but two examples. u The projections cited here were provided by the Planning Bureau. The nature and time-horizon of the key structural expenditure problems were agreed to be fairly clear, albeit the scale of the problems is inevitably highly sensitive to projection assumptions. For a discussion of the sensitivity of the pension projections, see the background paper. 3J The CSF is an official economic research body, whose Board includes senior economic policy-makers, which has been charged with formulating recommendations for short- and medium-term fiscal targets covering the main components of the general government. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - fiscal surplus at the implied level of at least 6 percent of GDP during the following years, in order to achieve a credible reduction in the public debt ratio. JJ A further recommendation of the CSF is that, over time, it would be most important to avoid slippage in fiscal consolidation as a result of fluctuations in the business cycle-- which implies taking advantage of upswings in economic growth to ensure adequate debt reduction. The staff estimates that adherence to the CSF approach during 1997-2000 would reduce the fiscal deficit from 3 to under 1 l/2 percent of GDP, over this period. The public debt ratio would decline by some 16 percentage points to below 120 percent of GDP in the year 2000 (Chart 8). 2/ The staff expressed the view that the objectives set out in the CSF report appeared broadly appropriate, irrespective of the Maastricht framework. Three points are worth noting. First, in terms of political economy, the approach of focusing in the period ahead on a simple goal of at least 6 percent for the primary surplus would appear persuasive--Belgium has a well-established record of using such clear nominal goals as a catalyst for social consensus and a means of developing credibility. Second, credibility established now would carry the additional benefit of allowing some degree of flexibility in the operation of the automatic stabilizers subsequently, should cyclical developments give rise to compelling arguments for that. Third, while the goal of reducing the debt ratio rightly commands a very high priority, it is also important to achieve this with measures that remove fiscal distortions that may be impairing economic performance. Notably, in light of the already very high share of revenues in GDP (Chart 9, upper panel) the staff recommended that further fiscal adjustment toward the CSF goals should be achieved essentially by expenditure-reducing measures; in particular, it was crucial to abstain from measures that would entail any increase in the "tax wedge" in the labor market (Chart 9, lower panel). As regards the "use" of the resources freed by expenditure cuts, the policy trade-offs in Belgium over the next few years, in the view of the staff, clearly favor deficit and debt reduction over cuts in revenues relative to GDP--desirable as such cuts would be in their own right. However, importantly, it would be most advantageous to achieve some switching within revenues-- away from the present heavy reliance on employers* social security contributions-- at least in the case of lower-paid workers (see below). I/ For 1996, the targeted level of 3 percent for the general government deficit was attained on the basis of a primary surplus estimated by the staff at 5 3/4 percent of GDP-- some l/2 percent of GDP below the level that had been anticipated in the CSF report. u The projections in Chart 8 show, in addition to a "current policies" scenario, a band based on maintenance of the primary surplus at between 5 3/4 and 6 l/4 percent of GDP--representing, respectively, a less and more rigorous interpretation of the CSF recommendations.

In this connection, a reform of social security is indispensable in order to safeguard its financial integrity and essential features --which have been very successful in alleviating social hardship and have helped to achieve one of the lowest rates of poverty in the world. Staff noted that a comprehensive program of fiscal reform that was front-loaded, employment friendly, and credible in terms of long term pension commitments could help to achieve a virtuous circle: avoiding higher risk premia in interest rates while fostering somewhat more rapid economic growth through improved incentives and confidence/wealth effects on private spending. In particular, since a significant factor in the debt dynamics is the rising dependency ratio, the design of measures should explore all scope for strengthening incentives to participate in the labor force. Taken together, the effects of such measures on growth and employment could potentially contribute materially to improving the public debt ratio. The fiscal efforts of the Federal Government will need to be supported by continuing fiscal consolidation in the Regions and Communities. Turning to issues of implementation, the staff also emphasized the importance of selecting, from various policy options under consideration, a package of fiscal reforms that would strike a sound balance between three key policy goals: 0 As regards short- and medium-term fiscal objectives, measures of close to 1 percent of GDP will be required in 1997 to set the stage for a sustained primary surplus of at least 6 percent of GDP in 1997-2000; in the event of lower GDP growth than currently projected (an annual average of 2 l/4 percent), additional measures will be required. To achieve this adjustment, the targeting of social benefits could be tightened substantially--e.g., by confining eligibility for the family allowance to groups in need of income support. lJ Also, unemployment benefits and some pension benefits could be trimmed back-- or taxed in a manner more similar to earned income --and the de facto application of criteria for unemployment benefits could be further tightened. Continuing measures are needed--and are indeed in preparation-- to increase accountability and incentives for health care providers, patients, and insurers. Scope also remains for cutting subsidies paid to enterprises and for continuing to reduce the number of workers employed directly by the state. 1/ Given political resistance to the curtailment of such payments, an alternative could be to bring them within the base for income taxation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - l The longer term problem of pension expenditures needs to be addressed by a number of adjustments to the conditions of pensions. lJ Changes along these lines will not contribute substantially to fiscal consolidation in the short to medium term, but will yield sizeable benefits in the long term-- and are indeed essential in order to assure a sustainable long-term decline in the public debt ratio. In this connection, staff noted that the long term solvency of pension arrangements is of clear policy relevance now, insofar as this may affect risk perceptions and private sector decisions to save or invest. l Finally, the need to improve incentives for employment growth would be well-served by certain of the above-cited fiscal measures--notably adjusting net unemployment benefits, avoiding new early retirement schemes, and-- in addition-- effecting a further selective reduction in employers' social security contributions, offset by alternative tax-based funding. 2/ The authorities reacted positively to the thrust of the staff suggestions. They were convinced that the main structural fiscal problems should indeed be tackled in the course of 1996. They also acknowledged the economic case for achieving the fiscal consolidation through structural expenditure reforms rather than revenue measures, but noted the political and social sensitivities involved. The authorities laid particular stress on two considerations. First, they planned to proceed with careful soundings --which were already getting under way. Second, they attached importance to striking a balance between the introduction of greater efficiency and the maintenance of broad support for the social security system. 3. Labor market Under the present system of wage determination and regulation, social peace has generally been preserved and competitiveness has been adequately protected, albeit with the support of wage freezes--including the current real wage freeze for 1995-96. However, unemployment has increased sharply over the past decade and a half, with the increase very much concentrated (as in other European economies) among lower-skilled workers (Chart 10). The rate of participation in the labor market is among the lowest in the industrialized countries (Chart 11) and--as noted above--no new jobs, on a net basis, have been created for 25 years. L/ E.g., lengthening salary reference periods and changing indexation rules for civil servants, restraining the rise in benefit ceilings, and raising the retirement age for women. u In a system with significant wage rigidities, it is a reduction in the social security contributions of employers that appears most likely to achieve an increase in the demand for labor.

Negotiated wage levels, based on indexing and rendered pervasive by their legal enforceability, have served as a floor on wages. This appears to have reduced the demand for labor below desirable levels, particularly as regards lower skill workers. Moreover, the wage freezes inevitably have suppressed pay differentiation and weakened the responsibilities of the social partners. Finally, the authorities have rightly become concerned that current arrangements create incentives for employers and employees to agree on higher wage awards than justified by market realities --particularly in declining industries--and subsequently to present the unemployment/early retirement bill to the Government. Overall, the problem of employment needs to be addressed as a priority through labor market policy. The expiry in late 1996 of the current real wage freeze presents an opportunity to review the process and the legal bargaining framework for wage determination, together with other aspects of the labor market, and the authorities are beginning to explore with the social partners the scope and nature of a possible reform. In this connection, the staff suggested that it was worth considering options based on--or at least consistent over time with--relatively radical changes in the functioning of the labor market: 0 A key objective should be to inject into the bargaining system greater flexibility for wages at the enterprise level--so that wages can become more differentiated in response to market trends, including in the demand for low-skill labor. Operationally, this means that sector wage agreements, which set out comprehensive indications on rates of pay and terms of employment, should become more flexible regarding pay differentiation. l It would also be desirable to eliminate indexation in wage agreements; at present levels of inflation, there is an opportunity to achieve this. The focus in negotiations should shift to the total growth in nominal wages-- including both the inflation component and the real component-- in light of wage developments in competing industries in main trading partners and productivity changes in Belgium. lJ a The underlying long-term objective should be to achieve these changes by shifting the judgement of market realities back to employers and employees, relying on their direct interest in avoiding unnecessary labor- shedding and in creating new jobs. In this connection, the Government needs lJ Apart from the inflexibility of an indexed system in the event of terms of trade shocks, indexation has probably acted to restrain real wage differentiation; moreover, it appears inappropriate to maintain indexation in a monetary union when the anchor country and other major potential participants do not have an indexed wage system. If indexation is formally retained, flexibility for derogations or postponements needs to be built in. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - to underscore forcefully, at the beginning of wage rounds, the "rules of the game" in an open economy with an exchange rate anchor and a structural employment creation problem. 0 Shifting responsibilities back to the social partners will only work if adequate steps are taken to address distortions and perverse incentives in the policy framework. Hence there is a need to review the Government's de facto and de jure influence over wage-setting in the labor market through the national enforcement of collective bargaining agreements as well as through the social policy changes discussed above--notably regarding generous early retirement schemes and unemployment benefits. I/ l Finally, a reform is needed of regulations that inhibit job creation by making it difficult to hire or to shed full- or part-time labor, and initiatives would be appropriate to strengthen industrial training. In discussions with the authorities and social partners, the staff encountered strong views favoring an evolutionary rather than a radical process of change, with a view to harnessing the social consensus to promote employment. There was thus concern to avoid an unnecessarily aggressive attack on indexation, and particular unease about significant real declines in the pay of low skill workers. At the same time, it was acknowledged that the direction of change should be consistent with the longer run demands of an integrated and competitive European market. The staff recognized these concerns, but noted the danger that an incremental approach might not deliver adequate changes to incentives in the labor market--implying the risk of more disruptive changes at a later date. 4. Other structural auestions and external issues Staff noted that Belgium had implemented a series of financial sector reforms in recent years, but had escaped thus far systemic problems of instability and mis-allocation that frequently accompany financial liberalization. The object of the reforms had been to foster efficiency in the sector and to reduce the cost of public sector borrowing. Reform has been implemented relatively gradually; indeed, banks still live in something of a gilded cage: an example of this can be found in the inverse yield differentials at certain maturities between government and bank obligations. Discussions with the authorities and bankers indicated that, as Belgium becomes increasingly integrated in the European economy--and especially with European Monetary Union-- the domestic financial services sector would be u If it is decided that wage agreements should continue to be made legally enforceable by decree, then it could be decided that such decrees will not be issued in cases where settlements are judged by the Government to be out of line with market realities (e.g., the terms allow insufficient flexibility of implementation with regard to any indexation provisions and to the varying situations of enterprises/skills of labor). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - bound to evolve. Indeed, competitive pressures may result in more substantial institutional changes than have been seen in the past few years. Intermediaries such as private pension funds are likely to take an increasing share of savings-- particularly as public pensions are trimmed back. Public funding strategy is already shifting to direct marketing of debt to non-banks at all maturities. Competition in banking and insurance will increase further: two key influences would be the potential erosion of the domestic currency franchise under EMU, and the breakdown in barriers for insurance business within the European market. Such pressures will be reflected in structural changes in the financial sector, which is at present not very concentrated by international standards. In this environment, strong financial supervision has an important role to play, including for institutions operating across national borders, for financial conglomerates, and for the internal risk control systems of all institutions. I/ Vigilance in the period ahead will remain crucial. Discussions with the authorities also covered trends in savinv and investment balances in the economy. Fiscal consolidation in Belgium since 1981 has been accompanied by a rising external current account surplus, which is already among the largest in the industrialized world relative to GDP (Chart 12). This may prompt the question whether the likelihood of further increases in this external imbalance qualifies the arguments for continuing strong fiscal retrenchment over the medium term. However, there is no evidence that Belgium's external surplus is problematic. As regards trade policy, Belgium is strongly committed to support a liberal trading environment, and was one of the first countries to ratify the Uruguay Round. Moreover, the contribution of Belgian savings to the world economy is certainly welcome. By contrast, there is a very broad consensus in Belgium, underpinned by concerns relating to RMU and financial vulnerability, that the public debt is too high and that structural expenditure problems would, unless addressed, result in growing fiscal deficits in the future. On these grounds, the balance of arguments in favor of fiscal consolidation could not be clearer. 2J Similar considerations apply to the very welcome initiatives underway to promote efficiency and increase savings among the public enterprises, including through asset sales and privatization. In light of a broad correlation between levels of domestic saving and domestic investment that can be observed across economies, an important u The high level of cross-border interbank liabilities in the banking system reflects to a significant extent the re-cycling of deposits made in Luxembourg by Belgian residents (motivated by tax reasons); to that extent it is not considered to entail particular systemic risks. 2J The high and growing net foreign assets of the private sector have no doubt influenced favorably market perceptions of Belgium's external situation. However, their existence does not contribute pro tanto to reassurance concerning the credibility of the public finances in the sense of representing a latent source of revenue: the revenue ratio in Belgium is already high, and foreign asset holdings are notoriously difficult to tax. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - question is whether the large current account surplus in Belgium may in part reflect distortions in the economy. A clear possibility could be that labor market rigidities, or uncertainties about future tax rates, might be reducing prospective risk-adjusted after-tax returns on investment. Another possibility is that uncertainty about the credibility of fiscal policy might be leading economic agents to save "excessively" in case of more serious curtailments in the Government's social commitments than may in fact occur. In this connection, it is notable that the sector surplus of households--saving less investment --has been notably stable as a proportion of GDP over time (Chart 13). Thus the emergence of a large current account surplus cannot be traced clearly or directly to changes in the overall position of households. While it is possible that the high level of saving in part reflects concern about the fiscal outlook, no strong inference appears defensible with regard to the outlook for the next few years. By contrast, the financial position of the corporate sector has improved materially over recent years: following a gradual decline relative to GDP during the 1970's, corporate saving subsequently embarked on a strong recovery to record levels; but corporate investment has recovered only modestly in recent years. The factors that could be restraining the level of investment deserve additional policy attention. Certainly, fiscal and labor market initiatives along the lines discussed above would seem likely to move in the direction of reducing any distortions that may be discouraging investment. This would tend to mitigate the prospective increase in the current account surplus. The large and increasing current account surplus raises the question whether Belgium's exchange rate is at an appropriate level. Developments in unit labor costs, and in the real effective exchange rate based on unit labor costs in manufacturing industry, do not suggest that the exchange rate is undervalued at its present level (see Chart 2 and background paper). Moreover, the absence of net new job creation, and the high level of unemployment, do not appear consistent with excessive competitiveness. It appears more plausible that the large and growing current account surplus is to be explained in terms of incentives affecting saving and investment in the private sector, along the lines discussed above; to the extent it is a concern for policy, it should be addressed by policy actions that would eliminate distortions in the economy rather than by exchange rate adjustment. IV. Staff Annraisal Belgium has achieved impressive progress in recent years in cutting back the fiscal deficit and establishing its hard currency policy. A convincing start has been made in the crucial task of reducing the public debt ratio, in an economic setting that has not been easy. The credibility of monetary policy has reflected the readiness of the authorities to adjust interest rates to the full extent necessary to maintain the tight exchange rate link with the DM, and it was also crucially underpinned by the progress in fiscal consolidation. Indeed, the relatively low long-term interest rate Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14a - CHART 12 BELGIUM Current Account, Saving and Investment of Selected Industrial Countries in 1995 Current Account Balance (In Percent of GDP) a0 CUE 8EL HLD Jwl n* FRA Esp ta* DE” AU-8 WI USA Private Saving 26.0 . 240 72.0 20.0 (80 t6.0 14.0 L PN *UT WLD CmE i 1 ESP m* uw GBR USA 721) n Private Investment td* XI.0 - 18.0 x.0 14.0 IL 12.0 &In L DE” Sources: IMF.

The success of tight financial policies in reducing inflation and strengthening the balance of payments needs to be complemented at the present time by a major attack on structural problems in the economy, including notably the labor market. Indeed, the hard currency policy makes these structural imperatives if anything more urgent, To assure sustainable fiscal consolidation, a far-reaching review of social security is needed. A further challenge is to radically improve incentives that would result in the creation of new jobs. Thus, over the next few years, two policy objectives should be assigned overriding priority: a further, decisive reduction in the public debt ratio, and fuller employment in the economy. As regards fiscal consolidation, the implementation of measures to reduce the general government deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 1996 is most welcome. Attainment of this objective depends significantly on the Regions and Communities, which need to live up to existing commitments and make further contributions to fiscal consolidation in the coming years. The authorities will need to take additional measures as necessary to safeguard this deficit objective in the event of adverse developments, including the lower rate of GDP growth that now appears likely in 1996; such measures should take the form of expenditure reductions. For 1997 and beyond, the Conseil Superieur des Finances has proposed appropriately ambitious goals for the pace of fiscal consolidation, including notably the maintenance over the coming years of a primary surplus of at least 6 percent of GDP. The important step now, at an early stage in the life of the present government, is to put in place a program of reforms that would set fiscal policy firmly on a course consistent with this objective. Given the high ratio of government revenues to GDP, this should be achieved through expenditure reforms. Attainment of these fiscal objectives would indeed be facilitated by setting medium-term expenditure plans based on conservative economic assumptions--which, of course, is the more difficult route. A decisive and durable strengthening of the public finances along these lines inevitably implies reforms that are structural in nature. In particular, the social security system--which has alleviated hardship and assured one of the lowest rates of poverty in the world--needs to be streamlined in order to safeguard its essential objectives and longer term viability. Specifically, the deficit reduction goals discussed above would imply, in the view of the staff, a further permanent strengthening of .the primary fiscal surplus in 1997 of close to 1 percent of GDP, and somewhat more if growth weakens. This could best be achieved by improved targeting of social benefits; by bringing unemployment benefits more fully within the tax net, and further tightening eligibility; by continuing forceful action to change incentives for participants in the health care system; and by further-cuts in public subsidies and government employment. An increase in the tax wedge Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - should be avoided: if possible, the opportunity should be taken to make cuts in employers' social contributions, at least in the case of lower paid workers, offset by increases in taxation. Given demographic trends, the social security reform also needs to address the longer term problem resulting from the growth of pension expenditures. Policy actions along the above lines would also tend to improve fiscal incentives for participation in the labor force (notably through adjusting net unemployment benefits and avoiding new early retirement schemes, as well as by selective contribution reductions). However, creating fuller employment in Belgium also requires substantial changes in labor market policies and in the system of wage determination--to ensure that free bargaining does not result in a growth of average wages that is damaging to competitiveness and employment, and to increase wage dispersion according to sectors and skills. This implies greater flexibility in wage contracts as regards both indexation and wage differentiation. It is also most important to address elements of the labor market framework that result in negative effects for employment-- such as the legal enforcement of unviable wage contracts; expectations that the Government will mitigate the consequences of excessive real wages through generous early retirement schemes and unemployment benefits; and regulations that impede hiring and firing of employees. A critical mass of reforms --while no doubt daunting to press through-- is needed to have a measurable effect on employment. While less urgent than those discussed above, important issues also arise in the financial sector. Against the background of the gradual financial deregulation underway in recent years, which has been managed without crises, there may well be a quantum change in the period ahead in the competitive forces to which the banks and insurance companies are exposed. This will likely result in further institutional consolidation, and will require vigilant supervision. Finally, assessment of developments in the economy--whether macroeconomic or structural--has not been impaired by deficiencies in the official statistics. Nonetheless, standards have fallen somewhat behind some other industrial countries, and the renewed commitment to strengthening official statistics, including in the external sector, is very welcome. In sum, the main policy problems faced by the Belgian authorities are both deep-rooted and socially sensitive. They are being faced now in a difficult economic setting-- and the challenges of pressing forward with them should not be underestimated. Policy approaches need to be tailored in light of consultations with the main actors, but the choices are limited. The upside potential is, however, considerable: fiscal and labor market reforms along the lines discussed above, building on the substantial progress that has already been achieved, clearly can be mutually reinforcing in their impact on private sector expectations. They could thus have quite a powerful effect on spending patterns. On balance they should tend to raise the level of domestic private investment; to the extent there is any "over-saving" as a result of uncertainty or exaggerated concern about fiscal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - plans, this should also be reduced. Overall, fiscal consolidation is likely to result in some further increase in Belgium's external current account position, but this does not give rise to surveillance concerns; indeed, it should prove compatible with higher investment, employment, and growth in the economy.

Belgium retains restrictions vis-a-vis Iraq, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) pursuant to U.N. Security Council resolutions 661, 883, and 757, respectively. These restrictions have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51) in EBD/90/251 (a/17/90), EBD/94/187 (11/29/94), and EBD/92/139 (7/7/92).

The core statistical indicators, except foreign trade, for Rand surveillance purposes are all published on a timely basis (see attached table). Total value, volume, unit value and price data for foreign trade have been reported by the authorities only through 1992. The dates indicated for Exports/Imports in the attached table refer only to trade values and extra- European Union trade. However, the statistical infrastructure is generally considered to lag somewhat behind that of neighboring countries, and efforts are underway to upgrade statistical capabilities. In 1994, the National Institute for Statistics (NIS) was restructured and incorporated in a newly created National Accounts Institute (NAI). The NAI has no offices or staff but comprises a board of directors that delegates work to the NBB, the Planning Bureau and the NIS. The NBB is now in charge of compiling the foreign trade and national accounts statistics, and a major overhaul is being planned of the national accounts statistics in the context of the introduction of a new European system of national accounts (ESA). In the area of balance of payments statistics, from the beginning of 1995 current account transactions between Belgium and Luxembourg (on a cash basis) are being separated. The National Bank of Belgium sent a set of tables that are being used to construct new forms for reporting monetary statistics to STA. This is the first step toward the resumption of reporting of monetary &ta to STA since the interruption due to the introduction in December 1992 of a new system for &ta reporting by the central bank.
