Loungani, Arora, and Vamvakidis (all APD), Mr. Christofides @‘DR), Ms. Milne, Ms. Mitchell Cassellc (both MAE), Ms Kostial (FAD), Ms. Corm& (Assistant, APD), and Mr Lorie (Senior Resident Representative). World Bank staff and Ms. Man&c (OED) participated in some meetings. Technical assistance “&ions Tom FAD, MAE, PDR, and STA visIted Manila in April-May. . The last Article IV consultation was concluded on March 27, 1998. Executive Directors noted that the regional financial crisis had intermpted several years of strong economic pcrfonnance in the Philippines. Directors commended the authorities’ policy response-including the float of the peso, tighter fiscal and monetay policies, and structural reforms-that had helped reduce the impact of the crisis. Looking ahead, Directors noted the policy challcngcs of restori”g confidence in the economy, minimizing the social impact ofthe inevitable economic downturn, and addressing remaining vulnerabilities, especially in the banking system Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to a comprehensive econotic program for 1998-99, which would help to meet thcsc challc”ges. . At the same ttmc, a two-year SBA for SDR I ,02 I million (I 6 1 percent of quota) was approved. To date, SDR 387 million has been purchased, with the most recent purchase (for SDR 95 million) made on March I following completion of the third review. Completion of the fourth review would release the next purchase of SDR 158 million. The staff recommends completion of the fourth review, waiver of the end-March ceiling on the public sector inancing requirenxnt (PSFR), and moditication of the end-June ceihng on the PSFR. . Philippines has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains a” exchange system free of restnctlons on current International transactions. . It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle. . The principal authors of this report are Messrs. Arora and Rodlauer .

The macroeconomic program objectives are being achieved: the external situation has turned around, inflation has come down, and a recovery appears underway. With the stabilization goals well in hand, monetary policy has become more fully supportive of recovety, and fiscal policy remains geared toward supporting domestic demand, subject to medium-term sustainability. Rapid external adjustment is allowing a faster buildup of reserves than programmed, helping to further reduce external vulnerability. 2. Progress with structural reforms has been mixed. Banking, corporate, and trade reforms are broadly on track, but public sector reforms (especially tax administration and in the power sector) have proved more difficult than anticipated. The authorities are committed to re-invigorating reforms in those areas, 3. The economic slowdown appears to have bottomed-out, although the recovery outside agriculture remains to be fully established. Real GDP is expected to grow by l-3 percent this year, led by agriculture; the program assumes 2.2 percent. Inflation has moderated in recent months, and the program target of 7% percent at end-1999 is well within reach. The peso and the stock market have strengthened substantially since September last year. 4. The overall fiscal deficit target for 1999 remains unchanged despite au overrun in the “monitored” deficit (the subset of public sector operations captured by the performance criteria under the program). The underlying consolidated public sector deficit’ is programmed at 3.2 percent of GNP, implying that last year’s fiscal stimulus is broadly maintained. An overrun in the national government deficit during the first quarter, due to a revenue shortfall, is expected to be reversed during the remainder of the year mainly through expenditure savings. Strengthening budget revenues remains an important medium-term objective, with a renewed effort at better tax administration as well as several other public sector reform initiatives. The foreign budget financing envisaged under the program has been secured. The deficit of government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) is projected to be 0.5 percent of GNP higher than programmed, offset mainly by a higher surplus in the social security institutions. Measures are being taken to remedy the situation in the National Power Corporation (NPC), the main problem GOCC. The authorities have requested a waiver and modification of fiscal performance criteria for end-March and end-June 1999, respectively. ‘Defined as the deficit of the national government, government-owned and controlled corporations, social security institutions, government financial institutions, the BSP, the Central Bank Board of Liquidators, and local governments.

Monetary policy has been eased gradually since late 1998.The favorable inflation and external developments have ahowed reductions in interest rates to below-crisis levels. Even so, money and credit growth have remained weaker than programmed. For the period ahead, monetary policy will continue to aim at supporting the recovery while preserving the stabilization gains. Reflecting uncertain money demand, interest rates remain the driving variable of monetary policy, and monetary targets have been set with some margins. 6. Reserves are growing faster than programmed, helping reduce vulnerability. The current account is in surplus, and capital intlows have recovered with access to private markets restored as well as official support. NIR increased by $2.9 billion during January-May 1999. For the year as a whole, the revised program envisages a $3.2 billion increase in NIR-raising usable reserves to over 1% times short-term debt. 7. Staff analysis suggests that the peso currently is near its equilibrium level. The authorities reatXrmed their commitment to the floating exchange rate system. In the near term, they intend to use the opportunity of upward pressure on the peso mainly to add to reserves and lower interest rates, to reduce external vulnerability and support the recovery II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK 8. There are increasing signs that a recovery in output has begun, although the evidence outside agriculture is still tentative (Rex 1). During the first quarter of 1999, GDP growth was 1.2 percent (12-month basis), led by agriculture which grew by 2.6 percent While industry remained subdued, some leading indicators such as import growth have also . . . . . . . . .._ .._. ~..r _.._ . . . . . . . . . . . , . . . . . . . ~ . . . . . . . . . 1 .I *.ge (“on-.gris.j 1.5 I 0 1 0 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.5 -0 5 1 .o -4 .o 1 .5 -1.5 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- Box 1. Prospects for Recovery Since the last review, prospects for a recovery ofecanomic growth have improved.

Growth in 1999 is projecti to bc in the upper part of the program’s forecast range (l-3 percent), driven by a recovery in agriculture and :xport growth. Lower interest rates and fiscal stimulus should also help. However, there are still some uncertaintics about the recovery of the industrial sector, and leading indicators of economic activity arc mixed. On the supply side: . The industrial sector (in the GDP accounts) declined in the first quarter of 1999 by about 1.3 percent on a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter (s.a.qu -qu.) basis, compared with a decline of 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998. The sector co&acted by-l.9 percent;” l&8. . Services increased by 1.0 percent on a s.a.qu.-qu. basis in the first quarter of 1999, compared with 0.9 percent during the fourth quarter of 199X. The sector grew by 3.5 percent in 1998. . Agrieulturc recovered strongly in the first quartcrof 1999, growing by 8.0 percent on a s.a.qu.-qu. basis. after declining by 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998. The seetor declined by 6.6 percent in 1998. On the demand side: . Private consumption grew by 2.5 percent on a qu,-qu. basis in the first quarter of 1999, while government consumption grew by 7.6 percent during the same period. . Investment, hawcvcr, dcclincd by 7.7 percent on B qu.-qu. basis during the tint quarter of 1999, following a decline by 22.3 pcrcent in the fourth quarter of 1998. Lendbug indicators of economic activity point to P beginning of the recovery, with various sectors at different stages of bottoming out and recovery. The recovery outside agriculture still has to be firmly estnbliihed. Positive signs: . The volume of manufacturing production increased by 7.9 percent in March (month-to-month), continuing the upward trend from the two previous months. . Imports have picked up, growing by 5.7 percent in April (12.month basis), compared with 1.5 percent in March. . The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index has increased by about 20 percent since tie beginning of the year. and has more than doubled since its historic low in September 1998. . The Department of Agriculture projects a strong rebound in rice and corn production in the first half of 1999. . Domestic credit to the private sector contracted by 4 percent in March (12.month rate), a slight improvement from a contraction by 5 percent in February (and following B steady decline of credit growth during 1998). Negative signs: . Employment in industry declined by 3.5 pcrccnt in April. . Exports grew by 2.7 percent (IZ-month basis) in April, a significant slowdown from March (9.2 percent) and compared with average growth of 16.9 in 1998. . Meralco electricity sales fell by 1.4 percent in February . The ratio of nonpcrfoorming loans to total loans of commercial banks increased to 13.1 percent at the end-March, from 10.4 percent at the end-1998, suggesting that banks continue to be cautious in their lending.

For the year as a whole, GDP growth is projected in the range of 1-3 percent, with the financial program based on 2.2 percent (Figure II. l), which is roughly the same as the June consensus forecast (2.0 percent). Key risks around the forecast are about evenly balanced.’ The authorities now expect GDP growth of about 2.6-3.2 percent. 9. Inflation has declined in recent months, with the 1999 program target of 7% percent well within reach (Figure 11.2). Consumer price inflation (12-month basis) fell from 11.5 percent in January to 6.7 percent in May, reflecting stabilizing food prices, the effects of peso appreciation, and weak domestic demand.

The NC deficit in early 1999 was larger than programmed mainly because of a shortfall in tax collections (Table II. 1). The shortfall reflected the combined effect of a weaker tax base (with the recovery being led by agriculture and exports, both lightly taxed), continued problems in tax administration, larger refunds on 1998 income tax payments, and delays in programmed revenue measures’. As a result, the ceiling for the public sector Table II.1 National Govcmmcnt Operations, Jan.-May 1999 (in billions of pesos) January-March January-May Program Actual Program Actual RWC”UC 118.4 105.1 215.2 201.0 Of which: Domestic based taxes 89.3 76.0 166.9 151.7 Expenditure 140.8 138.6 254.6 246.3 Deficit (-) -22.4 -33.5 -39.4 45.3 (percent of annual GDP) -0.7 -1.0 -1.3 -1.4 financing requirement (PSFR) at end-March was exceeded by P 6 billion or 0.2 percent of annual GNP.

The peso has appreciated by 6 percent in nominal effective terms since end-l 998, while the BSP has purchased over $2 billion from the foreign exchange market. At the same time, the BSP gradually lowered interest rates (by about 4 percentage points)’ as well as reserve requirements. Interest rates are now below pre-crisis levels, although still somewhat higher than in most crisis-affected countries (Table 11.3). The stock market is about 20 percent higher than at end-1998 (over twice the low of last September). 13. The external position has improved significantly, reflecting a turnaround in both the current- and capital accounts. Gross usable reserves have increased by $3 billion this year, to $12.6 billion. Exports have continued to grow, although at a slowing pace;6 imports, after failing strongly in 1998, have leveled off in recent months. As a result, the trade balance has been in surplus (Table 11.4). For the year as a whole, a current account surplus of 2. I percent of GNP is projected. “As of mid-June, the benchmark three-month T-bill rate had fallen to 9.2 percent from 13.4 percent at end-1998, and prime rates to 11.7 percent from 16.3 percent. “Export growth in April fell to 2.6 percent (la-month basis), from 15 percent in the first quarter. The decline reflected a slowdown in most major export categories, with shipments to the United States and Japan being most affected.

The program objectives remain to (i) consolidate the stabilization gains; (ii) support the recovery; and (iii) lay the foundation for sustained rapid medium-term growth. The policy strategy continues to embrace a moderately expansionary fiscal stance, supported by external financing and within a framework for medium-term fiscal sustainability; a gradual relaxation in the monetary stance conditional on disinflation and peso stability; and structural reforms. The main program targets are set out below: Table III. I Main Program Targets Real GDP growth, percent lnilation (end year), percent Current account balance (billions of dollars) Gross adjusted reserves @ercent of short-tern debt) Public sector balance (percent of GNP) 1998 ACti -0.5 10.4 1.3 94 -2.9 I999 1999 Program Revised EBS/99/6 pK$Wtl 2.5 2.2 7.5 7.5 0.4 I.7 IO1 I38 -3.2 -3.2 A. Fiscal Policy 16. The discussions on fiscal policy centered on the appropriate policy stance in light of the continued weakness in revenues, the objective of supporting the recovery, and medium-term considerations. Fiscal targets had been relaxed at the last review, to support domestic demand. The authorities and the staff were reluctant to raise the deficit target tInther, mainly because it would add to the already high public debt and possibly affect market perceptions. The revenue shortfall, however, would be difficult to reverse fully during the rest of the year, and the authorities thus focussed on identifying expenditure savings. For the medium term, strengthening the revenue effort remains an important goal. 17. Reflecting these considerations, the public sector deficit target for 1999 has been maintained at 3.2 percent of GNP (14), with a possible upward adjustment by up to 0.3 percent of GNP. A higher deficit would only be allowed in case of higher-than- programmed settlements of budget payables from previous years (nonrecurrent in subsequent years). The NG deficit is projected at 2.7 percent of GNP. This stance of fiscal policies implies a roughly neutral fiscal impulse, following the stimulus of 1997-98 (Box 2). There was agreement that the slightly higher deficit, were it to be necessary, would still be consistent with the main program objectives (with external adjustment and disinflation ahead of the 8Unless otherwise indicated, paragraph references in this staffreport relate to the Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (SMEFP, Attachment).

Fiscal Stance, 1998-99 As presented in the last Staff Report (EBS/99/6, Box 3), fiscal policy in 1999 was designed with a broadly neutral fiscal impulse, following two years of expansionary fiscal policy. As shown in the table below, the revised projections maintain this objective, based on the outcome for 1998 and revised growth assumptions for 1999. However, while the program for 1999 had foreseen a positive expenditure stimulus roughly offset by higher revenues, the revised projections imply a small revenue stimulus offset by lower expenditures (reflecting shortfalls in tax revenue and a lower interest bill, respectively). The authorities’ fiscal targets for 2000 imply a negative fiscal impulse of about 0.9 percent of GDP.

As envisaged, the deficit is being financed mainly from foreign sources, which has allowed the lowering of interest rates to support the recovery. 18. National government revenues in 1999 are projected at 16.3 percent of GNP, 1 percentage point of GNP lower than programmed. The shortfall reflects the factors described in 110 above. The authorities recognized the need to re-invigorate the action plan to improve tax administration (see Section 1V.C below). The government would continue to press for the revenue measures pending in Congress which are, however, unlikely to deliver significant additional revenue in 1999. Congress may become more amenable to passing revenue measures as the recovery takes hold. On balance, therefore, it was considered appropriate to assume that average monthly tax collection during the rest of the year would stabilize at the January-April level. 19. The revenue shortfall is expected to he broadly offset by lower expenditure. The authorities indicated that because of savings on interest payments’ and settlement of accounts payable from previous years,” there was no need at this stage to cut into other expenditure programs. However, they stressed that the downward revision to accounts payable was not a firm estimate, and they wished to keep room in the program for full settlement during 1999. An adjustor to the fiscal performance criterion allows a higher deficit by up to P 10 billion (0.3 percent of GNP) for this purpose. 20. Should revenues fall further, the authorities intend to reduce expenditures to keep within the deficit target (16). They would first cut from the “fiscal stimulus package” (which had revived IL 22 billion of unused appropriations from previous years), and agreed to pace hnther releases from the stimulus package with revenue performance in the coming months. Only as a last resort would cuts be made from 1999 budget appropriations.” 21. Measures to improve expenditure control and eliminate arrears were an important topic of the discussions, in collaboration with a parallel Fund technical assistance mission. As noted, the revised 1999 cash budget includes P 50 billion to settle all ‘The program assumed average 3-month T-bill rates of 16 percent “Accounts payable from 1997-98, to be settled in 1999, were programmed at B 60 billion. Revised estimates indicate, however, that around P 50 billion should suffice for full settlement See Annex 1X. “80 percent of appropriations have already been released to spending agencies, as part of budget reforms that combine greater latitude in budget execution with more performance- based controls. The authorities said that withdrawing those releases would undermine this important reform. The remaining 20 percent are for calamity reserves, foreign-financed projects, and other items difficult to cut.

The deficit of government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) is now projected at 1.1 percent of GNP (714). This is higher than originally programmed (0.6 percent) because of lower electricity sales and a delay in raising power tariffs (implemented in June); a new initiative to jump-start growth in agriculture (involving equity participation and net lending by the National Development Corporation @DC)); a higher deficit of the National Food Authority (NFA) owing to bumper crops in rice and corn; and reclassification of some investment outlays hitherto treated as a financing item.” The authorities stressed that the deterioration in the GOCCs’ finances reflected mainly temporary factors including the sharp slowdown in activity (part of the problem of NPC and higher net lending by NDC) and unusual weather conditions (NFA). They agreed to phase out the involvement of NDC as the economy recovers, and at any rate to limit it to no more than P 5 billion (114). The more deep-seated problems of the NPC are to be addressed in the context of a comprehensive power sector reform (Section 1V.D below). 23. The wider GOCC deficit is broadly offset by improvements in other elements of the public sector (mainly the Social Security institutions (SSI)), leaving the overall Fiscal target intact. The improvement in the outlook for the SSI reflects a better outturn in 1998 and the first quarter of 1999, which resulted partly from an extension in coverage. 24. Based on their commitment to attain the overall tiscal target for 1999, the authorities have requested a waiver of the end-March ceiling on the PSFR, as well as a modification of the ceiling for end-June. As noted, the NG revenue shortfall in 1999 is expected to be offset by lower expenditures, and the authorities are committed to strengthening the revenue effort over the medium term. The PSFR in 1999 is higher than programmed because of a higher GOCC deficit, offset by better performance of SSI. 25. The authorities remain committed to fiscal consolidation starting next year. The public sector deficit in 2000 is programmed to narrow by 1 percent of GNP (to 2.2 percent), with a similar reduction in the NG deficit (Table 4). Further consolidation is planned for subsequent years in line with the medium-term outlook presented in Section V. The fiscal program for 2000 will be an important sub,ject of the next review, ‘*Of the accounts payable in March 1998, less than P 10 billion is estimated to have been in arrears (“due and demandable”). “Part of a power sector investment project had been classified as a negative financing item.

With the external accounts turning around and inflation on track, monetary policy is becoming more fully supportive of the recovery. The authorities noted, and staff agreed, that the pragmatic approach of monetary policy over the past two years had contributed to successful crisis management-with interest rate policy “leaning against” exchange market pressures, and a gradual easing of the monetary stance as the external situation stabilized and inflation remained under control. Looking ahead, staff noted the need to revisit the objectives and framework of monetary policy once the crisis subsides. The BSP explained that in the coming months it intended to continue to reduce interest rates gradually, conditional on peso stability and disinflation. In the longer run, the monetary framework would remain under review; as money demand stabilized, monetary targets would likely resume greater importance than in the recent past. Although the BSP considered adoption of a formal inflation targeting framework as premature,” the inflation outlook would continue to weigh heavily in monetary policy decisions. 27. Monetary growth projections for 1999 were left unchanged, despite below- program money and credit expansion in recent months (Tables 5 and 6). Staffhad initially proposed lowering the targets in light of recent developments. However, the authorities argued that a reduction would send a signal to markets that monetary policy was being tightened, at a time when the economy had barely bottomed out. In their view, the sizable margins under the ceilings were evidence of prudent monetary management and should not be cause for tightening the program. The agreed base money ceilings for September and December (SMEFP, Annex LB) leave margins of about P 15 billion (5 percent) and P 20 billion (6% percent), respectively, relative to the staffs forecasts (Table 5). which is appropriate given the uncertainties in money demand (including because of YZK). 28. The peso will continue to float, with foreign exchange market intervention to meet the reserve target and for smoothing operations.” Staff analysis suggests that the peso is currently at a level consistent with medium-term external equilibrium (Annex VI). The authorities broadly agreed with this assessment. Looking ahead, the staff cautioned against sliding back into renewed rigidity of the exchange rate. The authorities emphasized that they were not aiming at a specific target range for the peso. They indicated that at the current juncture, the BSP would use the opportunity of upward pressure on the peso mainly to further strengthen the reserve position and lower interest rates (given the importance of reducing external vulnerability and nurturing the recovery). After attaining a comfortable reserve position, they agreed, greater exchange rate flexibility was advisable, including for dealing “See also EBS/98/50,fl27, and M/98/43, “To allow intervention during periods of intense exchange market pressure, the NIR performance criteria are set $800 million below the indicative targets (Annex 1.C. of the SMEFP).

Outstanding nondeliverable forward contracts (NDFs) have fallen to zero, in line with the commitment to phase them out this year (118). 29. The authorities remain committed to maintaining a sound financial position of the BSP (117). Draft legislation has been submitted to Congress to restore the BSP’s tax exempt status (which expired in July 1998-EBS/99/6,126). This would be accompanied by an increase in BSP profit transfers to the government. The tax burden on the BSP has, however, diminished as monetary operations have been moved to instruments that do not incur tax.16 C. Balance of Payments and External Debt Management 30. Rapid external adjustment has substantially reduced vulnerabilities. There was agreement that raising the ratio of reserves to short-term debt remained a priority, since-although much improved from late 1997-it remained lower than in many neighboring countries (Table 10). Accordingly, the program now targets an increase in NJR of $3.2 billion in 1999, compared with $1.6 billion programmed earlier (119). 31. The current account surplus is projected to rise slightly in 1999 (Table 7). Imports, after contracting 13 percent (in volume terms) in 1998, appear to have bottomed out. Export volume growth is projected to moderate to 13 percent, from 20 percent last year, reflecting some slowdown of demand in the U.S. and Europe and a recovery of exports of Asian competitors.” 32. Net capital inflows during 1999 are projected at $1.5 billion, compared with SO.1 billion in 1998. The government has already virtually completed its external borrowing program for this year (Table 8 and SMEFP, Annex 1 .C). As noted, private sector inflows have also started to recover, although on a net basis the improvement is partly offset by reductions in short-term debt and a re-building of commercial banks’ net foreign asset position. Overall, the turnaround in the external accounts is resulting in a significant improvement in the key vulnerability indicators (Table 9). 16A special deposit facility for banks and paperless open-market operations (which are not subject to documentary stamp tax). Revised projections are for a tax burden ofP 7 billion on the BSP in 1999, compared with P 18 billion projected earlier. “This projection assumes that the slowdown of exports in April (113 above) does not announce a sudden break in the recent trend.

The banking system remains under stress, but the situation is under control and banking reforms are on track. The share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) in total loans rose to I3 percent in March 1999. With NPLs expected to peak during 1999, no large banks are at risk of failure. Tighter prudential and supervisory standards are strengthening the system’s capacity to withstand shocks. Reform and privatization of the Philippine National Bank (PNB), the only large bank in financial difficulties, are proceeding. Annex VII describes banking sector reforms in greater detail. 34. Notwithstanding the continued rise in nonperforming loans, several other indicators suggest that pressures in the banking system may be easing. Emergency advances by the BSP peaked in May 1998 (at P 14 billion, or 0.5 percent of GNP) and have fallen slightly since then. The average capital adequacy ratio of banks at end-1998 was 17.6 percent, higher than at end- 1997 ( I6 percent) and well above the 10 percent regulatory requirement.” Supervision capacity and the regulatory framework are being strengthened, and the BSP is taking appropriate measures (following a “ladder” of prompt corrective actions) to deal with banks that are not in compliance with regulatory norms.‘9 These measures are inducing capital infusions and mergers, or may lead to downgrading of licenses and closure of banks. In addition, the recovery, combined with lower interest rates and peso stability, is expected to enhance the ability of borrowers to service loans. 35. Against this background, the discussions focused on issues in implementing the tighter regulatory framework and outstanding reforms. The authorities expressed concern that the tighter norms might unduly constrain credit expansion. Specifically, the BSP has freed any net increase of loans above the March level from the general provision requirement (set to reach 2 percent in October 1999). Staff cautioned against regressing from best international practice and regulatory forbearance, but acknowledged that the general provision requirement was comparatively high (Annex VII, Table 5) and had been established when supervision and risk management practices were weaker than at present. It was agreed that the exemption and the appropriateness of the two-percent requirement would be reviewed once credit growth had normalized and bank supervision strengthened Cuther (125). There was agreement that the BSP should deal vigorously with instances of failure to meet regulatory standards. In particular, the BSP explained that the new framework of prompt corrective actions to deal with capital deficient banks was being followed strictly. “The increase reflects both the higher minimum capital and a shift in bank assets from commercial lending to zero-risk-weighted assets (such as government paper). i9At end-1998, a number of banks (representing about 7 percent of total banking assets) failed to meet the higher minimum capital requirements.

The financial sector tax reform package initiated at the last review is moving ahead (110 and Box 3), with draft legislation shortly to be submitted to Congress. However, the authorities remain undecided on the timing of introducing tax deductibility of specific loan-loss provisions (because of fiscal concerns) and on raising the withholding tax on interest income from nonresidents’ foreign currency deposits (for fear of triggering a move of deposits offshore). Box 3. Reform of Financial Sector Taxation fhe current system of taxation of the financial sector distorts economic actiwty and acts as a disincentive to inancial intamediation in the Philippines.’ The authorities are preparing draft legislation to comprehensively -efonn the system, moving away from taxation of individual transactions and gross flows toward a profit-based ,ax system. The main elements of this reform, which is expected to be submitted to Congress shortly, are as ‘OIIOUX The Gross Receipts Tax (charged on financial institutions’ gross receipts of interest, commissions and discounts from lending, and income from financial leasing) will be replaced by a “Better Alternative Tax” (BAT). The BAT, which is a noncreditable tax on profits and wages of financial institutions, has been designed as a proxy of a tax on the value-added of banks. The design of the BAT takes into account considerations of simphcity, ease of administration, mini”““” risk of abuse or avoidance, and predictability of revenues. Partly because of these, it will lack some of the important features of a VAT- such as the ability to pass input credits on to customers through an invoice-resulting in some cascading effect. The structure of the Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) will be slmphfied The DST will be retained on primary issues of financial instruments. bank checks, etc., and the rates for similar instruments will be unitied The DST on secondary issues will be phased out or reduced, depending on the revenue Impact. The tar arbitrage due to the preferential treatment of income from foreign currency loans (cwrently taxed at IO percent) will be eliminated by subjecting this income to the regular corporate rate of 33 percent. The withholding tar rate on interest income from foreign currency deposits (FCDs) is to be increased from 1.5 percent to IO percent (compared with 20 percent for peso deposits). The authorities are also considering the introduction of tax deductibility of specific loan-loss provisions, but revenue considerations may lead them to postpone this measure. fhe authorities intend to introduce these reforms in a revenue-neutral manner. However, as the estimates of their wenue implications have not yet been tinalizcd, some tax rates (such as the rate of the BAT) have not yet been Wan”& Revenue considerations may also cause the authorities to opt for phased introduction of some of the zhanges. ‘For details of the current taxation of the financial sector see Box 6 in EBSl9916.

The prudential and supervisory framework continues to he upgraded, including through tighter treatment of restructured loans, regular stress tests for commercial banks, and training of supervisory staff . Necessary amendments to the General Banking Act and the Central Bank Act have been submitted to Congress. 37. As a result of the ongoing reforms, the Philippines has made major progress toward conformity with the Basle Core Principles. The only major exception results from the bank secrecy law (which precludes supervisors’ access to key information). The authorities remain reluctant to modify the law, however, in part because of concerns that it could precipitate capital flight. Progress is also being made in strengthening prudential-based management of cross-border flows (see Annex VII, 721). 38. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fully privatize the remaining government stake in the PNB by mid-June 2000, at the latest (126). An external audit of the bank has been initiated, as a basis for designing the action plan toward privatization of the bank. A rights issue to existing owners is envisaged in 1999 to remedy the current shortfall from the required capital adequacy ratio.” B. Corporate Sector 39. Progress is being made in improving the corporate debt resolution framework. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has drafted a new set of rules governing debt suspension, establishing time-bound procedures and giving somewhat greater protection to secured creditors (727). SEC expects the new rules to be effective by end-July 1999. SEC has also made progress with other agreed reforms (Annex VIII). At the same time, there has been a marked slowdown in the rate at which new debt suspension cases have been filed.*i 40. The authorities intend to broaden the agenda for corporate sector reforms. While they agreed that strengthening of the SEC-led process was essential in the near term, they saw the need for medium-term reform of the framework for insolvency and debt resolution including a new bankruptcy law. This and other reforms affecting corporate governance will be supported mainly by the World Bank.** “In early 1999, provisions of about P 9 billion were constituted retroactively for 1998, reducing the capital adequacy ratio to about half of the required IO percent. “In the largest insolvency case before it (Philippine Airlines), the SEC recently approved a restructuring plan including a $200 million equity infusion. **The modalities of World Bank support for corporate sector reforms remain to be (continued.. .)

While a number of steps have been implemented, some key changes have not materialized as envisaged in the “Action Plan” of early 1998. In particular, effective control of large taxpayers, strong audit programs, and credible enforcement remain to be established. Box 4. Tax Administration Reform Over the past decade, there have been repeated attempts to reform the Bureau of lntemal Revenue (BIR). Despite these efforts, BIR was not able to signiticantly improve its collection perfomuncc. A review in January 1998 found that BIR . faced major problems with taxpayer compliance and widespread corruption; . had only limited control over refunds and the granting of tax credit certificates; . had not folly implemented the large taxpayer imtiative launched in the early 1990s; and . did not have an efTective information system In response, the authorities in early I998 drew up an “action plan” with technical assistance from the IMF @BS/98/50,3/13/98; pp. I 16 Q. The action plan formed an important part of the economic and fmancial program supported by the current SBA. While the authorities have implemented parts of this agenda, some of the most important goals remain to be accomplished. Among the measuresfiUy implemented are the cross-checking with tax returns and establishment of a new system of bank remittances for large taxpayers; the introduction of improved tax return and payment forms and data entry; the training of BIR personnel in excise tax administration; and the issuing of an updated VAT handbook. Important nreawres patif& imp.Gmented and/or in progress include reorganization of BIR headquarters; computaization of tax administration; development of an electronic tiling system; and establishment of statistical procedures to improve excise control. Progress has fallen short o/program expectations m the following areas: . control of large taxpayers remains fragmented; . audit programs are weak; and . collection enforcement remains disappointing, with only a small portion of assessed arrears actually collected. The authorities recognize the importance of these &men& of the action plan. However, they also expressed some doubts about the feasibility or appropriateness of some of ILS specitic recommendations. in particular, they had diculty with the transfer of all major aspects of large taxpayer control to a new unit or service reporting directly to BIR headquarters. The basic purpose and strategy of an effective audit and enforcement program was also an issue against a practice of granting repeated tax amnesties. It was agreed to comprehensively re-evaluate the action plan at a joint BIR-FAD workshop in late June. The workshop is to result in an agreed revised blueprint for comprehensive reform of the BIR 2’(. .continued) determined.

The authorities stressed their continued commitment to the reform of tax administration (y7), hut raised some doubts about certain elements of the “Action Plan.” Recent revenue performance, they noted, had only heightened their determination to reform the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BTR). However, the discussions also showed that the authorities remained unconvinced about some of the modalities of large taxpayer control and audit functions. 43. Against this background, it was agreed to comprehensively re-evaluate the BTR’s reform strategy at a workshop in late June (19). Agreement on a revised blueprint for reforms is a condition of this review. Staff will report on the outcome of the workshop before the Board discussion of the review. D. Other Structural Reforms 44. Public sector reforms are an important part of the medium-term refarm agenda (7129 and 30). The authorities are developing a matrix of reforms, in collaboration with the World Bank, to be supported by two program loans (Public Sector Reform Loan (PSRL) and Financial Sector Reform (FIN) Loan.z3 Key reforms under the PSlU include reforming the central government bureaucracy; improving the medium-term budget framework and expenditure management, strengthening intergovernmental fiscal relations; rationalizing tax incentives and continued strengthening of tax administration; and reducing corruption in the public sector. The FIN loan will focus on strengthening the systems for contractual savings (social security and pensions) and housing finance. 45. Power sector reforms should now move ahead. The reforms, developed with support of the AsDB, are ready to go ahead once Congress passes the Omnibus Electricity Bill. The authorities hope for passage of the bill at a special session of Congress in July, which would enable the increasingly pressing reforms and privatization of the NF’C (13 1). 46. Trade and investment liberalization continues (132). Average tariffs will decline from 10.7 percent in 1998 to 10.1 percent in 199gZ4 and 8.2 percent in 2000. The maximum tariff rate, which applies to some agricultural goods, will be reduced to 65 percent in 1999 (from 80 percent). Draft legislation has been submitted to liberalize foreign investment in the retail sector and to raise the foreign ownership limit in distressed banks to 100 percent (to be *‘Both loans were expected to be in place before end-1999, but World Bank staff recently indicated that preparations for the PSRL may take until early 2000.

E. Statistical Issues 47. The BSP is working to further improve external debt, balance of payments, and banking statistics, with technical assistance from STA (721, and Annexes Xl and XII). It is also, with assistance from PDR and STA, strengthening short-term debt monitoring systems, to provide high-frequency information on debt rollover rates as well as data on creditors. However, estimates of balance of payments transactions through FCDU accounts remain clouded by bank secrecy, and little progress has been made in developing alternative data sources. The Philippines has subscribed to the SDDS and its meta data are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board @SBB) (Box 5). Box 5. Compliance with SDDS Compliance has been achieved in the key statistical areas (includiig the national accounts, employment and unemployment, consumer prices, interest rates, the balance of payments, international resenres, and merchandise trade). An action plan is being developed for those areas that are still behind schedule. The authorities will submit an advance release calendar to the Fund shortly and will establish a hyperlink by end-l 999. The main outstanding P~CP(I are as follows. . Production index. Timeliness to be improved to 6 weeks (from 8 weeks). . Producer prices. Timeliness to be improved lo I month (from 8 weeks). . General government or public sector operations. Sectoral details on financing to be brought in line with requirements. . Wages and enmiogs. Timeliness is one year (the SDDS requirement is one quarter). . International investment position (IIP). Requirement has not been met as data are not yet available. The authorities intend to meet the first three of these requirements by end-1999. Budgetay and technical constraints, however, may cause delays. The authorities do not expect to meet the requirements for “wages and earnings” and for the III’ during 1999. For wages and eamings, timeliness will remain one year (the data rcfcr to the minimum wage, which rarely changes on a quarterly basis). For the IIF’, a work plan is being developed with a view to disseminating such data within five years. F. Social, Governance, and Other Issues 48. The regional financial crisis and last year’s drought have had adverse social effects, but the impact appears to have been cushioned by some policy measures “This requirement may be further modified (see Annex VII, Footnote 4) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - (Box 6). An interim survey26 suggested that the drought has had a greater impact than the financial crisis on social welfare. Adverse effects were mainly from higher prices and labor market uncertainties, and were most sharply felt in the agricultural sector. Although no quantitative estimates are available, this suggests that poverty (mainly a rural phenomenon in the Philippines) increased in 1998. Government expenditures in social areas-including education, health and nutrition-fell in 1998. This owed in part to the budget cuts implemented in early 1998 (see EBS/98/50, fi25), notwithstanding the later exemption of key social services from those cuts. The impact of the drought was contained through emergency imports and distribution of rice, and expanded assistance from government health agencies and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). The authorities are preparing a range of measures to address structural weaknesses in the social departments, with support from a World Bank Social Expenditure Management Loan (expected to be approved in October 1999). Box 6. Socioeconomic Developments in the Philippines in 1997-98 Social welfare in 1997-98 was adversely affected by the El NiiIo drought and the regional financial crisis. The effects were felt mainly through higher prices and in the iabor market (wages/employment). These were especially pronounced in the rural sector, where poverty incidence has traditionally been higher. A survey conducted in 1998 suggested that a large proportion of households had responded by scaling down consumption standards. ’ A combination of factors mitigated the socioeconomic impact of the regional financial crisis and the drought (EBS/99/6, Box 7). These factors included: (i) the economic slowdown in the Philippines was far less severe than in other Asian crisis countries; (ii) the government took some steps to protect social expenditures in the 1998-99 budgets; (iii) the government countered part of the impact of the drought on the price of staples such as rice through emergency imports; and (iv) consumption was supported by overseas workers’ remittances. Nevertheless, budget cuts and slow disbursement of funds affected some critical social programs and projects. A survey of social sector agencies conducted by the Philippine authorities indicated CULS in select services in education (including in the provision of new classrooms and text books) and health (including in budgets of government-run hospitals, vaccinations, and nutrition programs). In mid- 1998, the across-the-board expendihrre cuts imposed in early I998 were lifted for essential social services. Progress with Lhe agenda nutlined in the World Bank Social Expenditure Management Loan is critical to improve socioeconomic outcomes over the coming years. While the recavay of growth and continuing disinflation should help improve socioeconomic outcomes, additional steps are needed. The authorities arc discussing with the World Bank a Social Expenditure Management Loan that would: (i) provide immediate budget support for basic social services in the areas of education and health; and (ii) initiate steps to improve the efliciency of social sector departments by reforming procurement and disbursement procedures and strengthening fmancial management. - ‘Comprehensive data on soao-economic developments are available only through 1997, 261998 Annual Poverty Indicators Survey.

The Presidential Commission Against Graft and Corruption and the Commission on Audit (COA) are expected to be at the forefront of this effort. The World Bank is assisting in developing this agenda, which includes moving toward systems that reduce official discretion; more competitive salaries in senior government positions; and involving NGOs in the monitoring of the bureaucracy. World Bank assistance will focus on (i) improving corporate and public sector governance; (ii) reforming procurement and financial management in the social departments; (iii) improving the quality of services devolved to local governments; and (iv) improving governance in Bank-financed projects. Military spending 50. Military spending in the Philippines is relatively low by international standards, with relevant data publicly available on a regular basis. Military expenditure in the budget has averaged 1% percent of GNP in recent years (compared with an Asian average of 1.7 percent of GNP).” The civil authorities have reliable information on military spending. COA has permanent auditors located at the relevant agencies, who submit a quarterly report on military outlays to Congress. Data on military spending are regularly published. Year 2000 (YZK) 5 1. While progress has been made in preparing for the Y2K problem, substantial work remains to be done (Box 7). The Presidential Commission on Year 2000 Compliance has provided overall supervision and guidance. The financial, telecommunications, and manufacturing sectors are relatively well prepared, but the government, utilities, health care, and transportation (including air transport) sectors are not. The Presidential Commission is formulating a national contingency plan, focusing on key sectors and on sectors that may not achieve full Y2K preparedness in time. *‘An extrabudgetary Armed Forces Modernisation Fund (AFMP), financed by the sale of a former military base, was established in 1995 but is not yet operational.

Year 2000 (Y2K) Readiness The Philippine authorities have made considerable efforts to deal with the YZK problem. The Presidential Commission on Year 2000 Compliance is tasked with raising public awareness of the Y2K problem, recommending regulation that can accelerate compliance, and ensuring compliance in the private and governmeat sectors. The Commission focuses on compliance in seven key sectors: utilibes, telecommunications, transportation, fmance, health care, manufechlring and government. A special Y2K law is expected to be passed shortly, requiring all businesses to stale their preparedness in public advertisements. The Commission reports varied progress among sectors Compliance is good in the fmancial (especially banking), telecommunication and manufacturing sectors. Overall, compliance is better in the private sector (I I percent) than in the public sector (35 percent). As of March 1999, compliance by sector was as follows: fmance 80 percent, utilities 67 percent, telecommunications 64 percent, transportation 61 percent, health care 5 I percent, and government 46 percent. Due to time and budget limitations, however, it is already too late for some sectors to comply and the focus is increasingly on contingency plans. The Commission is currently working on a national contingency plan, which will include plans for difTerent possible scenarios of failure for each sector. Ptiicular emphasis will be given to the utilities sector, health care, and transportation (especially the airline industry). V. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK 52. The medium-term outlook hinges on implementation of the policies outlined in the program. Staff and authorities agreed on the broad outlook and reform objectives (Annex V and Table 11). The thrust of policies remains to raise domestic savings; maintain low inflation; strengthen the financial sector; address the key public sector reform issues; and reduce poverty. 53. A key medium-term policy goal is a sizable increase in public savings (by 4 percent of GNP), through a stronger revenue effort and a shift from current to capital expenditures. With GDP growth rising to 5 percent over the medium term, and fiscal reforms as outlined in the program (fil2), the fiscal deficit would decline steadily to balance by 2004. This would entail a reduction in public debt to below 60 percent by 2004. 54. The external current account is projected to move from a surplus of 2 percent of GNP in 1999 to a deficit of 2-3 percent of GNP over the medium term. Imports are expected to rebound as the recovery gathers momentum. Exports should continue to do well, helped by ongoing trade liberalization and the coming-on-stream of investments in export industries. Analytical work by the stafT(Annex VI)‘* indicates that the equilibrium current account balance for the Philippines may be around 2-3 percent of GNP, and that the peso is currently close to equilibrium. The authorities broadly agreed with this assessment. Private capital inflows are expected to pick up as the region recovers from the crisis, allowing official ‘*The analysis is based on the methodology developed by the Coordinating Group on Exchange Rates (CGER), using staff estimates of the relevant elasticities.

Overall, this should allow a substantial buildup of reserves (to well over twice the current level by 2004) while external debt would fall slightly to below 70 percent of GNP VI. PROGRAM MONITORING 55. All performance criteria for March were met except the ceiling for the PSFR, for which a waiver has been requested (Table 15). Data for the end-June performance criteria will not be available by the time of the Board meeting, and it is proposed that the applicability of the end-June performance criteria be waived for the purchase associated with this review. The authorities have also requested a modification of the end-June ceiling for the PSFR. Performance criteria to be established at this review relate to end-September 1999 and end-December 1999 (SMEFP, Annex I, A-E). VTI. STAFFAPPRAISAL 56. Recent macroeconomic developments have been favorable. External adjustment is proceeding, inflation is coming down, and economic growth has started to recover. Thus, the Philippines has been able to weather the regional crisis relatively well. Better starting conditions than in the most heavily affected countries as well as sound crisis management policies have contributed to this outcome. That the Philippines was better prepared on the eve of the crisis is attributable to the comprehensive reforms under way since the late 1980s and intensified in the 1990s. Successf?rl crisis management involved, in particular, early adaptation of policies (including the floating of the peso, tightening of monetary policy, and measures to strengthen the banking system) followed by gradual relaxation of fiscal and monetary policies as stabilization took hold. The continuity of policies through the transition to a new government has been a significant achievement, although progress with structural reforms has been mixed. 57. Macroeconomic policies are now well supportive of recovery, while external and domestic vulnerabilities are being addressed. Fiscal policy, which was relaxed at the last review, is set to maintain its programmed stance during 1999 with an overall deficit target of 3.2 percent of GNP in 1999. Interest rates have been reduced gradually and are now below pre-crisis levels. At the same time, the peso has strengthened and usable reserves have risen to well above the level of external short-term debt. Banking reforms are inducing the desired private-sector-led strengthening of bank balance sheets. The staff supports the thrust of these policies, embodied in the government’s economic program for 1999. 58. With monetary and fiscal policies shifted to support domestic demand, the focus should now be on implementing the programmed structural reforms. While some easing of the macro-stance can be envisaged in the period ahead, caution will be necessary to avoid undermining the hard-won stabilization gains. At the same time, forceml implementation Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - of key structural reforms is necessary to address the underlying vulnerabilities revealed by the crisis and to provide the basis for sustained rapid growth over the medium term. 59. The government’s overall fiscal targets are appropriate, although the staff continues to he concerned about weak budget revenues. Enhancing the revenue effort remains crucial, with the action plan to strengthen tax administration yet to yield tangible results. The stafftherefore welcomes the intention to reinvigorate the BIR’s reform strategy. On the legislative side, the staff urges early adoption of planned financial sector tax reforms (with broadly neutral impact on overall revenues); rationalization of fiscal incentives; and the revenue measures currently before Congress. In view of the actions to contain the fiscal deficit within the program target, strengthen the medium-term revenue effort, and reverse the slippage in the GOCCs, the staff supports the authorities’ request for a waiver and modification of, respectively, the end-March and end-June ceilings on the PSFR. 60. The staff encourages early implementation of the planned budget and other public sector reforms, with World Bank assistance. The agenda includes the medium-term budget framework, improved expenditure control and monitoring, reform of the central government bureaucracy, and a review of inter-governmental relations. The reforms are critical to permit the desired shift in budget expenditure toward infrastructure and social priorities, and to support the necessary medium-term fiscal consolidation. 61. The deterioration in the finances of GOCCs is of concern, although part of it may be attributable to the economic slowdown. The continued delays in reforming the NPC are a particular worry. While the power tariff increase is an important stop-gap measure, rehabilitating the NPC is a complex task requiring, first and foremost, Congressional passage of the Omnibus Electricity Bill. The staff urges early passage of this bill, followed by accelerated reform and privatization of the NPC. Progress with these reforms will constitute an important element in whether to recommend completion of the next review. In another area, the staff cautions strongly against the new initiative to finance agricultural investment or lending through the NDC. This initiative adds unprogrammed deficit spending, risks further weakening the finances of the NDC, and is a step back into government involvement in financial intermediation (a major problem in the past). The staffwelcomes the authorities’ commitment to caretirlly circumscribe and supervise this program, and to limit it to no more than P 5 billion. 62. Monetary policy through the crisis has been appropriate; as the crisis subsides, the monetary framework will need to evolve as well. Further reductions of interest rates should, as in the past, be conditioned on continued disinflation and peso stability. Staff encourages the BSP to continuously review the monetary framework to ensure that policy is conducted with a clear objective and in a consistent and transparent manner. The exchange rate of the peso is estimated currently to be around its medium-term equilibrium level. Within the floating exchange rate system, the staiTsupports the policy intention over the next few months to build up reserves and maintain relatively easy monetary conditions. Once a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - comfortable reserve position is reached and the recovery is well established, the staff would advise greater exchange rate flexibility, including to help deal with volatile capital flows. Noting the importance of a sound financial basis for the monetary authority, the staITsupports the restoration of tax exempt status for the BSP’s monetary operations. 63. Banking reforms are largely on track, and while banks remain under pressure, the situation appears under control and may be bottoming out. The strategy adopted in early 1998 is working as prudential and supervisory standards have been raised, and weak banks are receiving fresh capital, seeking merger partners, or downgrading their licenses. The staff encourages the BSP to continue with this strategy, forcefully implementing the prudential framework. In this regard, staRwould urge an early review of the recently granted exemption from the general provisioning requirement, Staff supports the financial sector tax reforms and the plan to introduce them in a broadly revenue-neutral manner. In this context, staKwould urge early introduction of tax deductibility of specific loan-loss provisions as well as an increase in taxation of interest income from foreign currency deposits. Staff would also reiterate the need to bring supervisors within the perimeter of the bank secrecy law. The staff supports the government’s intention to privatize PNB by mid-2000, at the latest, and looks forward to seeing a more specific action plan toward that goal. 64. Although the expected recovery will take some pressure off the corporate sector, the opportunity for important reforms in that sector should not be missed. In particular, the debt resolution framework needs both immediate remedy and a sustainable longer-term framework under a new bankruptcy law. 65. The staff supports continued trade and investment liberalization. The recent tariff increases will lapse at end-1999, allowing average tariffs to decline to about 8 percent in 2000. This objective should now be maintained. The staff also welcomes the plans to liberalize investment in the retail sector and to allow 100 percent foreign ownership of distressed banks. 66. The social impact of the recent economic downturn appears to have been softened by government intervention and social support through informal channels. Even so, the crisis has highlighted the need to improve the effectiveness of social programs. The staff strongly supports the authorities’ plans to improve the targeting and efficiency of those programs, in close collaboration with the World Bank. 67. The quality of Philippine statistics has improved in recent years, although some balance of payments data remain weak. The staffwelcomes the enhanced monitoring of external sector developments and vulnerabilities. Further progress is needed to improve the estimates of transactions through FCDU accounts, currently clouded by bank secrecy. 68. With the worst of the Asian crisis now over, for the recovery to be sustained it is critical that the government tackle its structural reform agenda with the same vigor it has applied to stabilizing the economy. In this context, the staff notes the large number Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - of draft laws pending in Congress on various structural reforms. While the staff welcomes the government’s initiative in proposing these laws, the reforms cannot be implemented unless Congress acts on them. As in the past, successful growth-oriented economic policies require executive leadership and broad political support, and the staff looks forward to the necessary consensus that will permit those reforms to go forward. 69. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Philippines be held on the standard 12-month cycle. .

In January 1997, an expert from STA conducted a follow-up to the January 1995 mission, focusing on the clarification and coverage of foreign currency transactions. An STA mission in May 1998 reviewed external debt and balance of payments statistics, and one in May-June 1999 reviewed money and banking statistics. A PDR/STA mission in April 1999 worked on improving short-term debt monitoring systems. Four FAD missions visited Manila between 1992 and mid-1994.

A joint FAD/World Bank mission to review the scope for integrating macroeconomics and the environment was conducted in April 1996. An FAD mission provided advice on the tax treatment of the financial sector in January 1997 and on tax administration in January 1998; follow-up tax administration missions were conducted in March, May, August, November 1998, and April 1999. In April 1999, an FAD mission provided advice on expenditure control and budget system reform. LEG provided assistance in drafting the tax reform legislation in May 1997 as well as in drafting legislation on a minimum business tax. A BCS mission visited Manila in December 1998 to assess the current status of information technology (IT) development and requirements for additional technical assistance relating to implementation of an economic time series database system. xl.

The staffs medium-term scenario assumes successful implementation of the 1999-2000 program, and continued sound policies thereafter. This should permit rapid growth over the medium term, with low inflation and macroeconomic stability. 2. Output is expected to recover in 1999. Real GDP, after falling 0.5 percent in 1998, is projected to grow by 2.2 percent in 1999, reflecting a strong turn-around in agriculture, a bottoming-out in the industrial sector, and continued growth in the services sector. On the demand side, growth is expected to be driven by exports and a boost to government expenditures in late 1998&early 1999. 3. Growth is projected to rise to 5 percent over the medium term. Underlying the pickup is a projected increase in investment to about 25 percent of GNP in 2004. Private investment should recover with the abatement of the regional crisis, and as market-oriented reforms continue and expand. At the same time, public investment is to increase as programmed fiscal reforms take place and the government’s medium-term development priorities are realized. Although potential output growth is currently estimated at around 4 percent, further market-oriented reforms (especially trade liberalization), investment in infrastructure development, macroeconomic stability, improved governance, and modernization of agriculture should be able to increase that potential’ Well-targeted social policies and investment in human capital would aim at a more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth. 4. National saving as a share of GNP is projected to increase to 22 percent by 2004. Private saving rose sharply during the recent crisis and may be expected to fall back somewhat, although not to pre-crisis levels. Higher public saving is to derive from the various reforms that are on the government’s agenda, including better tax administration, civil service reform, review of local government finances, and expenditure reforms. To prevent private saving from falling back fully to pre-crisis levels, the underlying propensity to save must rise. Key factors in this regard are a projected decline in the dependency ratio (currently estimated at around 70 percent), further financial sector development, planned reforms to the pension system, and higher real incomes (especially among the poor) 5. Annual inflation is targeted to decline to about 5 percent over the medium term. After increasing to 9.7 percent in 1998 (driven by high food prices because of bad weather), inflation had fallen 7 percent in May 1999 as a result of stabilizing food prices, the impact of peso stability, and weak demand conditions. The medium-term target of 5 percent is to be supported by sound fiscal and monetary policies, as well as further deregulation and liberalization of the economy. ‘For a more detailed analysis of the factors contributing to output growth, see Chapter II of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 67 - 6. The medium-term fiscal program aims at reducing public debt to below two- thirds of GNP over the next live years. The national government deficit is targeted to narrow from 2.7 percent of GNP in 1999 to balance in 2004. I. Revenue as a share of GNP is projected to recover to its 1997 level over the medium term. The revenue ratio declined from 18.6 percent of GNP in 1997 to 16.7 percent of GNP in 1998, reflecting the impact of the Asian crisis and tariff reductions, as well as weak tax administration and the proliferation of exemptions. Consequently, the targeted recovery is premised principally on strengthening tax administration, rationalization of tax incentives, and the recovery of output growth. Some tax measures may in addition be necessary, although the current level and structure of taxes is broadly appropriate. Tariff reductions will continue over the medium term 8 Expenditures as a share of GNP are projected to decline over the medium term, with the structure shifting toward capital outlays and social safety net priorities. The planned streamlining and reform of the central government bureaucracy is key to this objective, as is the pending review of local government finances. Ongoing reforms to the budget process are to deliver a more rational and cost-effective allocation of resources, and the targeting and delivery of social expenditures are to be strengthened, with World Bank assistance. 9. The external position is projected to strengthen further, with the current account returning to a moderate deticit while capital inflows recover as well. In 1998, the current account moved from a deficit of 5 percent of GNP to a surplus of about 2 percent. Underlying the improvement in the current account was a large turnaround in the trade account from a deficit of 13 percent of GNP in 1997 to balance in 1998, reflecting mainly the effects of part peso depreciation and the slowdown in economic activity. Over the medium term, as imports rebound with the recovery, the current account is projected to move back into a deficit of 2% percent of GNP, and the trade account to a deficit of about 4% percent of GNP A full return to earlier deficit levels should not occur because part of the recent depreciation is assumed to “stick” (correcting previous over-valuation), and there appears also to be a structural improvement in competitiveness.2 IO. The debt-service ratio is projected to decline to below 13 percent over the medium term, as a result of recent improvement in the current account and continued strong export growth. Official reserves are projected to double to over $29 billion by 2004, which should allow a further substantial rise in the ratio of reserves to short-term debt (currently at about 120 percent). *For more detailed analysis, see Section V of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper. - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 68 - ANNEX VI Staff analysis of external competitiveness’ suggests that the exchange rate of the peso is currently close to its medium-term equilibrium value. The current account balance was above a medium-term savings-investment norm during 1998 primarily because the economy fell into recession and the exchange rate became temporarily undervalued following the Asian crisis. However, the peso has appreciated significantly in real effective terms during 1999, eliminating virtually all of the estimated undervaluation. A. External Competitiveness Indicators Because of recent volatility, and some data limitations, analysis of competitiveness indicators provides limited evidence regarding the equilibrium exchange rate. Figure 1, top panel presents the ratio of the price of nonfood items to the price of food, a proxy for the internal exchange rate. This measure clearly captures the rise in the real exchange rate prior to the Asian crisis. However, probably affected by transitory weather conditions, it does not capture the large depreciation since the mid-1997 floating of the peso. The real effective exchange rate index (REER) better captures the significant appreciation prior to the crisis, and the large depreciation since mid-1997. Figure 1, bottom panel shows appreciation of more than 50 percent from the trough in late 1990, followed by depreciation of about 30 percent. The issue then is to determine a reasonable base period during which the economy is judged to have been in broad external equilibrium. Comparison with regional competitors shows greater real appreciation of the peso prior to the crisis followed by similar depreciation (except for the steeper fall of the Indonesian rupiah-Figure 2). Again, the fact that the REER in the Philippines is now more appreciated than in the other ASEAN- does not mean necessarily that the peso is now overvalued. For such an assessment, a benchmark is necessary that judges the exchange rate relative to economic fundamentals. B. Applying the “CGER” Methodology to the Philippine? A current account benchmark can be estimated for the Philippines on the basis of demographic, fiscal, and relative income data. The CGER methodology constructs current account benchmarks (savings-investment norms) by comparing country-specific variables ‘A more detailed presentation is provided in Chapter V of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper. *The methodology was developed by the Coordinating Group on Exchange Rates (CGER) in the IMF, and is described in greater detail in Occasional Paper No. 167, “Exchange Rate Assessment,” 1998. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-69- relative to a set of industrial country averages in the context of an econometrically derived equation. The relevant variables include: . The fiscal deficit compared to the average in the sample . The dependency ratio, which is higher for the Philippines than the sample mean (but lower than in Indonesia). . Per capita income (measured as a percent of the U.S. per capita income, using PPP weights). For the Philippines, this variable is low relative to other ASEAN economies. The methodology results in a savings-investment norm of -2.5 percent of GDP for 1998.’ This is consistent with the view that developing countries would normally be expected to run a (moderate) current account deficit given the relatively high real returns to investing there. The next step in the CGER methodology is to compute the exchange rate adjustment that would be required in order to bring the current account (corrected for cyclical effects and after allowing lags) to the savings-investment norm. Two important elasticities are required: . the change in the current account as a result of the change in cyclical conditions (measured by the output gap); this allows estimation of a cyclically adjusted current account; and . the change in the current account as a result of change in the exchange rate. The approach taken here is to estimate a simple reduced-form regression that provides the needed elasticities directly. The following equation was estimated for the period 1982-98 (t-statistics in parentheses): CA-Y,=-2.52-O.lS*R,-O.l3*R,., -057*YGAP,, o,=1.97,D.W.=2.04,R2-BAR=0.62. (4.83) (2.88) (2.33) (2.97) The current account balance (CA-Y) is measured as a percent of GDP, R denotes the logarithmic change in the REER, and YGAP denotes the output gap.4 ‘More precisely, the methodology results in a savings-investment norm of -1.3 percent of GDP. However, the methodology allows for the addition of a “fixed effect” term, which adjusts the average norm so that it matches the sample mean for the period 1982-93 (earlier data are used so as not to allow the effect of the Asian crisis to influence the estimate). ‘As estimated using a Hodrick-Prescott filter. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 70 - Using the estimated elasticities, it is possible to compute the required adjustment in the exchange rate that would bring the cyclically adjusted current account in line with the savings-investment norm. Figure 3 plots the results, showing the actual and cyclically adjusted current accounts in the Philippines, together with the implied annual overvaluation/undervaluation of the exchange rate. As Figure 3 shows, the equation has good explanatory power, and captures rather well the dramatic turnaround in the current account from 1997 to 1998. The key conclusions from this analysis are that: . During the period 1993-97, the current account was in sizable deficit, and the peso was overvalued by between 10-20 percent. The Philippine real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated faster than in other ASEAN countries, and the current account deficit was at times significantly higher than implied by the medium- term savings-investment norm even after accounting for the impact of the economic cycle. . In 199~the first full year following the Asian crisis--the current account adjusted rapidly and the exchange rate overshot, the peso becoming undervalued by between lo-15 percent in real effective terms. The current account reached a surplus of 1.8 percent of GNP, in contrast to a deficit implied by the savings-investment norm. . During 1999 so far, the RICER appreciated by 10.7 percent’ and, assuming an unchanged REER from now on, the REER will appreciate by 12.9 percent on a full year basis. This implies that the undervaluation has been essentially eliminated and that the REER will remain around its medium-term equilibrium level. While these estimates indicate that the peso is close to an equilibrium level implied by medium-term fundamentals, a number of caveats apply. The estimation of the savings- investment norm applies methodology originally developed for industrial countries-although the results appear reasonable. The elasticities are derived using reduced-form equations, and may under-state the sensitivity of the current account to a rebound of growth. Estimates of the current account deficit in the Philippines are affected by considerable uncertainty about transactions through FCDU accounts (see Annex XI). And finally, there are several risks to the outlook assumed for the external environment (the vulnerability of Philippine exports to developments in the U.S.-a high share of Philippine exports are directed toward the U.S.; the outlook for Japan; and more generally the risk of a renewed downturn of regional markets). ‘Comparing the average REER during the first five months of 1999 with the average REER during 1998.

The banking sector reform strategy adopted in early 1998 relied on a market-based approach to individual problem banks, buttressed by a comprehensive strengthening of prudential and supervisory standards. Capitalization of banks would be increased and other prudential norms tightened, to enhance banks’ ability to meet the pressures associated with the regional crisis. A separate resolution strategy was adopted for the Philippine National Bank (PNB), the only large problem bank. Supervisory resources were to be upgraded and focused on problem institutions, and a contingency “worst-case” action plan was to be elaborated. Simultaneously, actions would be taken enhance transparency and improve corporate governance of banks. The reforms were supported by a Banking Sector Reform Loan (BSRL) from the World Bank (approved in December 1998). 2. The reforms in the banking area formed part of a comprehensive program of economic adjustment and structural reforms supported by the current stand-by arrangement. Under this program, policies were designed to stabilize the economy, reduce external vulnerabilities, and provide for an early recovery to sustainable rapid growth. The anticipated stabilization of the peso and reduction in interest rates was also expected to ease pressure on the corporate and banking sectors. II. CURRENT SITUATION OF BANKING SYSTEM 3. The financial condition of the Philippine banks deteriorated throughout 1998, and indications are that the situation has yet to bottom out. While a substantial worsening had been anticipated, the extent of the pressure on banks has exceeded early expectations. In part, this reflects the overall weakness of the economy. However, the delay in implementing tax deductibility of specific loan loss provisions, an important part of the strategy, has aggravated the impact of tighter provisioning requirements and reduced banks’ ability to accumulate capital out of profits. Banks’ recourse to the BSP emergency lending facility reached a peak of P 14.3 billion at end-May 1998 (up from P 4% billion at end-l 997) and has fluctuated within a narrow range since then. Prudential indicators 4. Nonperforming loans (NPL) have increased from under 4 percent of total loans before the crisis to 11 percent at end-1998, and 13.1 percent in March 1999. Nonperforming assets (including restructured loans and foreclosed assets) increased from 16.9 percent of total assets at end-1998 to 20 percent in February 1999.’ Real estate loans as a proportion of the total portfolio have remained fairly constant, at around 13 percent, over the last year. The worsening of some prudential indicators over the past two years reflects ‘Foreclosed assets (collateral and other real properties acquired by banks in lieu of payment) may in part represent problem loans as it is not clear whether such assets have been conservatively valued or in fact can be realized.

While classified assets increased sharply in recent years, the tightening of loan- loss provision requirements was building a cushion in case such assets eventually had to be written om. 6. While the system average for nonperforming loans is expected to peak at about 15 percent by mid-1999, the authorities believe that the NPL problem for the largest banks, Expanded Commercial Banks (Ems) has peaked. The Non-expanded Commercial Banks (NEKBs) and thrift banks are expected to continue to experience difftculties as their borrowers continue to be more adversely affected by the slow pace of economic recovery. 7. Capital Adequacy Ratios (CAR) at end-1998 averaged 17% percent, up from 16 percent at end-1997 and well above the 10 percent level required. The improvement reflected mainly a shift in banks’ portfolios to zero-risk-weighted assets in addition to the higher level of capital. One EKB and one NFKB fell below the IO percent regulatory CAR as ofend-1998. 8. A number of institutions failed to meet the higher minimum capital requirement at end-1998, although those not in compliance accounted for a relatively small percentage of total bank assets (Table 3). Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with all banks that are currently in noncompliance with minimum capital at end-1998 have been issued by BSP. The MOUs include action plans to ensure that banks will be brought into compliance with the higher capital requirements that will be phased in at end-1999 and end-2000.

Stress tests undertaken by the BSP indicate that only two additional NEKBs that are now in compliance with minimum capital requirements will likely have difficulties in meeting the higher minimum capital requirements scheduled to come into effect at end-1999. Corporate soundness indicators IO. The number of companies seeking protection from creditors (“suspension of payments”) under the auspices of the SEC has slowed in recent months, suggesting that the ability of borrowers to repay debts has stabilized (see Annex VIII). While during the first three quarters of 1998, an average of 10 cases per quarter were filed, the number of filings dropped in the final quarter to 4 and remained at this level in the first quarter of 1999. Corrective supervisory action II. BSP has moved forcefully to take corrective action with respect to banks that are not in regulatory- compliance. Banks in violation of prudential norms have been subject to sanctions, following a new matrix of corrective actions issued in 1998. As noted, capital deficient banks have been required to agree on MOUs with the BSP. MOUs typically include restrictions on bank operations until the bank is in compliance. Two capital deficient EKBs have agreed to merge; and one will merge with a NEKJ% Four NEKBs are at advanced stages of merger discussions. Two other NEKB have raised the required minimum capital, in one instance through an IPO. The remaining capital deficient NEKB has also eliminated its capital deficiency through fresh capital infusion and collecting on adversely classified assets. Nineteen thrift banks are seeking downgrades in their licenses and 22 have indicated that their shareholders will be infUsing new capital; discussions are continuing with the remaining capital deficient thrifts. With respect to the rural banks, all capital deficient banks (about 200) have been issued MOUs and 130 have signed. 12. The authorities reconfirmed their intention to fully privatize PNB by mid-2000 at the latest; meanwhile the bank is moving to recover from its difficulties. PNB is the only large bank in serious financial difficulties following a series of large corporate loan defaults. In early 1999, provisions of P 8.9 billion (about 7 percent of the loan book) were constituted retroactively for 1998; obsolete information systems were written off; the cost of unfunded pensions and retrenchment packages were explicitly allowed for; and capital was written down from P 22 billion to about P15 billion, reducing the CAR to about half the required 10 percent. Management of the bank has indicated its intention to remedy the capital shortfall through the sale of undervalued assets (including its headquarters building) and a rights issue. An external audit of the bank is to be completed by end-July, which will be the basis for an action plan toward sale of the remaining block of government-owned or controlled shares (46 percent) in early 2000.* 13. In October 1998, the Orient Bank, a small commercial bank that declared a “bank holiday” in February 1998, was formally placed under receivership of the *Loan covenants under some outstanding floating-rate note certificates (FRNCs) of the bank prohibit the sale of government shares prior to March 2000.

A resolution strategy is being developed that would involve the transfer of the remaining deposits and good assets to another bank, A possible funding gap (beyond deposits covered by the PDIC)’ would be covered by the BSP and/or the PDIC. In the meantime, the bank remains closed and the owners have lost their equity stakes. III. WLEMEPITATI~NPR~G~SS 14. Implementation of the strategy has been broadly on track. As described above, banks are seeking market-based solutions to capital deficiencies. Corrective supervisory action, supported by appropriate sanctions, has encouraged the pace of resolution. Nevertheless, the authorities have been concerned about the slower pace of recovery than initially envisaged, and about the adverse impact of the tighter regulatory framework on banks’ willingness to lend. Consequently, they have eased certain regulations to encourage bank mergers, loan restructuring, and the extension of new bank credit. Enhance banks ability to withstand shocks IS. Minimum capital and provisioning requirements have been raised in line with the schedule under the program. Loan classification and provisioning requirements have been tightened, with revised definitions of “overdue loans”, new specific provisions for “specially mentioned’ and for collateralized substandard loans, and a new general provision (gradually increasing to 2 percent by October 1, 1999). In particular, the definition of “past due” loans was tightened, reducing the number of allowable installments in arrears from 6 to 2 for loans payable in monthly installments, and from 3 to I for quarterly installments, respectively. The classification of restructured loans was tightened including by requiring that loan collateral be re-evaluated; and prudential limits related to the allowable valuation of real estate collateral were tightened from 70 percent of appraised value to 60 percent. 16. Etfective April 1999, the stock of bank loans in excess of the level outstanding at end-March 1999 was exempted from the general provisioning requirements (as a step to encourage new lending). The authorities indicated that the latter measure was partly motivated by the relatively high level of the general provision requirement in the Philippines (Table 5) and that the amount of general provisioning would be comprehensively reviewed once credit growth had recovered. ‘The authorities indicated that failure to pay out a number of large (uninsured) deposits (such as deposits of a university) may have adverse social consequences.

In particular, a framework of “prompt” corrective actions vis-a-vis capital-deficient banks has been established; the process of closing failed banks has been streamlined; and draft legislation has been submitted to Congress that would allow for fidl foreign ownership of distressed banks.’ Furthermore, the BSP has clarified that in the case of bank failure, owners would lose their equity stake and be prohibited from being involved with the rehabilitated bank Supervisory@amework 18. Supervisory resources and skills are being upgraded and concentrated on larger potential problem banks. Special audits of identified problem banks were initiated and IO such audits of commercial banks were completed during 1998. Additionally, the BSP has used “roving examiners” to check compliance with specific regulations. Supervisory staff is being augmented by new hires, and stafftraining is ongoing, especially on risk-based supervision with technical assistance from the World Bank, USAlD, and the IMP 19. Early warning indicators are being enhanced to help prevent failures, and contingency plans developed to deal effectively with inevitable failures. The CAMEL rating has been expanded to include “sensitivity to market risk” (to “CAMELS”), and the authorities’ continue to improve the rating methodology. A “worst-case” contingency plan has been drafted by the BSP that sets forth the guiding principles for resolving individual problem banks as well as action in the event of a systemic crisis. “The proposal, however, calls for the foreign equity stake to be reduced gradually to 70 percent over a IO-year period. However, an amendment has recently been submitted that- would allow Ml foreign ownership of all banks, subject to a maximum overall share of Philippine banks’ capital in foreign hands.

In particular, draft amendments to banking legislation submitted to Congress would: provide a legal basis for consolidated supervision; facilitate the ability of supervisors to conduct fi~ll on-site inspections; provide for legal protection of supervisors in the conduct of their duties; reduce the time line for problem bank resolution; raise statutory tines and penalties for noncompliance with prudential regulations; specify the conditions for access to BSP lender-of-last resort facilities; and limit banks’ investments in equities of allied and non-allied enterprises. 21. As a result of these efforts, the Philippines has come much closer to the Basle Core Principles. The main issue that puts the Philippines’ regulatory framework at variance with Basle Core Principles is the Bank Secrecy Law. Notwithstanding its exemptions, this law precludes access of supervisors to critical information about a bank’s deposit base (see also EBS/98/172, page 69, and EBS/98/50, page 64). Prudential-based management of cross- border flows is being strengthened as the BSP is adopting a framework for monitoring maturity gaps in foreign exchange and introducing a framework for monitoring short-term foreign debt exposures. The existing limits on foreign exchange positions should also help in this regard. Transparency 22. A number of measures have been taken to enhance transparency in the system. For listed banks, quantitative information on the level of nonperforming loans, classified assets, and specific provisions is now required to be published quarterly; daily reports on the range of lending and deposit interest rates are also required. External auditors have been placed under an affirmative obligation to inform the BSP of factors that might adversely affect banks, and a system of accreditation of external auditors is under discussion. Market-based approach to resolution 23. A number of incentives have been provided to encourage mergers, including the phased compliance with some regulatory norms. In particular, the staggered booking of provisions has been allowed for merged institutions (over a five-year period for specific provisions, and over a three-year period for general provisions).5 Merged institutions can also revalue fixed assets without capital gains taxation, with the consequence that undervalued assets can be rebooked and the revaluation gains counted toward capital (in accordance with the Basle Capital Accord). ‘The specific profile for compliance over these periods is to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the BSP. Specific provisions already taken by banks prior to the merger cannot be unwound, and loans granted after the date of merger are subject to the normal classification and provisioning rules. A limit to the amount of provisions that can be staggered is set in the case of mergers of banks from different bank categories (e.g., a rural bank and an NEKB), b_ut not in the case of mergers within a banking class (e.g., two EKB banks).

This annex focuses on the Philippine budget system and outlines the next steps in medium- term budgeting reform. It also addresses the shorter-term issue of expenditure arrears and measures to improve expenditure control. A. Key Characteristics of the Budget System 2. The budget system in the Philippines is somewhat disjointed. Budget preparation and execution (residing with Department of Budget and Management, DBM) is institutionally separated from cash and debt management (Bureau of the Treasury, BTr), fiscal policy and tax revenues (Department of Finance, DOF), and consolidation of the government’s annual accounts (the Commission of Audit, COA). The National Economic Development Agency (NEDA) provides the macroeconomic framework for the budget, appraises major government projects, and evaluates their overall performance. 3. Despite this institutional structure, the authorities have generally been successful in ensuring that agencies have adjusted budgetary expenditures to meet overall macro stabilization targets. This has been accomplished by an effective system of interagency committees, reinforced by an informal system of personal contacts, which have achieved significant coordination in fiscal policy. 4. Unlike in many countries, the budget system is based on obligations rather than cash accounting. The obligations system in the Philippines is based on the principle that once the legislature gives an agency the authority to spend (i.e., approves the budget), the agency has the authority to commit (or obligate) against its appropriation with the presumption that when the bills come due there will be adequate cash resources to meet these bills. Implicitly, the system assumes a degree of economic stability and ease in raising resources for the government. 5. Due to problems in cash availability, the DBM has often had to restrict the right of agencies to commit, usually by releasing allotments in a staggered way through the year to try to match the speed of budget execution with cash availability. The control over expenditure commitments has usually been adequate to prevent expenditure arrears from building up. However, beginning in late 1997, there was an increase in accounts payable, a portion ofwhich were genuine expenditure arrears (i.e., bills for goods and services that had been delivered but for which payment had not been made according to contractual arrangements). B. The Origins of Budget Reform and Arrears 6. Budget reform in the Philippines has consisted of a gradual, pragmatic approach rather than large, one-off initiatives. The first steps in budget management reforms were taken after the accession of the Aquino government in 1986. A key step was the streamlining of the allotment system in 1986 by the introduction of a common fund. This broke the rigid Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-’ 87 - connection between allotments and individual spending activities. As a result, agencies could better shift finance during the course of the year from slow-moving activities to those better able to utilise available funding. There was, at the same time, a significant decentralization of budget execution to regional of&es of the DBM and spending agencies, to encourage a “bottom-up” input into budget preparation. 7. By the mid-1990s, however, it was evident that the control system geared toward achieving overall macro/fiscal targets was adversely affecting the efftciency and effectiveness of resource allocation. The control system took three main forms: (9 Continued micro-management of the pattern of spending by budget agencies, with budget allocations taking the form of multiple separate line items for activities and projects. This straitjacket on line items limited the ability of agencies to assign funds to their most productive uses. (ii) The DBM imposed a control over commitments that could be entered into by each agency, through the partial release of appropriations (allotments) during the course of the budget year in light of the evolving revenue situation. (iii) Superimposed on the allotment controls was a system of monthly cash allocations made by the DBM to each agency. The system was intended to ensure that checks would not be written by the agency unless cash was available to honor them. 8. While this system generally ensured effective fiscal control at the macro level, this often came at a high price in terms of operational tlexibility and efftciency in managing spending activities. In addition, the double system of control-over both allotments and cash allocations-proved inadequate to prevent the accumulation of unpaid bills in spending agencies. During 1998, budgetary arrears arose mainly because of the shortfall in revenue yrelative to budgetary projections) that began in late 1997. The revenue shortfall, which eventually reached about 2 percent of GNP, was caused by the crisis-related slowdown of economic activity as well as failure to adopt tax measures included in budget estimates. In response, the government in early 1998 imposed a 25 percent across-the-board reserve on all nonwage and non-interest budget appropriations. As agencies could not slow down their commitments accordingly, accounts payable rose significantly during 1998.’ ‘As explained below, the Philippines budget accounting system does not allow estimation of “arrears” or “accounts payable” with regularity and precision. An ad-hoc effort in early 1999 indicated that accounts payable at end-1998 had risen to B 137 billion (from P 127 billion estimated at end-1997), but that only a portion of those (P 58 billion) related to commitments from 1997-98, and an even smaller portion (P 4 billion) was actually in %rrears” (“due and demandable”) at end-1998. These estimates would indicate that at least a significant part of (continued., .) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 88 - 10. Concerning accounting, the obligations-based accounting framework does not allow genuine expenditure arrears to be identified within “accounts payable”. As COA has repeatedly noted in its Annual Financial Report, the major item in “accounts payable” is unliquidated obligations. In most instances, these do not correspond to government payment liabilities and instead of being removed from the books of accounts after two years, they remain on the books for long periods of time, thereby bloating the stock of accounts payable. c Current Directions of Medium-Term Budgei Reform 11. Since the early 199Os, the pace of budget system reform has accelerated. DBM has comprehensively reviewed budgeting practices in other countries and is attempting to develop processes which will provide a more effective trade-off between the still- pressing need for short-term macrofiscal control and the desirability of more effective management of public expenditures by individual spending agencies. Three main directions of change in the Philippine budget process now emerging are: (0 More flexibility for spending agencies in the use of their budget allocations. To this end, budget execution in 1999 involves the up-front release of 80 percent of appropriations to spending agencies, dispensing with the past system of phased allotments throughout the year. This is an important, if controversial, step toward the eventual abandonment of the allotment system for controlling commitments and the devolution of the management of the commitments side of the budget process to spending agencies. A &rther development in the 1999 budget that will increase the flexibility with which line agencies can manage is the introduction of greater freedom for program managers to transfer funds between objects of expenditure. (ii) Provision of a more certain operating environment for agencies. In regard to encouraging short-term agency management, this has been achieved through the decision to move from monthly to quarterly cash allocations in the 1999 budget. This enables agencies to plan their disbursements three months in advance. In regard to longer-term planning, the planned introduction of a medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) by the year 2000 is to provide agencies with a more certain environment for planning their capital expenditures as well as spending on operations and maintenance. The MTEF will also give the DBM a key strategic tool for expenditure management in the medium term. This is both at the micro-management level, by facilitating the inclusion of performance information in medium-term budget planning, and at the macro level, by exerting pressure toward cost-effective baseline spending. expenditure restraint in I998 was exercised as the commitment level (and not just through cash-rationing. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 89 - (iii) Pressure on agencies to manage their budgets more economically and effectively. This has taken place through the gradual introduction of output-oriented budgeting. The latter involves the linking of financial allocations contained in the budget to physical targets, allowing the monitoring of achievement of these targets in order to improve budget outcomes. In the first instance, the linking of performance information to budget allocations will be through a new half yearly budget review being introduced in the 1999 budget. The eventual introduction of a. centralized financial management information system, being developed by the DBM and currently at a pilot implementation stage, will also increase the transparency of agency operations during the course of budget execution. 12. It is envisaged that the above three changes will enable agencies to use scarce budget funds more flexibly and effectively, while also putting pressure on them to do so. This should encourage reallocation of funds from less effective to more effective uses with each agency. It will also have advantages for the central agencies, enabling stronger aggregate expenditure control through the ability to identify and more easily withdraw funds from unproductive activities currently hidden in the baseline budget. D. Dealing with Expenditure Arrears 13. Although responsibility in budgetary management is being devolved to spending agencies, the central budget-monitoring agencies still need to retain adequate oversight and appropriate tools so as to prevent the accumulation of new expenditure arrears. At the same time, the stock of “old” arrears needs to be fi~lly identified and liquidated. With regard to the issue of clearing “old” arrears, at the beginning of 1999 DBM began issuing special notices of cash allocations (NCAs) on a monthly basis for the express purpose of clearing accounts which are “due and demandable”. Since the present accounting system cannot isolate genuine arrears within “accounts payable”, the identification of accounts due and demandable, and their prioritization for payment, was to be done by spending agencies. The original 1999 cash budget plan included an amount of p 60 billion to “clear all” accounts payable from 1997-98 that are or become due and demandable during 1999; this amount has been lowered to f 50 billion based on actual settlements during January-May 1999. 14. To rectify accounting deficiencies, COA has agreed to change accounting procedures during 1999. Obligations due for liquidation--the presently unrecorded stage in the expenditure process between commitments and actual payment-will be recorded by every spending agency. Provided that the due payment date is also recorded when this modification is implemented, it should henceforth be possible to identify expenditure arrears and monitor them on a monthly basis. Prior to the adoption of new accounting procedures, it would be desirable to modify the present “accountability” reports prepared by agencies for DBM, so that the stock and age of accounts due and demandable, a close proxy for arrears, is recorded every month. At the same time, non-essenfial monthly reports could be eliminated. These are important first steps to preventing the accumulation of new expenditure arrears. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 90 - 15. Actions in five other areas should prevent the accumulation new arrears. Besides improving reporting systems, the other main measures for avoiding new arrears are: (i) prepare realistic and realizable annual revenue projections; (ii) monitor revenue closely and stand ready with a contingency plan so that measures such as enhancing tax administration, changing tax policies, or cutting expenditure commitments could be taken at short notice should revenue shortfalls emerge; (iii) adopt an Annual Appropriations Act whose expenditures are fully funded; (iv) enhance banking arrangements for inflows into, and outflows from, government accounts held in authorized commercial banks, with a view to reducing bank float (especially the lag between the deposit of revenues and their transfer to the BTr) and minimizing idle balances in the banking system; and (v) improve short-term cash programming by preparing rolling three-month cash plans which would be updated every month. These in turn would require enhanced collaboration between the central agencies, more detailed and reliable data bases for short-term revenue projections, and involvement of spending agencies in the centrally coordinated “rolling” cash plans. In the medium term, as spending agencies’ financial planning capacities improve, it is conceivable that the NCA rationing system could be phased out. However, before this is done, it would be important to establish a track record of an arrears-free budget process. To this end, it is also important to implement the planned computerized government financial information management information system (GFIMS).

I. Real sector Reporting in the framework of Znrernarronal Financ~uZ Srufisrics (IFS) of yearly and quarterly national accounts data is current. A report on the national accounts of the Philippines in 1993 found that, despite an impressive and sophisticated array of tables prepared in a timely fashion, the reliance on sparse source data of dubious quality raised serious questions about the adequacy of the national accounts to measure either short-term movements or structural change. Other ZZ’S reporting of real sector data by the Philippines shows incidental gaps. The reporting of global volume and price indices of merchandise imports and exports was abandoned in 1992. 2. Monetary accounts Data for the central bank, the deposit money banks, and other banking institutions are reported on a regular basis. Data for the central bank and the deposit money banks are reported in the format of analytical accounts (Tables IOG and 20G, respectively), despite requests for the authorities to use revised report forms for the central bank (1OR) and the deposit money banks (20R) that were prepared by STA. As a result, it has not been possible to verify the methodological soundness of the reported data. Over the last decade major structural changes in the financial system have taken place affecting the central bank, the commercial banks, and nonbank financial intermediaries. A mission visited Manila in late May 1999 to review these and other issues; the last such review was in 1988. The mission found that the framework underlying the compilation of the monetary statistics largely conforms with the Fund’s methodology. However, the institutional coverage of the financial accounts needed to be expanded to include thrifts and rural banks as well as off- shore banking units. A framework for compilation of a broader banking survey is being developed by the BSP. This work is being done in conjunction with implementation of improvements in computerization, the timeliness of reporting by rural banks, and revision of reporting by off-shore banking units. Under this framework the broad money and credit agregates would be larger than those currently produced in the monetary survey by IO- I3 percent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 95 .- 3. Balance of payments Since the deregulation of the foreign exchange regime in 1992, the compilation of the balance of payments has become an increasingly difficult task, because of difficulties in accurately recording the growing volume of resident transactions channeled through the Foreign Currency Deposits Units (FCDUs) of domestic banks. Because of the strict secrecy provisions that are attached to these accounts, the authorities are not permitted to conduct inquiries into the nature of the underlying transactions that give rise to increases/decreases in these accounts. As a consequence, various ad-hoc methodologies have been devised to construct estimates of the value and the classification of the balance of payments transactions channeled through FCDUs, none of which have been satisfactory The result has been a weakening in the reliability of current account estimates. The scale of the statistical problem continues to grow as more transactions are channeled through FCDU accounts and through accounts abroad, which are also not captured in the balance of payments statistics. The authorities intend to introduce a number of changes to their statistical collections this year to address the problem, but based on the findings of an STA mission that visited Manila in February 1999, the changes to the reporting system will not provide the required information on transactions channeled through the FCDUs. The mission recommended a number of improvements to the present system and urged the authorities to introduce a closed international transactions reporting system for compiling balance of payments statistics. To ensure significant improvements in this area, it will be necessary to amend legislation to allow BSP to collect data from banks on a confidential basis for statistical purposes, including balance of payments compilation. An international investment position statement is not compiled. However, quarterly external debt statistics are published with broad coverage that includes the private sector. BSP plans to expand the coverage of these statistics with a view to ensuring their correspondence with creditor country sources. In the new format, external debt statistics will include the debt of branches of foreign owned banks, nonresident holdings of domestically issued securities, and the external liabilities of Offshore Banking Units (by treating them as resident). BSP is also converting this database into a monthly database for the internal monitoring of external debt, and plans to integrate into this a high-frequency early warning system of interbank credit lines along the lines proposed by a recent PDRISTA technical assistance mission.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Philippines On July 9, 1999, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Philippines.’ Background In contrast to the countries most heavily affected by the Asian financial crisis, the Philippine economy was able to avoid a severe recession and the disruptions to economic activity experienced elsewhere. This can be attributed to better starting conditions as a result of a decade of reform policies implemented prior to the crisis, as well as sound crisis management including early floating of the peso, adaptation of monetary and fiscal policies, and a comprehensive program to strengthen the banking sector. These policies have been supported by a two-year stand-by arrangement from the IMF approved on April 1, 1998 (upon expiration of the 1994 extended arrangement which had been augmented and extended in mid-1997). Following GDP growth of 5% in 1997, the economy contracted slightly (by ‘/%) in 1998. While non-agricultural output growth remained positive, the effects of the El Nino drought led to a record decline in agriculture of 7%. GDP growth in the first quarter of 1999, at 1.2%, was better than expected, reflecting a rebound in agriculture, continued growth in services, and signs of bottoming out in the industrial sector. For the year as a whole, GDP growth is projected in a range of l-3%, with recent developments suggesting an outcome in the upper half of the range. ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies, On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

Since then, it has declined sharply, to 6.7% as of May and well within the year-end program target of 7’/2%. The external position has strengthened significantly over the past year, reflecting improvements in both the current and the capital accounts. In the first quarter of 1999, the current account recorded a surplus of $1.3 billion, following further improvement in the trade balance. Continued rapid export growth-in contrast to other crisis-affected countries-combined with declining imports led to a sharp turnaround in the trade balance, from a deficit of $11 billion in 1997 to a surplus of $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 1999. The trade surplus is expected to narrow in 1999, as imports pick up due to increased economic activity. Capital inflows are recovering with the restoration of access to foreign financial markets, which has allowed the government already to virtually complete its foreign borrowing program in support of the budget this year; private inflows have also returned in early 1999. As a result, gross adjusted reserves of the Bangko Sentral have risen to $11.6 billion as of the first quarter of 1999, over $3 billion higher than the end-March 1998 level. The turnaround in the external position has significantly reduced the Philippines’ vulnerability to shocks. After five years of consolidation, fiscal policy turned expansionary over the past two years. The consolidated public sector widened from 1% % of GNP in 1997 to around 3% in 1998-99, reflecting mainly weakening revenue collections, a fiscal stimulus package on the expenditure side, and a deterioration in the finances of government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs). The relaxation of fiscal policy reflected mainly the slowdown of economic activity and the government’s efforts to support domestic demand, although delays in planned revenue measures and with reforms in the power sector have also been responsible. The government’s program envisages a return to fiscal consolidation as the economy recovers. For next year, a reduction in the fiscal deficit by 1% of GNP is envisaged, followed by continued consolidation toward balance by 2003-04 This is to be achieved in part through a sustained strengthening of National Government revenue collections and reversal of the recent deterioration in the finances of the GOCCs. Key elements in the governments reform agenda to this end are a major improvement in tax administration and comprehensive restructuring of the National Power Corporation, the largest among the GOCCs. Monetary policy has been eased gradually since late 1998 as the peso stabilized and inflation was successfully contained. Interest rates are now below crisis levels, with liquidity conditions well supportive of the recovery. Even so, monetary and credit aggregates have remained substantially below program ceilings, reflecting weak demand conditions as well as banks’ concerns over bad loans. For the period ahead, the BSP intends to continue with gradual interest rate reductions. conditional on peso stability and inflation remaining on track. In the area of structural reforms, good progress has been made especially in the banking sector. While the banking system remains under stress, as evidenced by the still rising nonperforming loans ratio (13.1% in March 1999) the authorities are confident that the situation Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 103 -- ANNEX XIII is under control given the system’s strong capital base and the expected peaking of NPLs in the near future. Tighter prudential and supervisory standards have been put in place, and are encouraging the intended recapitalization of weaker banks through capital infusions or mergers with stronger banks. The rehabilitation and full privatization of the Philippine National Bank is proceeding, with a view to completion by mid-2000, at the latest. Reforms in other areas (corporate sector, trade and investment liberalization, and improvements to economic statistics and their publication) are continuing, and the government is embarking on a comprehensive set of public sector reforms, with World Bank assistance. The Action Plan to improve tax administration, an important program element developed with IMF technical assistance, has proven more difficult to implement than envisaged. The government has recently re-vamped the Action Plan and remains fully committed to the strategic goals of strengthening the Bureau of Internal Revenue and improving taxpayer compliance. Likewise, the comprehensive reform of the power sector has been held up by delays in passing the Omnibus Electricity Bill, but the government is confident that reforms will soon move forward with the expected passage of the Bill in the near future.

We have made substantial progress in implementing the program, and remain fully committed to its objectives and policies. The Philippine economy has made notable gains under the program. Although economic activity slowed in 1998, GNP growth remained positive notwithstanding the turmoil in regional and global financial markets as well as a major weather-related decline in agriculture. The peso has stabilized and strengthened in recent months; inflation has been success&thy contained; and growth is expected to recover in 1999. These gains testify to the resilience of the Philippine economy to the severe shocks experienced over the last two years and reflect the implementation of sound economic policies before and after the outbreak of the crisis. Looking ahead, even though the regional outlook has improved notably, the external environment remains uncertain and difficult. As foreseen under the program, economic policies at this juncture are focused on nurturing a recovery without undermining the stabilization gains, through a cautious easing of macroeconomic policies accompanied by vigorous pursuit of key structural reforms. The attached Supplementary Memorandum summarizes our economic and financial program for 1999, including performance criteria for end-September and end-December 1999. On this basis, we request completion of the fourth review under the stand-by arrangement. Sincerely yours, Id Gabriel C. Singson Governor Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas IS/ Edgardo B. Espiritu Secretary of Finance Department of Finance Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 106- ATTACHMENT Manila, Philippines June 30. 1999 Supplementary Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies I. INTRODUCTION 1. The Government of the Philippines’ economic program remains on track. The economy has stabilized further in recent months, with inflation coming down as programmed, the peso strengthening, and renewed access to private foreign capital markets on appropriate terms. Strong policy implementation under the program has contributed to the stabilization gains and laid the foundations for a recovery of confidence and growth. 2. The focus of economic policy remains to support the recovery without undermining stabilization, and to protect the poor from the worst effects of the crisis. Consistent with these goals, the program continues to aim at: (i) a well-measured fiscal expansion to stimulate domestic demand and fund anti-poverty programs, supported by external financing and within a clear framework for medium-term fiscal sustainability; (ii) a gradual easing of the monetary policy stance, subject to continued disinflation and stability in the peso; and (iii) the vigorous pursuit of key structural reforms to support sustained rapid growth and stabilization. 3. The revised macroeconomic framework of the program is summarized below: Macroeconomic Framework for 1999 1998 1999 (In percent) Real GNP growth 0.1 l’/r3% Real GDP growth -0.5 1-3 Inflation (end-period) 10.4 1.5 Inflation (average) 9.7 8.5 (In billions of US$) External current account balance 1.3 1.7 Gross official reserves (adjusted) 9.6 13.4 (In percent of GNP) Underlying consolidated public sector deficit 2.9 3.2 Il. FISCALPOLICY 4. The overall fiscal target for 1999 (an underlying consolidated public sector deficit (CPSD) of 3.2 percent of GNP) remains appropriate. Consistent with this target, performance Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 107- criteria have been established for the public sector financing requirement (PSFR) during the second half of the year (Annex IA). 5. As envisaged under the program, the budget deficit in 1999 is being financed mainly from foreign sources. This greatly facilitates the task of monetary policy to contain inflation without unduly constraining growth in credit to the private sector. The composition of foreign budget financing during 1999 is summarized in Annex II. 6. The national government (NG) budget for 1999 remains an appropriate framework for new budgetary commitments in 1999, reflecting the government’s spending priorities. The overall cash deficit of NG operations is targeted at P 68.4 billion (authorities’ definition), or 2.2 percent GNP, consistent with the CPSD target noted in 74. Within this overall target, revenues in early 1999 have been lower than programmed because of a one-time refund of income tax payments made in 1998, a weaker tax base as growth was concentrated in lower- taxed activities, and continued unsettled issues with tax administration. As a result, the end- March performance criterion on the public sector financing requirement (PSFR) was exceeded by P 6.1 billion. For the year as a whole, we expect to keep within the original fiscal program targets. We now project NG revenues to be about 1 percent of GNP lower than programmed, which will be roughly offset by lower outlays on interest and on accounts payable from previous years to be settled in 1999 (see 111 below). Should cash settlements of accounts payable exceed the currently projected amount (P 50 billion), we would accommodate this through an increase in the fiscal deficit of up to P 10 billion (0.3 percent of GNP). The PSFR limits for end-June, end-September, end-December will be adjusted for deviations in the settlement of accounts payable from the projected path, as shown in Annex IA. However, the option of a higher deficit would only be chosen if no other unanticipated gains on the revenue side or interest savings are identified, as limiting the fiscal deficit to the programmed level remains a key element of our stabilization and growth strategy. Should revenues fall further, we would contain expenditures to this end. On this basis, we request a waiver of the non- observance of the end-March 1999 performance criterion on the PSFR. To accommodate the revised phasing up of NG operations during the year, we also request a modification of the PSFR performance criterion for end-June, as presented in Annex I.A. 7. Strengthening revenues continues to be an important goal of our program. The government remains fully committed to the objective of improving tax administration, especially at the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). The principal strategic elements of BIR reform remain (i) to improve the BIR’s information and management systems; (ii) to streamline the system of bank remittances; (iii) better collections from large taxpayers; (iv) more effective audit programs, especially for VAT and excise taxes; and (v) to step up collection enforcement and reduce graft and corruption. 8. We have made considerable progress in implementing this agenda. In particular, the BIR’s tax management information and control capabilities have been upgraded; the system of bank remittances for large taxpayers has been changed; and tax return and payment forms have been simplified. We have also taken steps to improve control over tax credits and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 108 - refunds, and to strengthen the focus on large taxpayers (including through establishment of a large taxpayers division at BIR headquarters). By the same token, BIR acknowledges that Iiuther work is needed to enhance audit and enforcement functions in a systematic fashion. 9. Therefore, we have decided to re-evaluate the BIR’s current reform strategy, in close collaboration with the IMF, at a workshop scheduled for end-June. We anticipate that, on the basis of this re-evaluation, we shall reconfirm the key strategic objectives as well as specific reform measures needed at the BIR, prior to the completion of the current program review. In the meantime, we intend to proceed with agreed reform measures as outlined in the attached matrix (Annex III), which also summarizes progress made so far. In particular, the BIR by end-July will formulate selective audit programs for VAT and excise taxpayers, and implement the pending excise tax revenue regulations. We are also currently in the process of strengthening the activities of the Bureau of Customs toward the control of exemptions, and the monitoring of the end-use of exempt goods on a selective basis. 10. As part of the ongoing efforts to strengthen the financial sector, taxation of the sector is being comprehensively reformed. These reforms, on which draft legislation is being submitted to Congress, are designed as a broadly revenue-neutral package and include: (i) phased introduction of tax deductibility of specific loan-loss provisions; (ii) rationalization of the documentary stamp tax @ST), including elimination of DST on secondary issues; (iii) elimination of the gross receipts tax (GRT) applicable to financial institutions; (iv) introduction of a noncreditable tax on profits and wages for banks, lending investors, and the non-leasing business of finance companies; (v) an increase in the withholding tax rate on interest income from residents’ foreign currency deposits (to 10 percent); and (vi) harmonization.of taxation of income from foreign-currency lending to residents with that of domestic-currency lending, at the regular corporate income tax rate (33 percent). 11. A number of measures are being implemented to improve expenditure control, taking into account the recommendations of an IMF technical assistance mission. A database on accounts payable arising from previous years’ expenditure appropriations, as well as the portion of these payables that can be identified as arrears awaiting liquidation by cash payment, has been set up and will be updated on a monthly basis. The stock of accounts payable as of December 3 1, 1998 was P 137 billion, of which only a small portion (P 10 billion) are estimated to have been in arrears at end-March 1999. Of those P 137 billion, some P 79 billion arose from commitments made in 1996 or prior years. We will advise agencies that these commitments (other than for foreign-assisted projects), for which no bills have been presented for payment, will no longer be covered, and that agencies will have to apply for a renewal of appropriations for related claims for payment, with full details of the suppliers, amounts due and justification of the claim. We expect this to significantly lower the stock of accounts payable. We are committed to gradually eliminating, by the end of 1999, remaining arrears on accounts payable as of end-1998, together with settling other accounts payable that become due and demandable. The revised NG cash budget plan for 1999 projects use of about P 50 billion for this purpose (P 10 billion less than originally estimated). In addition, we intend to introduce during 1999 a modified accounting system which will allow Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 109- the identification of payment arrears in the existing accountability reports. To prevent a renewed accumulation of payment arrears, the government will strive to implement mture expenditure restraint at the appropriation or commitment level to keep the fiscal program on track, and to identify specific expenditure items for inclusion in any emergency cutback package. This should allow any such cuts to be well-targeted (to low priority items) and help avoid the need for across-the-board sequestration. 12. The temporary increase in the fiscal deficit during 1998-99 underscores the need for consolidation in subsequent years to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability. The government’s medium-term fiscal framework envisages a steady improvement in the NG balance starting in 2000, toward a small surplus over the medium term. Much of the improvement is to derive from an enhanced revenue effort, including the revenue measures agreed during the last program review and improved tax administration. In particular, we are submitting draft legislation to rationalize tax incentives, and we shall avoid the granting of unduly wide import duty exemptions in implementing the 1997 Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (by defining a positive list of duty free goods and beneficiaries engaged in those two sectors). Higher revenues are needed to reduce the deficit while providing adequate resources for expenditure priorities, especially on critical infrastructure and anti-poverty programs in the rural areas, Expenditures would remain at about I9 percent of GNP, but with a shift in the composition of spending toward the priorities noted above. These medium-term targets are supported by the program of public-sector reforms outlined in 129 below. 13. In line with these medium-term objectives, our preliminary target for the year 2000 is to reduce the NG deficit to around 1.2 percent of GNP, with a reduction in the underlying consolidated public sector deficit to about 2.2 percent of GNP. These targets will be supported by the revenue measures currently pending in Congress; our continued efforts to improve tax administration; and the anticipated beneficial impact of economic recovery on tax collections. On the expenditure side, the regularization of accounts payable in 1999 and the one-time nature of the fiscal stimulus package will also result in some cash savings next year. Comprehensive reform of the NPC (730) will contribute to containing the deficit of GOCCs. 14. The aggregate deficit of the government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) is now targeted at P 33.7 billion in 1999, compared with P 19.2 billion projected at the time of the last review. The increase is mainly due to a delay in tariff adjustments of the National Power Corporation (NPC), reclassification of some NPC capital expenditures, and investment and lending operations by the National Development Corporation (NDC) providing funds to the agricultural sector. The involvement of NDC is a temporary arrangement to ease the shortage of t%nds and provide an initial boost to growth in the agricultural sector, and will not exceed f 5 billion. The NPC base tariff increase (7.9 centavos/kwh) has now been approved and will become effective July 1, 1999. NPC will make additional efforts to improve its finances, including through streamlining its capital spending program. The National Food Authority is expected to limit its deficit to P 4.8 billion in 1999, compared with Q 11.9 billion in 1998 (reflecting the absence of emergency rice imports).

III. MONETARY AND EXCHANGE BATE POLICY 15. The primary goals of monetary policy remain to reduce inflation while maintaining broad stability of the peso. Favorable recent developments in prices and exchange rates are permitting a continued gradual easing of the monetary stance in support of recovery. In the period ahead, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) will continuously evaluate the inflation outlook and the external position and adjust the monetary stance accordingly. 16. Consistent with the program’s macroeconomic framework, the monetary program for 1999 is based on projected broad money growth of 15.0 percent (12-month basis) and base money growth of IO. I percent (adjusted for the 3 percentage point reduction in liquidity reserves). Quarterly ceilings on base money during the second half of the year have been established as performance criteria under the program (Annex 1.B). 17. A continued sound financial position of the BSP is critical to the effective implementation of its monetary policy and supervisory functions. Draft legislation to restore the BSP’s tax exempt status has been submitted to Congress. Restoration of the BSP’s tax exemption will be accompanied by an increase in the proportion of BSP net income transferred to the government (after adequate provision for reserves and capital). The government remains committed to the program of BSP recapitalization set out in 1993. 18. The peso will continue to float, with intervention in the foreign exchange market to meet the performance criteria for net international reserves (NIR) and as necessary for short- term smoothing operations. Quarterly floors for NIR during the second half of 1999 have been established as performance criteria under the program (Annex 1.C). Nondeliverable forward contracts (NDFs) of the BSP will be liquidated as programmed. We remain committed to maintaining open current and capital accounts for external transactions. IV. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND DEBT MANAGEMENT 19. The BSP is taking the opportunity provided by the ongoing rapid external adjustment to tinther build up reserves and reduce the Philippines’ vulnerability against shocks. The external current account is projected to register a surplus of %I .7 billion in 1999 and net capital inflows will remain positive as the government has regained access to international capital markets on reasonable terms. Accordingly, we now envisage an overall balance of payments surplus of $3.2 billion, which will allow gross reserves to rise comfortably above the level of short-term external debt. 20. In addition to successfully issuing bonds in private foreign capital markets, the government is receiving support from official sources, including the World Bank, the Asian . Development Bank, and Japan. We welcome such support, which is essential for attaining our Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- lll- balance of payments targets, improving the maturity structure of our external debt, and helping to finance the budget. Consistent with these plans, quarterly limits on short-, medium-, and long-term external debt during the second half of 1999 have been established as performance criteria under the program (Annexes ID and 1.E). 21. We shall continue to work on improving our economic statistics and practices regarding data reporting and publication. Progress is being made by the Inter-Departmental Committee on “Improvement of External Debt and Balance of Payments Statistics,” taking into account the recommendations of recent follow-up technical assistance from the IMP. The BSP continues work toward improving the accuracy, reliability, and coverage of banking data. It is also developing, with IMP technical assistance, an economic database project that will warehouse BOP and other financial data and allow forecasting of key financial variables. The BSP intends to develop survey-based data collection to complement the present system based on banking data. The BSP is also embarking on an effort to improve its short-term debt monitoring capabilities, with technical assistance from the IMP. The Philippines is already complying with most of the key areas of the IMP’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and will continue to work toward full compliance. V. STRIJCIWRA L REFORMS 22. The government’s structural reform agenda remains at the core of its medium-term growth and development strategy With stabilization well advanced, our efforts toward an early, strong, and sustained recovery are focusing on implementation of critical steps in key reform areas. Banking sector 23. The Philippine banking system has proven more resilient than in some other countries in the region that have been affected by the crisis, Nevertheless, the system remains under stress reflecting the slow pace of economic recovery, although the recent stability of the peso and declining interest rates have eased pressure on borrowers’ ability to repay loans. The government’s market-based strategy to strengthen the financial system, developed in consultation with the World Bank and the lMF, continues to be appropriate. We have tightened prudential standards related to loan classification and provisioning, bringing the Philippines broadly in line with international norms. At the same time, the BSP has taken steps to monitor more closely individual problem banks, ensuring that corrective action is taken to redress any slippages from regulatory standards. More generally, banking supervision is being further strengthened through adoption of consolidated supervision, which will be tidly implemented once legislation currently before Congress is enacted, and by implementing a risk management approach to supervision. 24. Measures to raise minimum capital requirements, encourage the faster recognition of impairment of assets, and require higher general and specific loan-loss provisioning are having their envisaged effect: weaker banks are raising additional capital, trying to merge with other Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 112- stronger banks, or seeking downgrades in their licenses which would limit the types of operations that can be conducted. While most medium- and large-size banks are Molly in compliance with the new minimum capital requirements, for the few that fall short of requirements, some have identified merger partners and/or other corrective actions as required by the BSP. More generally, bank mergers are being encouraged through specific temporary incentive measures (such as allowing phased compliance with provisioning requirements as well as counting the revaluation of fixed assets of merged institutions toward capital). Finally, we have initiated a diagnostic review of the Philippine payments system, supported by JMF technical assistance, with a view to modernizing it while redressing any possible sources of systemic risk. 25. For the system as a whole, capital adequacy ratios now average 18 percent, well above the 10 percent required by law. Although this reflects in part the banks’ general reluctance to lend in the current environment, we are concerned that the tighter capital and provisioning framework may unduly constrain a recovery of bank lending to creditworthy customers. Accordingly, we are allowing an exemption from the general provision requirement for any increase in the stock of outstanding credits over the end-March 1999 level. We will review the appropriateness of the general provisioning requirements in the context of improvements in bank supervision and as the economic recovery is firmly established. At the same time, we are cognizant of the increase in market risks facing the banks. For this reason, we are tightening the criteria for excluding restructured loans from nonperforming loans. We are also introducing new reporting requirements on foreign exchange maturity mismatches. 26. We remain tidly committed to the privatization of the government’s equity stake in the Philippine National Bank (PNB) to a strategic partner by mid-2000, at the latest. To this end, a comprehensive external audit of the PNB (including an assessment of the bank’s financial condition as well as its organization and management systems) has been initiated, in close collaboration with the World Bank and the government’s financial advisors on PNB privatization. We anticipate that the financial audit and diagnostic overview will be completed by July 30, 1999. The resulting diagnostic study, which will be tinalized by August 30, 1999, will provide a sound basis for designing the precise path toward successful privatization of the bank In the meantime PNB will not undertake any actions that might compromise the objective of privatization within the agreed time frame, and any regulatory action taken by the BSP will be designed with a view to facilitating that objective while preserving the safety and soundness of the bank Completion of the external audit and adoption of an appropriate action plan toward privatization will be an important topic for the next (fifth) program review. Corporate sector 27. The government is implementing the agenda for corporate sector reforms outlined in our Memorandum of January 20, 1999. The reforms are being supported by the World Bank, through technical assistance and a planned Financial and Corporate Sector Reform (FINCORP) Loan expected to be approved before end-l 999. Specifically, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has drafted a new set of operating rules for corporate debt Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 113 - resolution consistent with the principles under the program. We expect the new rules to be adopted by the Commission for public hearings by end-June 1999, and to be implemented by end-July 1999. Reforms under the FINCORP loan will include measures to strengthen financial discipline in the corporate sector and to strengthen the legal framework for protection of creditors’ rights subject to Philippine laws and jurisprudence. 28. We intend to review the performance of SEC under the new operating rules by March 2000, and will then propose tbrther reforms on the basis of that review. We envisage that over the medium term the quasi-judicial function of the SEC will be transferred to the court system, under a new bankruptcy law, but in the near term the SEC remains the only practicable vehicle for debt resolution. Public sector reforms 29. As noted in 112, public sector reforms remain crucial for achieving fiscal consolidation over the medium term. The government is collaborating closely with the World Bank in developing and implementing the reform agenda, under the requested Public Sector Reform Loan @‘XL--expected to be in place by end-1999-and the FMCORP loan mentioned in 127. 30. Key reform areas that will be addressed under the PSRL include: (i) advancing the reengineering of the core government bureaucracy; (ii) installing the NG medium-term budget framework and improving expenditure management; (iii) reviewing (with assistance from AsDB) the system of allocating resources and delineating responsibilities between the NG and local government units; (iv) rationaliting the system of tax incentives; (v) continuing the reform of tax administration along the program initiated in early 1998; and (vi) reducing corruption in the public sector. Reforms under the FINCORP loan will include measures to strengthen the social security and pension systems, comprehensive reform of the systems for contractual savings and housing finance, and corporate sector reforms (127). Electric power sector 31. The government remains fidly committed to the planned reform of the power sector, developed in collaboration with the AsDB under the Power Sector Reform Loan approved in December 1998. The Omnibus Electricity bill has been re-submitted to Congress and is expected to be approved in 1999. The bill will enable the necessary reforms and eventual privatization of the NPC. Progress with these reforms will be an important topic in the next review. In the interim, as noted in 114, stop-gap measures are being implemented to arrest the deterioration in the finances of the NPC. Trade and investment liberalization 32. Trade and investment liberalization is proceeding well. The average tariff rate will decline to 10.1 percent in 1999 and 8.2 percent in 2000, and the maximum tariff rate (which Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 114- applies to some agricultural goods) will be reduced to 65 percent in 1999 (from 80 percent). The temporary tariff increases announced in January 1999 will lapse as planned on December 3 1, 1999, and no fbrther similar measures will be adopted during the program period. A transparent rule-based system of quota allocations under the Minimum Access Volumes (MAV) has been established, consistent with WTO regulations. Dr& laws are before Congress to liheralize investment in the retail trade sector and to allow 100 percent foreign ownership in distressed banks (gradually to be reduced to 70 percent over a period of ten years). National Food Authority (NFA) and grains sector 33. The planned reforms of the NFA will proceed in 1999, with assistance from the AsDB under a “Grain Loan” slated for approval by late 1999. A key intention is to separate the regulatory functions of the NFA from its market intervention functions, accompanied by further hberalization of the rice and corn markets. In addition, we intend to implement a targeted food safety net program for the poor, and to widen the scope for private sector participation in rice imports. Over the medium term, measures to strengthen grain production and distribution will include replacement of the quantitative restriction on rice imports with an out-quota tariff rate and gradual reduction of the tariff protection for corn, subject to the passage of appropriate legislation. *** The government is confident that the policies outlined in this memorandum will enable it to achieve the objectives of its economic program. The next (fifth) review of the program is scheduled to be completed in September. That review will focus, in particular, on implementation of the financial program and progress with key structural reforms in the banking sector, tax administration, and the public and corporate sectors.
