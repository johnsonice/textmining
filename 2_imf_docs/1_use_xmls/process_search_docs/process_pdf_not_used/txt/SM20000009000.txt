CONTAINS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND JNDIA Staff Report for the 2000 Article IV Consultation Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2000 Consultation with India Approved by Mario I. Blejer and Thomas Leddy May l&2000 Executive Summary . At the conclusion of the 1998 Article IV consultation with India, Directors stressed the need for strengthened macroeconomic and structural policies. Notably, in view of the large fiscal deficit and its adverse effect on long-term growth, they called for an ambitious and front-loaded fiscal adjustment program, including measures to widen the tax base and improve the quality of public expenditure. Directors cautioned against a premature easing of monetary policy and excessive monetization of the deficit, and encouraged the monetary authorities to resist an undue depreciation of the exchange rate. Directors also noted that structural reforms across a broad front were needed to reinvigorate growth. . Subsequent Article IV consultation discussions were delayed by elections and the February 2000 budget. Initial discussions were held in November 1999 by a staff team comprising: M. Blejer (Head), C. Towe, D. Kanda (EP), and P. Reynolds (all APD); J. Herderschee (PDR); G. Kopits (FAD), and G. Lind and T. Olafsson (MAE). Discussions were concluded during March S-16,2000 by M. Blejer (Head), C. Towe, D. Kanda (EP), and P. Reynolds (all APD). C. Sassanpour, the Senior Resident Representative, assisted both missions. . National elections held in September/October 1999 resulted in a comfortable majority for the ruling coalition. Although relations with Pakistan remain strained, the military conflict along the border, which intensified in May 1999, had eased by late summer. . The economy has performed well. Industrial production recovered strongly in 1999 and into 2000, and service sector activity has been robust. Despite a moderation of agricultural growth following the bumper harvest in 1998/99, real GDP growth is estimated to have been 6 percent in 1999/00. Inflation, which fell below 2 percent in mid- 1999, has begun to rebound but remains low at around 4% percent. The external situation has remained comfortable despite higher world oil prices, owing to a pickup in exports and portfolio inflows. . However, longer-term prospects are a concern. Important policy challenges need to be faced in order to sustain and improve upon this recent growth performance and achieve meaningful progress toward poverty reduction. The immediate priority is fiscal consolidation. The deficit of the consolidated public sector, which is estimated to have reached 11 percent of GDP in 1999100, has put upward pressure on real interest rates and dampened private investment. At the same time, the growing debt-service burden has undermined the public sector’s ability to fund needed infrastructure investment and social programs. Bold structural reform also is needed to promote growth and efficiency, and to improve India’s ability to compete effectively in the global economy. . India subscribes to the SDDS.

INTRODUCTION 1. During the past decade, India has been among the fastest growing economies in the world. Following a balance of payments crisis in 199 1, the economy recovered rapidly- partly reflecting a favorable supply response to structural reforms-and growth reached in excess of 7 percent in the mid- 1990s. The economy was also able to weather the Asian crisis well, owing to a strong external position, flexible exchange rate management, and long- standing capital account restrictions.’ Although economic activity slowed in 1997/98, growth has since recovered, inflation has eased, and the external position remains comfortable. .._ 2. Nonetheless, poverty in India remains a pressing concern. Despite rapid growth in recent decades, the poverty rate remains high, with more than a third of the population estimated to be living below the official poverty line, and regional income disparities appear to have increased. While India’s per capita income and social indicators-including mortality rates, literacy rates, and life expectancy-have improved, they continue to lag behind many of its regional neighbors (Chart 1 and Table l).2 Recent World Bank reports note that the unreliability of the statistics make drawing firm conclusions regarding poverty trends difficult, but conclude that there is an obvious need to improve the quality and effectiveness of social programs. 3. Bold action on the fiscal and structural policy fronts is required to achieve and sustain the 7-8 percent growth rates that will be needed to make more substantial progress toward poverty reduction. The critical challenge is to address the fiscal situation, which has deteriorated markedly in recent years, crowding out private investment and limiting the scope to fund needed infrastructure and social programs. There is also a pressing need for structural reform-although considerable progress has been made during the past decade, the private sector continues to be shackled by pervasive regulatory and structural rigidities. The absence of progress in these areas will not only jeopardize longer-term growth prospects, but will also leave the economy increasingly vulnerable to adverse shocks. ’ See “India and the Asia Crisis,” in India-Selected Issues, forthcoming, for a discussion of the factors that helped insulate India from the turmoil affecting the rest of the region. 2 The literacy rate increased from 52 percent to 64 percent between 1991 and 1997, and the infant mortality rate fell from around 80 percent to around 70 percent during the same period.

Following a succession of weak coalition governments since 1996, the September/ October 1999 elections returned the BJP-led government of Prime Minister Vajpayee with a solid majority in Parliament. While diplomatic relations with Pakistan remain strained, the military conflict along the disputed border in the Kargil area of Jammu and Kashmir, which flared in May 1999, had eased by late summer. The international sanctions that were imposed following India’s nuclear tests in May 1998-which involved a curtailment of nonhumanitarian aid by bilateral donors and international financial institutions (IFIs)---have been relaxed. 5. Recent macroeconomic developments also have been favorable (Chart 2 and Table 2). GDP growth increased to 6% percent in 1998/99 (the fiscal year begins on April l), from 4% percent in 1997/98, as a sharp pickup in agricultural production and continued fiscal expansion more than offset the adverse effect of the Asian crisis on exports and industrial activity. Although growth is estimated to have moderated to 6 percent in 1999/2000, this reflects a slowing of agricultural production following the previous year’s bumper harvest.3 The industrial sector recovered strongly, growing by 8 percent, and service sector activity has been robust.4 Growth in these sectors was buoyed by a revival of exports and a pickup in domestic demand resulting from improved agricultural incomes and a sharp increase in public sector spending on salaries. 6. After easing in 1999, price pressures have begun to pick up (Chart 2). Wholesale price (WPI) inflation rose sharply during the second half of 1998, reaching a peak of 8% percent in July on a 12-month basis (compared with an average of around 5 percent in the previous two years), due to supply problems in a number of key agricultural commodities.5 As supply conditions improved, agricultural prices fell sharply and inflation declined to 2 percent by midyear. However, with the dissipation of the base effect, the 40 percent diesel 3 The devastating cyclone that struck Orissa in October 1999 also severely affected agricultural production in that state. 4 Service sector activity has been an important engine of growth during the 199Os, increasing as a share of GDP from around 40 percent in 1990/91 to 47 percent in 1999/00, largely driven by the communications sector. Penetration of computer technology has been rapid and analysts project PC sales growth of 40 percent in 2000. Production of computer software and other related services, and their export overseas, also has been significant, reflecting India’s strong comparative advantage as a low-cost provider of information technology. 5 CPI inflation reached 20 percent (12-month basis) in late 1998, owing to the larger weight on food, but fell to zero in November 1999. The emphasis is on WPI inflation in India, as the WPI is more timely and comprehensive than the CPI.

The external situation remains comfortable. The current account deficit narrowed to 1 percent of GDP in 1998/99, from 1% percent of GDP in 1997/98. Although the Asian crisis caused a sharp drop in merchandise exports, this was more than offset by the decline in imports, which fell in response to the slowdown in industrial activity, as well as to the fall in world oil and gold prices (Chart 3 and Table 3). Despite the subsequent rise in oil prices, the current account deficit is estimated to have increased only to around 1% percent of GDP in 1999/00. Merchandise exports have recovered strongly-growing by 10 percent in 1999/00 (customs basis)-and non-oil imports have remained remarkably subdued. 8. Private capital inflows have recovered from the effects of the regional crisis and reserves have increased. Following the onset of the Asian crisis, net portfolio investment and commercial borrowing turned negative, and foreign direct investment inflows slowed. Investor confidence and private capital inflows were further affected by the sanctions and domestic political uncertainty. However, Resurgent India Bonds (RIBS) sold to nonresident Indians in August 1998 yielded $4.2 billion, and portfolio inflows recovered during 1999 as investor sentiment toward India improved. Gross foreign exchange reserves have risen steadily to $38 billion (6% months of imports of goods and services) at end-March 2000, while other indicators of 30 80 external vulnerability also EiXCHANGE RATES remain favorable (Table 4).6 33 - REER 9. As the regional crisis abated and pressures on the rupee moderated, the focus of monetary policy shifted in early 1999 to supporting the industrial recovery.7Theexchangerate settled into a narrow trading range after August 1998, and the RI31 announced a bias - 68 45...l..‘..l..l..l..‘. ~..I..I..l..I I .I..l..l..I..l..l ,.., .‘.

The shift in policy emphasis was reflected mainly in several reductions in the banks’ cash reserve requirement during the year, and interest rate cuts were limited to a 1 percentage point reduction in the Bank Rate in February. Although longer-term bond yields declined significantly during the past year, short-term and bank lending rates have been slower to adjust and, with the drop in inflation, real interest rates increased sharply. Nonetheless, credit growth to the commercial sector has accelerated, reaching 16’% percent in March 2000 (12-month basis) from 14l% percent a year earlier, partly owing to a pickup of housing and other construction, which responded to tax incentives included in the 1999/00 budget. 10. In recent months, the government and the RBI have moved more aggressively to lower interest rates. In the February 29 budget speech, the government announced a 1 percentage point reduction in the rate on provident fund deposits, following a similar cut in rates on postal saving deposits. The RBI followed on April 1 by cutting the Bank Rate and repo rate by 1 percentage point to 7 percent and 5 percent, respectively, and by announcing a further reduction in the cash reserve ratio from 9 percent to 8 percent. However, the RBI’s April 27 policy statement appeared to signal a tilt toward a more neutral stance, as it stressed the need to guard against the emergence of inflation pressures, and warned that recent price increases warranted continuous vigilance and caution. 11. Signs of recovery and the global boom in XT stock prices buoyed financial markets in India from late 1998 into early 2000. Stock prices rose by over 100 percent and setting new highs in February, in large part owing to the pickup in portfolio inflows from abroad, particularly into the Indian IT and entertainment sectors. However, bond and stock prices have been volatile since late February 2000-reflecting spillovers from the weaker U.S. stock market and concern that budget measures would undermine profits and reduce the scope for interest rate cuts-and by end-April, stock prices were 22 percent off their earlier highs.* 12. The fiscal position has deteriorated significantly in recent years, erasing much of the consolidation achieved following the 1991 balance of payments crisis (Chart 5 and Table 6). The overall public sector deficit has increased steadily from 8% percent of GDP in 1995196 to an estimated 11 percent of GDP in 1999/00, reflecting roughly equivalent erosions in the fiscal positions of the central and state governments. Slippages from the central government’s 1999/00 budget were severe, with the deficit reaching 7 percent of GDP, compared with a budget target of 5% percent of GDP, owing to shortfalls in revenues from excise duties, military outlays related to the Kargil border dispute, the lingering effects * IT-related stocks represent roughly 30 percent of the total market capitalization, and price- earnings ratios are high, However, vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that IT firms in India are relatively well established and earn profits.

Delays in raising energy prices also eroded the surplus of the (off-budget) oil pool account. 14 100 13. AIthough the central 12 90 government’s 2000/01 budget contained important reforms to the tax system, it suggests that little or no deficit reduction will 10 80 8 6 70 be achieved in the coming year (Box 1). In particular, the budget further reduced the number of tariff bands, moved the excise tax system closer to a single-rate VAT, and o SO 199X34 1994195 1995196 1996l97 1997198 199W9 1999/00 2000/01 established a timetable for the gradual elimination of the exemption of export income from taxation. Tax measures would raise revenues by about l/4 percent of GDP, and cuts in food and fertilizer subsidies would yield a further % percent of GDP. However, these savings would be offset by increased transfers to the states, which were mandated by the Finance Commission in January 2000, and higher military outlays, which are budgeted to rise to 2% percent of GDP in 2000/01 from 2% percent of GDP two years previously. As a result, the central government’s deficit would remain close to 7 percent of GDP in 2000/O 1. III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 14. In an October 1999 address to Parliament, the new government set the commendable objective of establishing the conditions for growth of at least 7-8 percent and for meaningful progress toward poverty reduction. At the same time, it was acknowledged that achieving these objectives would require fiscal discipline, improvements in physical infrastructure, and more effective social programs. The government also stressed the need for reforms in the area of small-scale industries, telecommunications, and foreign direct investment. 15. During the discussions the mission stressed that, while there have been some encouraging steps toward implementing this agenda, policies do not yet appear sufficient to achieve the government’s growth and poverty objectives. A sharp reduction ’ The staffs definition of the deficit differs from the official definition in that it includes onlending of small-savings deposits to the states as an expenditure item, and excludes divestment receipts from revenues.

India: The FY 2000/01 Budget The 2000/01 budget (April-March) targeted the overall central government deficit at 7.1 percent of GDP, implying no consolidation from the expected outturn for 1999/2000.’ New measures were expected to raise revenues by 0.5 percent of GDP, and cuts in food and fertilizer subsidies totaled 0.2 percent of GDP. However, these gains were expected to be fully offset by a 0.2 percent of GDP increase in defense spending and a 0.6 percent of GDP increase in transfers to state governments. Revenue measures . A 16-percent Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT) replaced the 3-rate MODVAT, although exemptions and special rates still apply to many items. . The 10 percent customs surcharge imposed in the 1999/00 budget was retained. . The peak rate of customs duty was cut from 40 percent to 35 percent (38.5 percent including the surcharge), reducing the number of ad valorem rates from 5 to 4. . Tariffication of quantitative restrictions, begun in April 2000, were effected at the new peak rate of 35 percent (plus the IO percent surcharge). . Import duties were reduced on crude oil, some petroleum products, and selected items relevant to the information technology, telecommunications, entertainment and jewehy industries. . The tax exemption on export earnings is to be phased out over the next five years. . The Minimum Alternate Tax rate was reduced from IO.5 percent to 7.5 percent of book profits, although all companies were brought under the tax net. . While agricultural income remains untaxed in India, farmhouses in the vicinity of major cities (a source of tax evasion) were brought under the tax net. . The 10 percent income tax surcharge on corporates was retained, and the surcharge on higher-income personal taxpayers was increased from 10 percent to 15 percent. . The tax rate on dividends and income distributed by some mutual funds was increased from 10 percent to 20 percent. . Tax concessions and exemptions were given to Small Scale Industrial units (SSIs), new ventures in backward areas, the film industry, some defense personnel, senior citizens, and women, and for higher and vocational education, housing, shipping, urban infrastructure, and sports. . Measures were proposed to improve excise tax assessment and increase taxpayer registration. Expenditure measures . Defense spending was budgeted to rise by 0.2 percent of GDP, to 2.7 percent of GDP. . Food and fertilizer subsidies were budgeted to decline by 0.1 percent of GDP each, through better targeting of foodgrains and increases in fertilizer prices. The Finance Minister also stated that the fertilizer subsidy would be phased out over the medium- term. . The budget introduced a number of initiatives to promote rural housing, the provision of basic services, and credit flow to SSIs and the agricultural sector. . The budget did not contain specific measures in the critical area of civil service reform, although it was indicated that this issue would be studied by the newly constituted Expenditure Reforms Commission. Other policy initiatives . Divestment proceeds were targeted at 0.5 percent of GDP----the same as the 1999/00 budget target, but 0.4 percent of GDP higher than the estimated outturn for that year. The government committed itself to reducing its equity in non-strategic public enterprises to 26 percent or less, and to reducing its equity in public sector banks to 33 percent. Proceeds were earmarked for debt retirement, public enterprise restructuring and voluntary retirement schemes, social programs, and rural infrastructure. . The cap on foreign institutional investment was raised from 30 percent to 40 percent of a domestic company’s equity, and limits on Indian acquisition of foreign companies were eased. . The rate of interest on General Provident Fund deposits was reduced by 1 percentage point effective April 1,2000, following earlier and similar reductions in rates on Small Saving schemes and the Public Provident Fund. . With regard to banking reform, additional Debt Recovery Tribunals, a Financial Restructuring Authority, and a Credit Information Bureau are to be set up. . The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is to be accorded “greater operational flexibility” in its conduct of monetary policy. . In contrast to last year, the 2000/01 budget speech did not contain any medium-term fiscal consolidation targets. However, a committee has been set up to examine the possibility of a Fiscal Responsibility Act in India. Ii Staff definition of the deficit excludes divestment receipts from revenues, and includes on-lending of small saving collections to state governments in expenditures and net lending, in order to maintain comparability with historical data. The authorities’ definition of the deficit includes divestment receipts in non-tax revenues and, from 199912000, excludes on-lending of small saving collections from expenditures and net lending. On the authorities’ definition, and using the authorities’ projections for nominal GDP, the deficit is targeted to decline to 5.1 percent of GDP in 2000/01, against an estimated 5.6 percent of GDP in 1999/2000, owing to the anticioated increase in divestment receiDts Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- in the public sector deficit and debt is still needed to ensure fiscal sustainability, to crowd in private investment, and to facilitate increased funding for infrastructure investment and social services. ‘* Deeper structural reforms will also be required to allow India to facilitate efficiency gains in the private sector and to reap the benefits of globalization, particularly as the size of the public sector is reduced. A. Outlook and Risks 16. The mission and the authorities agreed that the short-term outlook for the Indian economy was generally favorable. The staff projections for 2000/O 1, which were prepared for the Spring 2000 WEO, are for growth to increase somewhat to 6% percent- roughly the same as the private sector consensus-mainly reflectin production growth and continued recovery in the industrial sector.’ f a rebound in agricultural Inflation is also projected to return to around 4?&-5 percent, as the impact of food and energy price increases feed through.t2 The current account deficit would remain at 1% percent of GDP as the assumed moderation of oil prices is offset by a recovery of import demand. Over the medium term, on the assumption of continued strength among partner countries, staff projections were cent, and the current account deficit to rise gradually but for growth to settle at around 6 per remain below 2 percent of GDP by the end of the five-year projection horizon (Table 7). 17. However, the mission cautioned that strong growth could not be sustained over the longer term without bold fiscal adjustment and more ambitious structural reform. In particular, confidence in the underlying strength of activity was undermined by the fact that recent growth had been largely consumption-led, and that 25 2s 20 20 I5 I5 IO IO s 5 0 0 199Ol91 1991/92 199203 1993l94 1994l95 1995196 1996i97 1991198 199W9 ‘* See “Growth Theory and Convergence across Indian State-A Panel Study” in India- Selected hues, forthcoming, for a discussion of the impact of infrastructure investment and social programs on interstate growth. ” Recent reports of severe drought in some states suggest that agricultural growth prospects are particularly at risk.

I3 The mission noted further that if the fiscal situation of the center and the states were not addressed, the debt dynamics would become increasingly precarious, particularly with the liberalization of financial markets and international capital flows. This implied an increasing risk that a shift in investor sentiment could tip the balance toward a fiscal crisis (Box 2). Although reserves were adequate and the projected current account deficits appeared sustainable, weak public savings also meant that the external balance remained particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, shocks to the terms of trade and partner country activity, or a turnaround in portfolio capital inflows. In addition, incomplete reforms in the agricultural and industrial sectors suggested the risk of a difficult adjustment to the ongoing easing of external trade barriers. 18. The Indian officials were more confident regarding the economic outlook, Their budget estimate for 2000/01 growth was 7 percent, which they expected would be supported by continued export strength, a cyclical rebound in investment, and ongoing restructuring and technological advances in the manufacturing and services sectors. They cautioned that the mission’s estimate that potential growth was only about 6 percent was biased downward by the slow growth of agricultural production in recent years, and that higher trend GDP growth would be supported by the increasing contribution of the fast-growing service sector to GDP.14 They acknowledged, however, that both growth and the external position would be at risk if the fiscal situation were not addressed. B. Fiscal Policy 19. The mission expressed disappointment that the central government’s 2000/01 budget had not sought significant deficit reduction. The authorities agreed that the consolidation effort had been modest, but a more substantial effort had been precluded by the need to avoid disrupting the recovery, pressures to increase military expenditures, and mandated increases in transfers to the states. They stressed that the budget target was considerably more credible than in the past, and they discounted concerns that the excise and customs revenue projections might be too ambitious, or that political pressures would lead to I3 National accounts data on investment are not available past 1998/99.

India: Fiscal Sustainability 1 India has run large fiscal deficits throughout much of its recent history. Over the last two decades, the deficit )f the consolidated public sector has averaged almost 9 percent of GDP. The deficit ratio increase sharply in the lattei calf of the 199Os, reaching an estimated 11 percent of GDP and almost fully reversing the consolidation achieved bllowing the 1991 balance of payments crisis. The public sector debt ratio has also started to rise again, and stood at around 80 percent of GDP by 1999/00 (Chart 5).

Since India’s nominal GDP growth rate has typically exceeded the average nominal interest rate on ;ovemment debt-owing to the impact of financial repression on domestic borrowing costs and access to concessional :xtemal borrowing-the government has been able to borrow in order to service the existing debt stock without :ausing the debt-to-GDP ratio to explode. 1 However, there is upward pressure on the marginal cost of public sector debt-particularly at the state government level-which could lead to an unsustainable rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio. As domestic financial narkets have been liberalized, domestic borrowing costs have increased, while concessional external financing has .epresented a smaller proportion of total borrowing. Illustrative simulations of a simple growth model of the Indian :conomy suggest that the continuation of current policies-i.e., a constant primary deficit as a share of GDP-would ultimately result in explosive debt dynamics, which could arise sooner if there are external or other shocks to interest ates. Moreover, these simulations illustrate that the benefit of fiscal consolidation-in terms of higher growth and .educed external vulnerability-could be considerable, particularly if accompanied by structural measures that helped roost productivity growth.3 30 I India: Simulated Real GDP Groti Paths I ,I...................,.J, OL,“.““““““...“I 1998199 2003104 2008/09 2013/14 2018119 I%%99 2003/04 2008/09 2013114 2018/19 ’ Easterly, W., C.

The mission also expressed concern about the fiscal situation of the states (Box 3). State govemments had been unable to prevent their aggregate deficit reaching an estimated 4% percent in 1999/00, despite efforts by the central government to promote fiscal reform through the provision of extraordinary conditional loans totaling Rs 30 billion. Against this background, there appeared a risk that the increased transfers from the central government required by the Finance Commission could simply fuel higher state spending in 2000/01, particularly since details on how and under what conditions transfers would be allocated would not be established by the Finance Commission until well into the year. 21. The authorities agreed that it was critical to re-establish fiscal discipline at the state level. However, they seemed confident that expenditure pressures related to retroactive payments of salary awards would ease in the coming year, and that the state-level reforms that had been initiated during 1999/00 would endure, reinforced in some states by World Bank multisectoral financial and technical support, including adjustment lending. Nonetheless, they acknowledged that it was not clear whether the final report of the Finance Commission would provide greater scope to the central government to allocate transfers conditional on fiscal performance, which they felt had been effective in promoting reform last year.16 22. The mission stressed that ambitious fiscal consolidation by both the center and the states was needed to ensure fiscal sustainability and support the authorities’ growth objectives. In this context, the mission noted that the 1999/00 budget had already set the objective of eliminating the central government’s “revenue deficit”-i.e., to balance revenues against noncapital expenditures-over four years. Although this commitment had not been restated in the 2000/01 budget, it still seemed an appropriate medium-term target since, if achieved at the central and state levels, it would bring the public sector deficit down to 4-5 percent of GDP. The authorities responded that the slippages from the 1999/00 budget I5 The budget was passed on May 4, containing a number of tax concessions that had not been included in the original draft, including income tax exemptions to 2010 for firms establishing in export processing zones. Although the overall budget projections appear broadly consistent with staff estimates, risks include: budgeted excise and customs receipts, which appear somewhat more optimistic than would be suggested by historical revenue elasticities; and pension payments, which have been difficult to estimate in the wake of recent pay revisions. I6 The details of the loans have not been published, so their effectiveness is difficult to gauge. However, the government’s recent Economic Survey noted that states had not fully lived up to their commitments, partly owing to election pressures.

India: State Fiscal Developments State government deficits rose sharply, reaching record highs in the last two years. In large part, this was due to pressures to match central government pay increases,’ with the increase in the wage bill in 1998/99 estimated at Rs 2 10 billion (1.1 percent of GDP), Combined with poor cost recovery in social and economic sectors’ and stagnant state revenue collections, many states fell into arrears, and were in danger of defaulting on salary and other payments by early 1999100. In response, eleven states signed 10 Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with p the central government during 1999/00, promising fiscal reforms-such as improved B targeting of subsidies, hikes in user charges, , power sector restructuring, privatization, and reforms to tax systems and the civil $6 service-in exchange for advances of L- budgeted transfers of tax and grant ,“I E payments. While subsequent transfer 0 6’ payments were on occasion withheld from 0. states judged as non-compliant, monitoring by ’ the central authorities was hampered by lack of I both staff and timely data. At the end of the 1999/00 fiscal year, about Rs 30 billion of ’ these advances were converted into three-year I I,- loans, and states had also been allowed to increase their market borrowing by about Rs 20 billion. Additional lending under the MOU process during 2000/01 is not anticipated. State-level reforms are also being supported by external donors. In particular, Uttar Pradesh has negotiated with the World Bank a single-tranche subnational adjustment loan and credit totaling $250 million, which was approved by the Bank’s Board in April. The proposed assistance supports fiscal and governance reforms, and sets the stage for multi-sector Bank assistance-including for restructuring of the power and water sectors-over the medium term. Kamataka and Orissa have also entered discussions for multi-sector assistance from the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank has provided Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh with similar fast-disbursing loans. However, the $543 million economic structuring project for Andhra Pradesh approved by the World Bank in 1998-which led to significant reforms initially-has been threatened more recently by slow implementation due to local elections and a deterioration in the fiscal position. 1 In FY 2000/01, state revenues are expected to increase. A landmark sales tax agreement among the states was implemented in January 2000, setting minimum rates of taxation for four main categories of goods and placing a moratorium on new tax incentives. As the competitive provision of tax concessions had driven rates to very low level: in many states, the agreement will likely require an increase in taxes. In addition, transfers from the central government to the states have been increased by 43 percent-r 0.6 percent of GDP-relative to the expected outturn for 1999/00, as per the interim recommendations of the Eleventh Finance Commission (EFC).3 However, the allocation of these transfers across states will not be known until the EFC issues its final report at end-June 2000. While the authorities have urged the EFC to incorporate more conditionality in their allocation formulae in order to reward reforming states, any such incentives may not be introduced in time to have an impact on 2000/01 budgets. States usually choose to follow the pay revision recommended for the central government by periodic Pay Commissions. The Fifth Pay Commission recommended a 20 percent increase in salaries, retroactive to 1996. A recent government reported estimated implicit and explicit subsidies provided by the states at almost 10 percent of ;DP. Finance Commissions are constitutionally-mandated bodies, set up every five years to make recommendations on the amount and statewise allocation of central government transfers of tax collections and nonplan grants. While these ,ecommendations are not binding, they have usually been accepted. Note that the amounts of other types of transfers- yants and loans to support state and centrally-sponsored plan spending-are at the discretion of the central government, although the allocations of support for state plans is made according to formula.

If the states’ deficit were also brought down by around 1 ‘/z percent of GDP to close to the historical average, this would yield an overall public sector deficit of around 7% percent of GDP, which they viewed as sustainable.

The authorities hoped that a Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) would provide the framework for medium-term fiscal consolidation. The aim was to bring a bill to Parliament in the coming months containing caps on market borrowing by the central government as a means of promoting fiscal discipline. The mission endorsed this approach, but suggested that the FRA should establish a longer-term deficit objective, since a limit on market borrowing could be circumvented, including by borrowing from provident funds. The deficit target could be defined on the basis of the authorities’ measure of the revenue balance, since this objective already enjoyed political prominence and it would help reduce pressure to achieve consolidation by constraining public investment. However, it would be essential for the FR4 to incorporate strict fiscal transparency requirements, including the preparation of medium-term budget projections and strict delineation between current and capital transactions.r7 The mission suggested that the specific timetable for deficit reduction should l7 Although extensive budget documentation is released, transparency is undermined by the lack of medium-term budget projections, the substantial discretion allowed to tax officials, and delays in publishing general government estimates.

The authorities noted that the 2000101 budget had taken important steps in the direction of tax reform. These included tariffying quantitative restrictions on imports, phasing out tax exemptions on export income, and reforms to the excise tax system. Initiatives were also underway to establish a nationwide VAT at the state level by early 200 1, which could ultimately be integrated with the center’s excise system.‘* The mission endorsed the emphasis on developing a VAT, but cautioned that the timetable was ambitious and care would need to be taken to avoid repeating the experience of 199Os, when earlier steps toward converting the excise tax to a VAT had eroded central government revenues owing to weak tax administration and wide-spread exemptions. More generally, the mission stressed the importance of rebuilding the tax/GDP ratio, which had declined steadily since the early 1990s. This would need to involve base-broadening rather than rate increases, including by improving the system’s coverage of the services, small-scale industrial, and agricultural sectors, as well as by improving the efficiency and governance of tax administration. 25. The authorities cautioned that there was limited room for expenditure cuts at the central government level. Half the center’s expenditures were devoted to military outlays, transfers to state governments, and interest payments, and it was necessary to protect or increase development spending, which had eroded in recent years. However, it was hoped that decisions to extend the zero-based budgeting system and to establish an Expenditure Reforms Commission would yield savings, The mission suggested several areas for expenditure rationalization: government employment, which had grown in recent, years despite the Fifth Pay Commission’s recommendation for a 30 percent reduction over a 10 year period; implicit and explicit subsidies by central and state governments, which were estimated in the range of 14 percent of GDP; and project spending, where better expenditure management was needed to improve the quality of implementation and social rates of return. 26. The mission expressed serious concern regarding the contingent liabilities of the central and state governments. Explicit guarantees totaled 9% percent of GDP at end- March 1998, and implicit liabilities associated with future government pensions, insurance programs, and rehabilitating public sector banks and enterprises were likely to be significant, The authorities acknowledged the problem and noted that an on-budget redemption fund had been established during 1999/2000 to cover central government guarantees. Although the fund’s capitalization was quite small-less than 0.1 percent of outstanding guarantees-it represented an important first step toward recognizing their potential costs. In addition, most ‘* The states-which have constitutional jurisdiction over sales taxes-agreed last November to adopt common minimum sales tax rates, to forgo new sales tax exemptions, and to adopt a VAT by April 200 1. The center has constitutional responsibility for taxation at the manufacturing stage, and in the 2000/01 budget adopted a single 16 percent CENVAT rate, although several exemptions and special excise rates remain.

The mission emphasized the need to implement existing commitments to bring petroleum pricing to full import parity.lg The new government had taken the commendable step of raising diesel prices by 40 percent in October 1999, followed by hikes of LPG and kerosene prices of 30 percent and more than 100 percent, respectively, in March 2000. However, significant subsidies remained and further increases were necessary to avoid the oil pool account falling into deficit in 2000/01. 28. The mission called for faster progress toward divestment of public sector enterprises, since these have contributed significantly to public sector deficits and industrial inefficiencies. The authorities acknowledged that divestment had been slow, but they remained committed to reducing ownership in all “non-core” public enterprises to 26 percent or less, and to restructuring or closing other units. A Department of Disinvestment had been established in late 1999 in order to reduce bureaucratic impediments, and the emphasis was now on strategic sales rather than piecemeal share offerings.” In response to the mission’s suggestion that divestment proceeds should be treated as below-the-line financing, the authorities noted that the 2000/01 budget had moved partially in this direction by earmarking 10 percent of proceeds for debt reduction. However, treating asset sales as fiscal revenues had the advantage of maintaining the political impetus for divestment. C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 29. During the discussions- which took place before the April 1 easing-the mission suggested that the 2000/01 budget and buoyant credit demand had reduced the scope for further interest rate cuts. The monetary authorities broadly agreed and noted that, despite its bias toward ease, the REU had been cautious in lowering rates in the face of the large government borrowing requirement. Moreover, while interest rates appeared high in real terms, this reflected unusually low inflation rates during the past year, and expected inflation was considerably higher. In this context, they considered it more important to address structural factors that had kept bank spreads wide and lending rates high. This, rather than an effort to accommodate large new issues of government debt, had motivated recent decisions to reduce the cash reserve requirement. At the same time, however, the monetary authorities disagreed with the mission’s call to gear policy toward locking in recent infIation l9 A 1997 reform had established procedures for automatic monthly adjustments to petroleum product prices with the objective of achieving import parity, but price adjustments have not always been implemented as scheduled. *’ Nonetheless, in April 2000, the Department of Telecom Services successfully delayed the planned sale of a telecom operator over concerns regarding employee security.

The mission suggested that a more explicit statement of the RBI’s inflation objective could help anchor policy and expectations. The RBI’s de-emphasis of monetary targets, and the adoption of a “multiple indicators” approach to policy making, seemed an appropriate response to instabilities associated with financial sector liberalization (Box 4). However, in view of the lack of a well-defined monetary anchor and the continued large fiscal deficit, there seemed a risk that confidence in the RBI’s commitment to inflation control would be eroded.2’ The monetary authorities responded that their policy statements already contained fairly explicit reference to the RBI’s near-term inflation objectives, as well as clear statements of the RBI’s commitment to price stability. However, a more formal inflation target would not be appropriate given the predominance of agricultural supply shocks, the fiscal situation, the lack of a reliable measure of core inflation, and the need for policy to respond to exchange rate developments.22 ’ 31. The monetary authorities noted that the RBI’s policy was to allow the rupee to adjust flexibly to market forces, but to intervene in the spot and forward markets in order to avoid large transactions triggering disorderly market conditions. The staff endorsed the thrust of the exchange rate policy and noted that the exchange rate appeared broadly consistent with medium-term l?mdamentals.23 At the same time, however, the mission cautioned that exchange rate flexibility would be important in the period ahead, particularly in view of ongoing trade liberalization, growing capital inflows, and fiscal developments. The rupee’s marked day-to-day stability against the U.S. dollar could make 2’ Broad money growth slowed in early 2000 to just above the RBI’s 15 s-1 6 percent range, partly reflecting shifts into mutual funds. The provisional figures for March 2000 showed a further sharp deceleration, which appears to reflect the fact that the reporting date this year did not correspond to the banks’ fiscal year end, and consequently the year-end “window- dressing” apparent in other years’ data was absent. Although broad money continues to be a useful leading indicator of inflation, the lags are considerable-see “Modeling and Forecasting Inflation in India” and “Transition to Indirect Instruments of Monetary Control in India” in India-Selected Issues, forthcoming. 22 A core inflation index is being developed by the RBI, but complications include the lack of coverage of the service sector and the difficulty that would be encountered in obtaining public acceptance of a price index that did not include agricultural commodities. 23 In particular, recent export growth does not point to an overvaluation, and the current account deficit appears well within estimates of “equilibrium” values based on demographic, fiscal, and other factors-for details, see “Assessing India’s External Position” in India- Selected Issues, forthcoming. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- Box 4. India: The Monetary Policy Framework in India Objectives: Monetary policy in India emphasizes the objectives of price stability and growth, with the balance between the two depending on the prevailing situation, but within the context of keeping inflation within reasonable bounds. No formal inflation objective has been set, although the government’s 1997/98 Economic Survey stated that “4 to 6 percent inflation could be regarded as an acceptable level for India at present,” while the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) April 1999 Monetary and Credit Policy Statement said that “an important priority will be to contain inflation to around 5 percent during 1999/00.” Over the past two years, developments in the foreign exchange market have also been important in determining the monetary policy stance. Operation: Both direct and indirect instruments are used in the conduct of monetary policy. Although the RBI has announced its intention to reduce the use of adjustments to the banks’ cash reserve requirement (the Cash Reserve Ratio, or CRR) over the medium term, it has been actively used in recent years. In addition, the RBI manages liquidity through outright purchases/sales of government securities, repurchase arrangements (of up to 14 days, but usually of 3-4 days, maturity), and it also makes available a number of refinance facilities to banks and primary dealers. These are priced off the Bank Rate, which was reactivated in April 1997 as a reference rate and a signal of the RBI’s monetary policy stance. The repurchase rate and the Bank rate provide a rough floor and ceiling for overnight call money rates, respectively. The April 2000 Monetary and Credit Policy Statement announced that the liquidity support for primary dealers would no longer be at fixed margins over the Bank Rate, but would be priced on the basis of auctions, effective in June 2000. Given the segmented and illiquid nature of the money and credit markets, the link between the overnight rate and yields of longer maturity is weak. The RI31 actively manages yields of Treasury bills and bonds by devolving onto its own books issues that cannot be sold at prevailing market prices. Framework: Since the mid-1980s, monetary policy has been conducted via an intermediate target for credit or broad money growth. However, in its April 1998 Monetary and Credit Policy Statement, the RBI announced its intention to move toward a “multiple indicators” approach to the conduct of monetary policy, citing increasing uncertainties about the relationship between money, income, and prices in the short-run. Rather than simply relying on M3, policy would be guided by a range of indicators, including short-term interest rates, the exchange rate, foreign exchange reserves, and the fiscal situation. As noted in the RBI’s April 2000 policy statement, moving toward a more explicit commitment to an inflation objective-including in the context of an inflation target-would require addressing a number of key issues. a Agreement that inflation should be the primary object of monetary policy. Despite recent moves to define an “appropriate” rate of inflation, a clear political consensus has not yet emerged in favor of focusing monetary policy solely on inflation, or on the appropriate rate of inflation. l Improved price statistics. The existing price indices are inadequate for the purposes of inflation targeting. Both the wholesale (WPI) and consumer (CPI) indices are heavily influenced by agricultural supply shocks and changes in the prices of government controlled items. No measure of core inflation is calculated. Further, focus is generally placed on the WPI, rather than the CPI, in assessing inflation developments because of perceived weaknesses with the latter index. However, the high weight on manufacturing prices (nearly 60 percent), versus services and other goods, means that the WPI does not provide a representative measure of the general price index. l Greater independence of the RBI. Steps have been taken to increase the independence of the RBI by restricting government overdrafts. However, the scope for the RBI to contain government access to central bank financing is constrained by the large funding requirements of the state and central governments. l An improved understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism. With the move toward greater reliance on indirect monetary instruments, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is changing, bringing into doubt not only the size of the impact of monetary policy changes on real activity and inflation, but also the length of the lags involved. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- these adjustments more difficult, since it undermined incentives for adequate risk management by market participants and could create conditions for a build-up of speculative pressure. Against this background, it would be important to take steps to deepen the foreign exchange market and to increase its liquidity. 32. RBI officials noted the importance of reducing the economy’s external vulnerability, including by ensuring sufficient foreign exchange reserve coverage. Although the authorities did not have a specific target for reserves, adequacy was judged against a range of benchmarks, including: imports; annual debt service payments; short-term external debt and portfolio inflows; and currency in circulation. The RI31 also had reduced its forward foreign currency liabilities and lengthened the minimum maturity of foreign currency nonresident Indian deposits to reduce external vulnerabilities. D. Banking and Financial Sector Issues 33. Considerable progress has been made in the area of banking sector reforms since the early 199Os, although the process is still incomplete. Capital adequacy has improved, interest rates have been deregulated, priority lending requirements have been eased, and new entrants have increased competition. Supervision and regulation also have been strengthened significantly. Nonetheless, the sector is still dominated by state-owned banks, which represent roughly 80 percent of bank assets and suffer from over staffing, low profitability, and weak balance sheets. Legal and administrative impediments to debt recovery and weak governance have left nonperforming loans (NPLs) at a high level- 16 percent of outstanding loans, or 8 percent net of provisions, as of March 1999 (Table 8). 34. The authorities stressed their commitment to lowering public ownership of the banking sector. The 2000/O 1 budget promised legislation to reduce the minimum government share of public sector banks to 33 percent and to increase the autonomy of bank boards, which were dominated by government appointees. The mission welcomed these initiatives, but noted that there had been modest progress in achieving the previous minimum of 5 1 percent. It would be important to avoid undue delay in reducing public ownership toward the new limit, since this would facilitate needed improvements in governance and efficiency in the banking sector. The mission cautioned, however, that these objectives as well as private sector interest in equity participation, could be undermined by the government’s statement that the public sector characteristic of banks and their employees would be protected. 35. The authorities also have announced plans to revive three weak banks. An estimated Rs 50 billion would be provided for recapitalization, technological upgrades, voluntary separation schemes, and the establishment of asset reconstruction companies to purchase and resolve NPLs. In the event that bank performance did not improve, a restructuring authority would be established to supersede their boards. The authorities indicated that closing the banks was not an option, given the large number of employees involved. The mission noted that this strategy seemed similar to previous unsuccessful Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - attempts to revive these banks, and that ruling out closure created moral hazard, could delay needed restructuring, and might increase the ultimate cost of resolving the institutions. 36. The mission also stressed the importance of improving mechanisms for debt recovery. The Indian officials responded that the system’s effectiveness had been improved by a March 2000 amendment to the Debt Recovery Tribunals Act that provided for the attachment of collateral, and the provisions in the 2000/01 budget for a substantial increase in the number of tribunals and their staff. A Credit Information Bureau also would be established to improve the ability of banks to obtain information on defaulters, and Settlement Advisory Committees were being promoted within banks to reduce administrative impediments to negotiated debt settlements. 37. A staff assessment suggested India’s compliance with the Base1 Core Principles (BCPs) is relatively good. Nonetheless, a number of challenges still need to be addressed to bring supervision and prudential systems fully up to international standards. For example, clearly-defined rules for remediation in the case of undercapitalized banks and a framework for dealing with nonviable banks does not yet exist. In addition, prudential norms fall short of international standards in some areas and, although new regulations have been issued requiring banks to implement risk management systems, effective implementation would require extensive training of both bank and supervisory staff. 38. Nonbank financial institutions also pose challenges. After several nonbank financial companies (NBFCs) experienced financial difficulties, a new regulatory framework was established in 1998, which included minimum capital requirements and stricter supervision. However, the mission noted that the large number of NBFCs-roughly 650 are registered to accept deposits-could strain the RBI’s supervisory capacity. This highlighted the importance of avoiding explicit or implicit govermnent guarantees of NBFCs, including by extending the deposit insurance system to cover their deposits, as suggested by the Capoor Committee. The mission also noted that development finance institutions (DFIs)-which in the past have provided long-term credit to the industrial sector-were responding to competitive pressures by moving into nontraditional activities such as consumer loans, credit card business, and possibly insurance. This increased the urgency of enhancing the supervision of these institutions, as had been recommended by a recent government report on universal banking, and of dealing with the balance sheet problems of the two major publicly- owned DFIs. 39. The mission welcomed recent legislation to open the insurance sector to private and (to a limited extent) foreign entry. However, the staff noted that proposals to allow bank participation could put additional strain on the supervisory system, particularly since supervision was not formally performed on a consolidated basis. Moreover, in view of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicc -2l- fact that the two government-owned insurers would begin to face private competition, it would be important to divest them of responsibility for administering social programs.24 40. The authorities agreed that high and inflexible administered interest rates on provident funds and postal saving deposits adversely affected banks’ ability to attract deposits and imposed a significant fiscal burden. They noted that the 1 percentage point reduction in these rates in early 2000 had been an important first step toward making the system more flexible. However, there was significant political resistance toward further adjustments, despite their 11 percent yield and significant tax advantage.*’ The authorities aimed to address this problem, as well as generally insufficient savings for old-age security, through a major overhaul of the system. Recent proposals included the introduction of a system of individual retirement accounts, administered through the post office system, possibly as soon as end-2000 (Box 5). Savings would be invested in mutual funds, and savers would be guaranteed a minimum annuity value at retirement. The mission cautioned that reforms should be focused on addressing the unfunded liabilities of the current system and avoid undertaking new liabilities. 41. Measures have also been introduced to address problems with the Unit Trust of India (UTI) that emerged in mid-1998. The UTI-a government-sponsored mutual fund that accounts for nearly 80 percent of the industry’s assets-faced redemption pressures following news that the US-64, its largest fund, had suffered significant valuation losses on its stock portfolio and would be unable to maintain a 20 percent dividend rate. In response, the US-64 was recapitalized, and its dividend yield and redemption price were lowered, with a commitment to shift ultimately to net-asset-value pricing. The mission welcomed these moves, but suggested continued improvements in the regulation and supervision of the mutual fund industry would be needed to ensure proper corporate governance and financial stability, which was especially important given the large size of the UTI.26 E. Trade Policies and Capital Account Liberalization 42. The authorities stressed their continued commitment to trade liberalization. Progress in the area of tariff reduction has slowed in recent years, partly reflecting fiscal 24 For example, the 2000/O 1 budget gave the Life Insurance Corporation responsibility for providing subsidized life insurance to the poor. 25 Indeed, the Employees Provident Fund decided in April to retain the 12 percent yield on its deposits, despite the government’s reduction of the return on its assets to 11 percent. 26 A key outstanding issue is the need to amend the UT1 Act to bring the UT1 fully under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

India: The Pension System in India-Summary of the Report by the Expert Committe’ Problems with the current system Limited coverage: Existing old-age security systems-including government employee pension plans and the Provident Funds-presently only cover about 11 percent of the work force. High contribution rates and low rates of return: Contribution rates, including the employer share, to the Employee Provident Funds (EPF) and the Employee Pension System (EPS) are as high as 25 percent. Funds are invested largely in government securities, and have yielded only about a 2% percent real rate per annum during the past ten years. Long-term sustainability: The government employee pension plan is a defined-benefit system funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. Pension outlays have been projected to rise from around !4 percent of GDP in 1995 to nearly 2 percent of GDP by 2015, not including pension outlays for state government employees and military personnel. The Employee Pension Scheme also operates on a defined-benefit basis, and its actuarial balance is also suspect. Tax distortions: Pension income is taxable, but lump sum payments from the EPF are nontaxable, which creates a bias against annuity payments upon retirement. Proposed Reforms Existing system: Early withdrawals from the defined-contribution EPF plan should be prohibited except in the case of disability or death. An actuarial audit of the defmed-benefit EPS plan would be undertaken, a uniform employer contribution rate established, and fund assets would be professionally managed. Returns on the Public Provident Fund--the voluntary defined-contribution system for the unorganized sector-should be set with reference to the return on underlying assets and investment restrictions should be liberalized. The government pension scheme would be !%lly funded within 10 years. IRAs: All individuals would be required to open accounts and contribute a minimum of Rs 500 annually. Accounts would be accessed through bank branches, post offices, etc. In order to encourage contributions, depositors would be able to borrow up to Rs 5,000 against balances in excess of Rs 10,000. This loan limit would be halved in the case of individuals that contribute less than Rs 500 per year. Investment: Six investment managers would be defmed, and each would be required to offer three investment schemes, with varying degrees of risk. Managers of “low risk” funds would be required to pay a rate of return no less than 2 percentage points below the average for fimd managers in this asset class. Depositors would be guaranteed to receive the sum of contributions, and managers would be required to purchase insurance to meet this obligation. The system would be overseen by a new regulator, the Indian Pensions Authority. Tax treatment and withdrawals: Contributions and the return on deposits would be free of income tax, but withdrawals would be taxable. At age 60, depositors would be required to use the first Rs 200,000 of deposits to purchase an annuity (yielding roughly Rs 1,500 per month). Depositors would have discretion over the balance.

Nonetheless, the authorities emphasized that important steps had been taken toward simplifying the tariff system and reducing the maximum rate,*’ and the schedule for eliminating quantitative restrictions (QRs) on imports had been accelerated-half the 1,429 remaining QRs were removed in April 2000, and the balance will be removed by April next year. The authorities expressed confidence that existing tariffs rates would be sufficient to avoid import surges, except possibly for some sensitive agricultural goods. They also remained committed to the longer-term objective set in the 1999/00 budget to reduce Indian tariffs to “Asian levels,” which the staff estimates would involve lowering average tariffs by about 15-20 percentage points. 43. The mission noted that India’s use of anti-dumping and countervailing duties had increased markedly in recent years. In this context, the mission asked whether there was a risk that pressures to resort to these measures could increase with the lifting of QRs and tariff rate reductions. The authorities stressed that India’s use of these devices had not been excessive, was subject to clear and objective rules, and reflected a justified response to aggressive efforts to penetrate the large Indian market. 44. The authorities expressed concern regarding proposals for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. They felt that the emphasis instead should be on ensuring effective implementation of existing commitments, especially by industrial countries. It had been particularly disappointing that industrial countries had not lived up to the spirit of the Uruguay Round Agreement, including commitments to give “special regard” to developing countries before initiating anti-dumping actions. However, they indicated that they would be willing to go along with a consensus to reopen multilateral negotiations, so long as issues such as the environment and labor standards-which were better dealt with in other fora- were taken off the table. 45. The authorities indicated their continued commitment to capital account liberalization. However, in their view the Asian crisis had underscored the importance of the structural and macroeconomic preconditions for success, and their strategy was to relax capital account restrictions only as the domestic financial sector, including supervisory and regulatory systems, were strengthened. Liberalization efforts, therefore, had focussed on longer-term capital inflows, especially foreign direct investment (FDI) and corporate transactions. Recent measures included moving to a negative list for FDI, easing restrictions on domestic companies floating ADWGDR issues, and relaxing restrictions on foreign *’ In recent years, the number of tariff bands have been reduced from seven to four, and the maximum tariff rate has been lowered from 40 to 35 percent (excluding the 10 percent surcharge and a “special additional duty” of 4 percent). The March 3 1,200O Exim Policy statement also rationalized export promotion schemes, abolished the Special Import License Scheme, and established special economic free-trade zones.

The mission broadly concurred with the authorities’ overall approach and the particular emphasis on promoting FDI inflows, which could be supported by further easing limits on foreign ownership.*’ F. Structural Policies and Other Issues 46. The authorities disagreed that the pace of structural reform had slowed in recent years. Although political instability since 1996 had complicated the process of obtaining legislative approval for some measures, important reforms had been implemented. These included new regulations governing land use and foreign exchange management, and the opening up of the insurance sector to domestic and foreign competition. Reforms in the area of telecommunications were also significant and were helping to spur growth in the service sector--domestic and international long-distance service had been liberalized and the regulatory system had been streamlined. Although a well-defined timetable for reform had not been established, the government’s objectives had been laid out in broad terms in the President’s October 1999 address, and in their view a more specific agenda and timetable would only polarize public opinion. 47. Notwithstanding recent progress, the mission cautioned that structural rigidities remained severe. These placed a significant constraint on growth and efficiency, and could leave the economy poorly placed to benefit from increased globalization. Specifically: l Labor markets: Legislation virtually prohibits layoffs in medium- and large-sized firms, and requires government participation in collective bargaining.29 The mission noted that as a result, labor market flexibility and efficiency had been severely affected, which inhibited the ability of firms to restructure and discouraged employment in the formal sector. The Indian officials acknowledged that progress in this area had been slow, which reflected concern about introducing more flexible labor practices in the absence of a social safety net. A National Labour Commission had been established in late 1999 to address legislative reforms, but was not expected to report until late 200 1. l Small-scale industries: Although the 1997 Hussain Committee recommended the elimination of reservations for small-scale industry (SSI), progress has been slow and *’ Automatic approval for FDI is limited to cases where the total does not exceed Rs 6 billion ($137 million) and sectoral ownership limits-usually 49 or 75 percent-also apply. To invest above these limits, or in sectors on the negative list, approval is required from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. 29 The Industrial Disputes Act requires that firms obtain prior approval to “retrench” employees with one or more year’s service. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - recent budgets have increased financial support for the sector.30 However, the sector is likely to come under increasing pressure with the elimination of QRs and the pending dismantlement of the multi-fiber agreement. The authorities agreed that the sequencing of reforms in this area had been less than ideal, and had been affected by political constraints and concerns about the impact of dereservation on employment. Nonetheless, they felt that policies that allowed large firms to produce goods reserved for SSIs in cases where the export or employment potential represented significant steps in the right direction. l Exit policies: The Sick Industrial Companies Act represents an important barrier to restructuring, as it provides companies protection from creditors only after their net worth has been completely eroded. Moreover, the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), which is responsible for rehabilitating or winding up companies, is widely criticized for delayin affecting bank balance sheets. 3f resolutions, undermining governance, and adversely The Indian officials acknowledged these problems and indicated that consideration was being given to amending existing legislation. l Power sector: Inefficiencies in the power sector are significant-estimates suggest that revenues cover only about 80 percent of costs, owing to transmission losses, theft, and subsidies in the form of free or low-cost power to the agricultural sector. Poor service also requires significant investment in backup generating capacity. The Indian officials agreed that the power sector was an iniportant concern, and legislation in 1998 had given states the opportunity to initiate reforms by dismantling their State Electricity Boards and privatizing or corporatizing power generation, transmission, and distribution. This process had already begun in several states-including Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Orissa-with the financial support of the World Bank. The government also had adopted policies to promote new investment in large hydro projects, and intended to establish a central authority to purchase and sell power to the states. l Agriculture: Given that the agricultural sector employs roughly 70 percent of the workforce, reforms to boost productivity and incomes are essential for poverty reduction. Large subsidies for fertilizer, power, and water not only impose a significant fiscal burden, but also promote inefficient production and environmental degradation. Administered pricing of agricultural output (including wheat, rice, and cotton), barriers to 3o Production of over 800 manufactured items are reserved for SSIs, which are defined as firms with capital of less than Rs 10 million. SSIs are responsible for roughly 40 percent of manufacturing production, including textiles, and employ 17 million people. 31 As of end-November 1999, less than 1 percent of companies referred to the BIFR had been revived. Credit outstanding to sick units was about 1 percent of GDP at end-March 1998. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - interstate trade, and limits on plot size also undermine efficiency.32 Moreover, reservation of agro-processing industry for small-scale producers also limits economies of scale. The Indian officials shared many of these concerns, but noted that liberalization would need to be accompanied by alternate vehicles for protecting agricultural incomes-the newly- introduced National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) and a credit card system for small farmers were aimed at addressing this concem.33 48. India subscribes to the SDDS, but weak data in a number of areas constrain analysis and policymaking (Annex I). This was particularly apparent with regard to information on state finances, which has impeded the ability of the central government to monitor fiscal developments at the state level on a timely basis. The Indian officials agreed that there was a need to improve statistical systems-the 1999/00 budget had called for the establishment of a National Statistical Commission to address this issue, which was due to report at end-2000. They also questioned whether India would be in a position soon to disseminate reserve data according to the new International Reserves Template, particularly given the sensitivity of data related to the maturity of forward commitments. 49. The authorities have shown a commendable participation in examinations of standards and codes. A FSSA/FSAP mission took place in March/April, and a fiscal transparency exercise also is underway. Reports are expected to be finalized midyear. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 50. In many respects, India’s economic performance in recent years has been remarkable. Despite the economic turmoil affecting the rest of the region and sharply higher oil prices, the economy has been among the fastest growing in the world, inflation has fallen sharply, and the balance of payments has strengthened. These favorable developments owe much to the deft handling of monetary policy during the regional crisis and its aftermath. More recently, too, the new government has demonstrated an encouraging willingness to take difficult decisions, raising petroleum product prices significantly and enacting key structural reforms, including in the area of insurance, telecommunications, trade liberalization, and the capital account. 51. Nonetheless, important impediments exist to the economy’s ability to maintain high growth rates and achieve the authorities’ objectives for poverty reduction. The 32 Domestic wheat procurement prices in excess of world prices have contributed to a build- up of government inventories. 33 The NAIS provides subsidized crop insurance through the Government Insurance Corporation; the Kisen Credit Card Scheme is intended to give small farmers better access to capital-a revolving bank credit line is provided, subject to limits based on the size of land holdings and a 12-month repayment requirement. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - fiscal deficit has reached unsustainable levels in recent years, crowding out private investment and contributing to rapid increases in debt and debt service that have severely limited the government’s ability to fund needed infrastructure investment and social services. Although significant advances in the areas of structural reform and deregulation have been made since the early 199Os, more rapid progress is needed in order for the private sector to reap the benefits of the increased globalization of trade and capital flows. Failure to address these issues will undermine the economy’s ability to sustain high growth, but would also leave the economy increasingly vulnerable to adverse shocks. 52. Against this background, the likelihood that the overall public sector deficit will remain over 10 percent of GDP in 2000/01 is a serious concern. The budget for the central government introduced a number of important structural measures-including tax reforms and cuts in subsidies-and gross tax receipts are projected to show an encouraging increase. It is unfortunate, however, that the opportunity was not seized to make more substantial progress toward deficit reduction. In the coming year, therefore, it will be critical to avoid slippages from budget targets, to seek opportunities for additional savings, and to avoid delaying fuel price adjustments. 53. Looking ahead, there remains a pressing need for an ambitious and time-bound program of fiscal deficit reduction. Eliminating the combined revenue deficits of the center and the states over the medium term would help assure fiscal sustainability by reversing the upward trend in the debt-to-GDP ratio, while protecting needed investments in infrastructure and social programs. The resultant reduction in the debt-service burden would also release substantial additional resources for needed social programs. However, achieving this objective will not be possible without broad-based fiscal reform. l Fiscal responsibility legislation could potentially help strengthen fiscal discipline, but would need to be coupled with strict requirements for fiscal transparency, including the publication of multi-year budget projections, credible enforcement mechanisms, and measures to ensure that these requirements are extended to the states. l Expenditure reforms by the center and states are urgently needed to support deficit reduction and to facilitate increased investments in infrastructure and social programs. Considerable savings appear possible by better targeting subsidies-especially for power, water, and railway services-and by beginning as soon as possible the sharp reduction in civil service employment that was recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission. Mechanisms need to be established to clearly identify and control off-budget activities, including contingent liabilities of both the center and the states associated with loan guarantees, government pensions, voluntary separation schemes, and insurance programs. l Tax reforms that broaden the base and correct the decline in the tax ratio that occurred during the 1990s will need to be an important part of the fiscal correction. The recent budget has taken a welcome step at reducing concessions, but the agricultural, small-scale industry, and services sectors still have to be fully integrated into the tax base. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-28 - Improvements in tax administration also are required, particularly to ensure that VATS are introduced by the center and the states without revenue losses. l Reform of center-state relations is also critical. Revisions to tax-sharing formulas could help improve the buoyancy of state revenues and increase incentives for tax reform, but recent developments illustrate that the center can, and should, play a more direct role in promoting fiscal discipline at the state level. The goal should be to encourage the states to balance their revenue deficits, including by means of additional fiscal responsibility legislation. However, the center also has scope to tighten state borrowing limits for unbudgeted increases in receipts from small savings, and to increase market discipline by raising the share of market borrowing, with clear signals that state debt is not implicitly guaranteed by the center. Well-defined and transparent mechanisms also are needed to link transfers to fiscal performance. 54. The RI31 has been effective in promoting an economic recovery while fostering low inflation. However, with the recent easing of monetary policy, the likelihood has grown that recent inflation gains will dissipate, especially given the strengthening of activity, the pickup in credit growth, and higher energy prices. These factors, and the absence of clear signs that the public sector borrowing requirement will fall in the coming year, suggest that the RBI should be prepared to act preemptively to avoid a more severe intensification of price pressures. Indeed, especially given the recent decline in global inflation, there would be considerable merit in seeking opportunities to ratchet down inflation expectations. Although the preconditions for a formal inflation target do not yet appear to be in place, the authorities’ multiple indicators approach risks leaving monetary policy without a well-defined anchor. Against this background, frequent and clear statements by the RBI of its inflation objective would help buttress the credibility of its commitment to price stability and could complement plans for fiscal responsibility legislation. 55. The staff endorses the authorities’ policy of allowing the rupee rate to respond flexibly to market conditions. This approach served India well during the recent regional crisis and its continuation in the period ahead will allow the real effective exchange rate to reflect changing circumstances, including progress toward trade liberalization, the stance of fiscal policy, and shifts in the external environment and investor sentiment. This underscores the importance of avoiding excessive stability of the exchange rate against a single currency, as the experience of other countries in recent years illustrates that this can undermine incentives for market participants to engage in active risk management and could create conditions for a build-up of speculative pressures. 56. Considerable progress has been made in reforming the financial sector during the past decade, but further challenges remain. Quick and decisive action to reduce the government’s stake in public’ sector banks and to deal with weak banks is necessary to improve governance and the efficient allocation of saving. It will also be important to maintain the momentum toward strengthening prudential and supervisory systems, including by bringing prudential norms fully up to international standards, establishing a framework for intervening in undercapitalized banks, and ensuring effective implementation of existing Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - regulations. Recent initiatives to strengthen debt recovery mechanisms are welcome, and it will be critical to ensure that debt recovery tribunals are provided with the requisite resources and legal mandate to operate effectively. 57. Recent initiatives in the area of trade liberalization-especially the planned elimination of quantitative import restrictions- have been encouraging and this momentum will need to be maintained. The authorities’ commitment to further lower tariffs-which are still too high-is welcome, and the fiscal impact could be mitigated by improvements in customs administration and the withdrawal of exemptions. At the same time, it will be essential to resist pressures to resort to other forms of nontariff protection, including anti-dumping and countervailing measures. The authorities’ cautious approach to capital account liberalization appears appropriate, but there would appear scope for further increasing foreign direct investment inflows, including by continued easing of foreign ownership restrictions. 58. Structural reform continues to be an urgent priority. The agricultural sector remains the economy’s largest employer, and productivity and incomes will need to be boosted by easing restrictions on plot size and agro-processing, eliminating constraints on interstate trade, withdrawing subsidies on power, water, and fertilizers, and rationalizing the system of minimum support prices. Priority also needs to be placed on unshackling the industrial sector from restrictive labor laws, reservations for small-scale industry, and ineffective bankruptcy provisions. Reform of the pension system also appears warranted in view of the need to ensure that savings for retirement are adequate, but it will be important to bring the returns on provident funds and postal savings closer in line with market yields and to ensure that new savings instruments do not result in a liability to the government. 59. The authorities’ subscription to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard is commendable. However, data shortcomings remain a significant impediment to economic analysis and policy making, and the authorities are encouraged to place a greater emphasis on addressing these issues in the period ahead. 60. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with India take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

India has elaborate systems for the compilation of economic and financial statistics, and produces a vast quantity of data covering all sectors of the economy. Important progress has been made in recent years in the publication of key economic data as India has moved to meet its commitments under the SDDS. Many key financial variables are available on a weekly or monthly basis, most of which are published in official documents or disseminated through press releases. Nevertheless, the statistical system suffers from a number of weaknesses: l Statistical methods are cumbersome, and reporting methods have not kept pace with the shift to a more market-oriented economy following the elimination of industrial licensing. Computerization of data systems is being introduced slowly. l Decentralization of data collection means that the Central Statistical Office has little control over statistical techniques used in other agencies. This greatly complicates the task of achieving consistency across the sectoral accounts. 0 There are still shortcomings in terms of the timeliness, periodicity, coverage, and quality of many data series. 2. Recent developments, and the most important shortcomings in the areas of national accounts, price statistics, balance of payments, and government finance are discussed below: l National accounts: The CSO has recently rebased the annual national accounts statistics and has started publishing quarterly data. However, the new annual data are only available from 1993/94, and quarterly data are only available from 199642. Also, data are subject to substantial revisions, and information on major expenditure categories is only available with considerable delay (at least ten months after the end of the fiscal year). Saving and investment estimates are particularly weak, reflecting an outdated estimation method and a lack of information on activity outside the organized sector of the economy. l Price statistics: There are three consumer price indices (CPIs), each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and nonmanual employees, and agricultural laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month, and greater reliance is placed on the wholesale price index, which is published weekly with a lag of about two weeks. Although the weights for the WPI have recently been revised, the weights used in the calculation of the consumer price indices are more than fifteen years old, and include several commodities that are virtually obsolete. l Balance of payments: A significant improvement has been made to the timeliness of the quarterly balance of payments data, which are now released with a lag of three Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - ANNEX I months.’ However, trade data, which are currently based on an international transactions reporting system (ITRS), have valuation, timing, and coverage problems. As the exchange control regime is relaxed, there is a risk that the quality of ITRS statistics will decline. Further, information on trade prices and volumes is not available on a timely basis. External debt statistics are calculated on a quarterly basis, but are published only three times a year. Fiscal operations: The Ministry of Finance posts monthly fiscal data and quarterly debt data of the central government on its website. However, information on fiscal performance at the state level is available only with a 9-month lag, while consolidated information is unavailable on state enterprises and local government operations. In addition, although data on the functional and economic classification of expenditures are available, the typical presentation of fiscal accounts does not provide a particularly useful classification for macroeconomic analysis. For example, the classification of government expenditure between plan/non-plan and developmental/non-developmental and obscures the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. I The STA missions that visited India in December 1996, and in November/December 1997 have made comprehensive recommendations to improve the timeliness, scope, and classification of India’s balance of payments statistics.

India is one of the largest borrowers from the World Bank Group. The Bank’s program of assistance comprises a diversified lending program and considerable ongoing economic and sector work (ESW). The ESW includes completed or planned reports on macroeconomic and state fiscal management issues; on sector-level reforms (agriculture, education, environment, finance, health, nutrition); and on poverty. The Comprehensive Development Review (the Bank’s first), completed in June 1999, covers the fiscal and structural constraints to achieving high, sustained growth, with particular emphasis on poverty, health and education, governance, and private participation in infrastructure. Lending from IBRD, IDA, and the IFC seeks to support poverty reduction, acceleration of human resource and infrastructure development, and the reform process at the state level. Particular emphasis is being made on leading reforming states. A multi-sectoral investment loan was approved in mid-1998 to support state-level fiscal reform in Andhra Pradesh. A similar program of assistance, comprising a development program loan (sub-national adjustment loan) and sectoral investment operations to support comprehensive reforms in Uttar Pradesh was approved in April 2000. Other states have also shown strong interest in programs supporting state level reforms. 2.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with India On June 16, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with India.’ Background During the past decade, India has been among the fastest growing economies in the world. The economy recovered rapidly from a balance of payments crisis in 1991-in large part reflecting a favorable supply response to structural reforms-and growth reached in excess of 7 percent in the mid-l 990s. The economy also weathered the Asian crisis well, owing to a strong external position, flexible exchange rate management, and long-standing capital account restrictions. While economic activity slowed in 1997/98, in the subsequent two years growth recovered, inflation eased, and the external position remained comfortable. Although real GDP growth is estimated to have moderated to 6 percent in 1999/2000, from 6% percent in 1998/99, this reflected a slowing of agricultural production after the previous year’s bumper harvest. Activity in the industrial and services sectors strengthened during the year, buoyed by a revival of exports and a pickup in domestic demand resulting from improved agricultural incomes and continued fiscal stimulus. Wholesale price inflation fell to 3 percent in 1999/00-an 18-year low, largely in response to improved supply conditions for a number of key agricultural commodities. More recently, however, hikes in administered prices of fuel and commodities have led to a rebound in inflation to 4% percent in March 2000 (12-month basis). ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

Despite the subsequent sharp rise in oil prices, the current account deficit is estimated to have increased only to around 1% percent of GDP in 1999100, reflecting a strong recovery of merchandise exports and continued sluggishness in non-oil imports. Private capital inflows, which had dipped in response to the financial market turmoil in the region as well as to international sanctions imposed in early 1998, recovered strongly in 1999 and into 2000, spurred in part by global investor demand for information-technology (IT) stocks. As a result, gross foreign exchange reserves have risen steadily and reached over $38 billion (more than six months of imports of goods and services) at end-March 2000. The fiscal position has deteriorated significantly in recent years, erasing much of the consolidation that was achieved following the 1991 balance of payments crisis. The deficit of the consolidated public sector-defined to include the central and state governments, central public enterprises, and the oil pool account-increased steadily from 8% percent of GDP in 1995196 to an estimated 11 percent of GDP in 1999/00, reflecting deterioration at both the central and state levels. Slippages from the central government’s 1999/00 budget were especially severe, with the center’s deficit reaching 7 percent of GDP, compared with a budget target of 5% percent of GDP. * The shortfall reflected unanticipated military outlays related to the Kargil border dispute, the lingering effects of the 1997 Fifth Pay Commission awards on pension outlays, increased food subsidies, and higher interest payments. The states’ fiscal deficit is estimated to have reached 4% percent of GDP in 1999/00, mainly owing to pressures to match central government pay awards and to growing debt service payments. In addition, delays in raising energy prices also eroded the surplus of the oil pool account. The central government’s 2000/01 budget suggested that little or no deficit reduction would be achieved in the coming year-measures to raise gross tax receipts and cut food and fettilizer subsidies were offset by increased military outlays and transfers to the states, leaving the central government’s deficit close to 7 percent of GDP in 2000/01. However, important reforms to the tax system were introduced: the number of tariff bands was reduced, the excise tax system was moved closer to a single-rate VAT, and the phased elimination of the exemption of export income from taxation was begun. With pressures on the exchange rate having abated by late 1998, the focus of monetary policy shifted toward supporting the industrial recovery. In early 1999, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the banks’ cash reserve requirement (CRR) by 1 percent and the Bank Rate and repo rates were lowered by I and 2 percentage points, respectively. In October, the RBI introduced a further 1% percentage point reduction in the CRR, and on April 1, 2000, the RBI announced an additional I percentage point cut in the Bank rate, the repo rate, and the CRR. These latter * The staffs definition of the deficit differs from the official definition in that it includes onlending of small savings deposits to the states as an expenditure item, and excludes divestment receipts from revenues.
