Falling cotton prices, overvalued official exchange rates, and continued large debt service payments, all set in a framework of a stalled structural reform program, put pressure on the balance of payments and added to inflationary pressures. The authorities intensified economic reforms during the year. In their view, the significantly diminished terrorist threat following the change of regime in Afghanistan presented them with a unique opportunity to speed up their reform efforts. The authorities made several changes to the foreign exchange regime during the year and formulated a comprehensive macroeconomic and structural reform program in cooperation with Fund staff during the Article IV consultation mission in December 2001. The measures envisaged for the first half of 2002 will be monitored under a Staff Monitored Program (SMP). Key Policy Issues The key policy issues are: (i) tighter fiscal and monetary policies; (ii) balance of payments and external debt problems; (iii) liberalization of the foreign exchange regime; and (iv) a speeding up of structural reforms, in particular in the agricultural sector. As called for by Executive Directors last year, the authorities have formulated an economic reform program that has formed the basis for a SMP. The program needs to be implemented forcefully and consistently so that the SMP can pave the way for financial assistance from the Fund and from other IFIs and bilateral creditors. The authorities will need to adhere to the spirit of the program and implement decisively formal decrees, resolutions and instructions. Too often there have been large discrepancies between such regulations and how they are implemented in the economy, particularly with respect to the foreign exchange system. Accordingly, the staff has adopted an “outcome based” approach whereby the degree of liberalization of the foreign exchange system will be judged by the narrowing of the spread between the OTC and curb market exchange rates. To achieve the envisaged tight macroeconomic policies in the fiscal area, the authorities will need to show wage restraint and to keep within the agreed limits assistance to enterprises strained by the reform process. As for monetary policy, interest rates will have to be adjusted to ensure that they are positive in real terms. The wide divergences between official statistics and alternative indicators with respect to national account and consumer price data will have to be narrowed significantly before a financial arrangement with the Fund can be contemplated. Such differences complicate a meaningful analysis of economic developments and the policy dialogue. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- 1. INTRODUCTION 1. A mission visited Tashkent during December 3-14,200l to conduct the 2001 Article IV consultation discussions. ’ 2 The mission also formulated together with the authorities a staff monitored program (SMP) covering the first half of 2002.3 The mission met with Mr. Azimov, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Macroeconomics and Statistics; Mr. Nurmuradov, Minister of Finance; Mr. Mulladjanov, Chairman of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan; and other senior officials and members of the diplomatic and business community. 2. The last Article IV consultation was completed on February 7,200l (SUWOl/l 1). At that meeting, Directors regretted that there had been little change in the non-market orientation of the government’s economic policy, especially its adherence to the complex and burdensome multiple exchange rate regime. Directors acknowledged the authorities’ concerns about the risks of reform, but did not accept their argument that the initiation of a liberalization program would require large up-front financing. However, if such a program were implemented forcefully and consistently, it could form the basis for a staff monitored program (SMP) and, in due course, pave the way for financial support from the Fund. Directors stressed that liberalization of the foreign exchange regime should be a key element in any reform package. Finally, Directors noted with concern the weakness of official statistics, which makes it difficult to analyze economic developments, and they urged the authorities to show their commitment to the production of high quality data by implementing the recommendations of earlier technical assistance missions. 3. In 2001, the Uzbek authorities expressed renewed interest in cooperating with the Fund. During a staff visit in July/August, they established together with the staff a macroeconomic program covering the second half of 2001. In connection with the Article IV consultation discussions in December 2001, a SMP covering the first half of 2002 was elaborated, with the aim of establishing a track record that could pave the way for a financial arrangement with the Fund. The authorities also hoped that such a program would send a ’ The staff team comprised Messrs. Hansen (head), Zavoico, Jafarov, Pani, Ms. Ohnsorge (EP) (all EU2), and Mr. Chemov (Interpreter-TGS). The mission was assisted by Ms. Kostina, the office manager/research assistant in the IMF office in Tashkent. Mr. Szczuka, the Alternate Executive Director for Uzbekistan, participated in some of the meetings as an observer. 2 Relations with the Fund are described in Appendix I and those with the World Bank in Appendix II. 3 The SMP was circulated for information of the Executive Board on February 4,2002 as EBS/02/19.

Although Uzbekistan continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, it maintains a number of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval (Box 1). In keeping with the authorities’ reform program, several restrictive practices were relaxed and the exchange rate structure rationalized somewhat during the course of 2001 and in early 2002. Box 1. Exchange Restrictions and Multiple Currency Practices Uzbekistan currently maintains the following exchange rate restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4: (i) a restriction arising from foreign exchange rationing implemented through the identification of low priority goods not eligible to receive foreign exchange from the official exchange markets and delays in central bank approval of applications for foreign exchange; (ii) foreign exchange rationing implemented through allocations of foreign exchange for medical supplies and “socially significant” consumer goods; (iii) a multiple currency practice arising from the segmentation of the exchange market, resulting in large differences between the over-the-counter (OTC), official CBU, and cash bureau exchange rates; (iv) a restriction on the making of advance payments to certain specified offshore territories and on the making of payments under contract for works (services) to such offshore territories; (v) a restriction on the making of payments to non-residents that are not party to import contracts; (vi) a restriction arising from the requirement that importers who wish to purchase foreign exchange to make an advance payment under an import contract must make an advance sum deposit the equal to 100 percent of the advance payment. This deposit is released only after the importer presents to the bank a certified original of the document confirming that the goods have actually been imported; (vii) a restriction arising from the imposition of a ceiling on the amount of interest and other payments provided for in loan contracts with non-residents that can be paid in the fulfillment of such legally valid loan contracts (a maximum of 20 percent per annum of principal outstanding); (viii) a restriction on the amount of foreign exchange which residents may purchase for the purpose of making invisible payments; and (ix) a restriction limiting the amount of foreign exchange which can be purchased by nonresident individuals to the amounts earlier exchanged for sums. II. RECENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 5. In the wake of the events of September 11, Uzbekistan’s long-standing concerns about international terrorism were translated into close political and military cooperation with the United States. Subsequent developments in Afghanistan have substantially mitigated the Uzbek government’s concerns regarding terrorist threats and internal security. 6. In a national referendum on January 27,2002, the creation of a bicameral parliament and the extension of the presidential term from five to seven years were approved by an overwhelming majority. The bicameral parliament will be established at the next parliamentary elections (December 2004) and is intended to give greater voice to regional interests. The extension of the presidential term will apply beginning with the next term, which starts January 2004. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- 7. The macroeconomic situation in Uzbekistan was already difficult before the September 11 attacks and subsequently deteriorated further. Falling cotton prices, overvalued official exchange rates, and continued heavy debt service payments, together with stalled structural reforms, put pressure on the balance of payments and added to inflationary pressures during the first eight months of the year. The weakening of the global economy post-September 11, in particular the negative impact on commodity prices, further weakened the Uzbek economy toward the end of the year. 8. While official statistics continue to portray healthy, and even accelerating, economic growth and high, but stable inflation, these statistics do not paint an accurate picture of true developments. As described in Box 2, alternative staff estimates suggest lower real GDP growth and higher consumer price inflation than official statistics. The mission agreed to the authorities’ request to use historical official statistics as a basis for the discussions (as reflected in Tables l-5 and Figure l), but nevertheless took into account its alternative estimates in the analysis of economic developments and in its projections and policy recommendations. According to official data, real GDP grew by 4% percent in 2001, owing mainly to rapid growth in retail trade and in new small industries and a better cotton harvest (Table 1). However, alternative staff estimates suggest that real GDP growth was just over 3 ‘/z percent. Official consumer price inflation during 200 1 was 26 percent, somewhat less than the year before. According to staff estimates, inflation was about 54 percent or somewhat higher than in 2000. In the staffs view, this rate is more plausible than the official inflation rate, given the large annual wage increase granted by the government in August (40 percent) and the 68 percent depreciation of the curb market exchange rate during 200 1. The curb market rate is being used in the market as the basis for pricing most consumer goods. 9. The balance of payments and external debt situation deteriorated further in 2001 (Table 5). According to preliminary estimates, the current account balance weakened sharply, mainly because of the decline in world prices for cotton. A sharp increase in imports of machinery and intermediate goods was mainly offset by a compression of consumer good and non-strategic imports primarily through limiting access to foreign exchange. A current account deficit of about % of 1 percent of GDP is estimated for 2001, compared with a sizable surplus the year before. Net drawdowns on public and publicly-guaranteed debt were partly offset by unrecorded capital outflows, and a small overall balance of payments deficit was recorded. As a result, gross international reserves declined by about US$60 million. In relation to imports of goods and nonfactor services, reserve coverage fell to 4.7 months from 5.2 months the year before. Outstanding external debt continued to climb in relation to GDP in 2001, reaching 41 percent (65 percent when measured at the indicative exchange rate).4 Partly as a result of lower world interest rates, debt service payments relative to exports of goods and nonfactor services rose only marginally in 2001, 4 The indicative exchange rate is calculated as a weighted average of the official exchange rate, the over-the-counter (OTC) rate, the cash market rate, and the curb market rate.

Uzbekistan: Alternative Measures of CPI and Real GDP I The official consumer price index and real GDP data have not adequately reflected the extent of price increases and economic growth over the past few years. The major reasons are, as mentioned in past staff reports, technical deficiencies in the compilation and computation of price and national accounts data and the politically sensitive nature of consumer price and real GDP statistics. Based on technical assistance recommendations from the IMF and other providers, on which there has been insufficient follow-up by the authorities, the mission reestimated consumer price and national accounts statistics for the period 1997-2001. As indicated in the table below, the revised estimates show lower, albeit still positive, growth of real GDP and much higher consumer price inflation than official data. In general, these alternative indicators correspond better to other economic indicators than official statistics, as shown in Figure 2.

The government took significant administrative measures to streamline the foreign exchange regime during 2001 and in early 2002 as preparatory steps to the envisaged introduction of current account convertibility later in 2002 (Box 3). The principal reforms in 2001 were carried out in two phases. The main change during the first phase from July onward was to limit transactions effected at the official exchange rate to debt service payments on existing external debt and the surrender of proceeds from centralized exports. In the second phase, the official and the OTC exchange rates were unified on November 1 and all authorized non-cash transactions were effected at the new unified rate (except, temporarily, the proceeds surrendered from centralized exports).5 However, the measures described in Box 3 do not appear to have eased access to foreign exchange significantly, partly because banks in some cases appear to have continued to administer the foreign exchange regime based on the preJuly 1 framework and also because of continued official manipulation of the OTC and cash exchange markets. This has been evidenced by the sharp widening of the spread between the OTC and the curb market exchange rates from 35 percent in early July to 116 percent at the end of the year. 11. Fiscal policy continued to be relatively tight until the last few months of 2001 (Tables 2a and 2b). The government’s limited scope for non-inflationary deficit financing forced the authorities to match declining revenues by expenditure restraint.6 Revenues fell mainly because of significantly weaker excise taxes as the government reduced excise rates for energy companies to help them meet their debt obligations. Revenues from VAT also fell, owing to the decline in imports, and corporate income tax revenues fell modestly owing to a reduction in the tax rate from 3 1 percent to 26 percent. The expenditure compression affected mainly centralized investments, expenditures on the economy (primarily maintenance of the capital stock), and to some extent socio-cultural expenditures (health, education, arts, etc.). However, the fiscal restraint was partially reversed by large wage increases granted in August and by the special loan program adopted in October to support enterprises hardest hit by the 200 1 exchange regime reforms7 During the fourth quarter, these loans amounted to about 5 A summary of the segmentation of the exchange rate regime is set out in Appendix IV. 6 The fiscal data exclude quasi-fiscal activities that continue to play a major role in the Uzbek economy, but for which no precise estimates are available. These include directed lending and the implicit taxation of exports and subsidization of imports and other payments abroad (mainly debt service) through the distorted foreign exchange regime. 7 Under Cabinet of Ministers’ Resolution No. 423 adopted on October 25,2001, the government will partly compensate enterprises in priority sectors for devaluation losses on debt service payments (and in certain instances import payments) in the form of loans. The sources of finance include the revaluation gains on the gold and foreign exchange holdings of the CBU. These funds are lent (interest free) by the CBU to the government which on-lends them to eligible enterprises. Loans are to be repaid by enterprises within a period of 3 years.

Main Elements of Foreign Exchange Regime Reforms in 2001 and 2002 The Uzbek government took a series of measures starting in July 2001 to reform the foreign exchange regime. The key measures were: Effective July 1,200l: . Established a free floating “over-the-counter”(OTC) market for foreign exchange with the rate determined by supply and demand (although both supply and demand have in fact been administered through informal channels); . Transferred all transactions, except debt service on government and government-guaranteed foreign exchange loans contracted before July 1,200 1 and the surrender of proceeds from centralized exports, from the official to the OTC exchange rate; . Abolished the surrender requirement for SMEs exporting their own products; . Shifted the 50 percent surrender requirement for non-strategic exports from the official to the OTC exchange rate; . Abolished the 5 percent tax on the purchase of foreign exchange; and . Abolished the requirement for nonresidents to pay for many services in convertible currencies, although payment for travel services by nonresidents must still be settled in convertible currencies. Effective August 1,200l: . Abolished the system of licenses and quotas for consumer goods and replaced it with guaranteed access within quarterly limits for imports of socially significant consumer goods (hitherto, the issuance of licenses had been highly restrictive). Commercial banks were tasked with allocating foreign exchange for other consumer goods, but with a negative list of goods for which allocation of foreign exchange is not recommended; . Abolished the system of quotas for imported inputs and replaced it with procedures administered by the Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics (MMS) and commercial banks to ensure that imports for which foreign exchange were requested are consistent with projections pre-approved by the MMS.

Overall, the budget deficit (according to the IMF definition) amounted to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2001, or slightly higher than in 2000. Financing came primarily from external sources, with net borrowing from the CBU limited to about 0.7 percent of GDP.’ Proceeds from privatization were negligible. 12. Monetary policy was initially relatively tight but was loosened significantly during the second half of 2001 (Box 4). Monetary developments were affected by the sharp depreciation of the official exchange rate, which resulted in instability in velocity and the money multiplier (Figure 3). The CBU limited credit to both the government and to the private sector through June with the aim of creating favorable conditions for the planned exchange regime reforms on July 1 (Tables 3 and 4). In this effort, it was assisted by a modest budgetary financing requirement (due largely to seasonal factors). However, following the first step devaluation of the official exchange rate on July 1, many enterprises (especially in the state sector) faced liquidity problems, which were exacerbated by the large August wage increase and later by the second step devaluation on November 1. The CBU relaxed access to credit gradually, with the result that growth of monetary aggregates accelerated toward the end of the year.’ Additional credit was made available to the government in December for on-lending to enterprises under Resolution No. 423 and this served to relax credit conditions further. The easing of monetary policy was reflected in the curb market exchange rate, which started to depreciate in July. During the second half of the year it depreciated by about 63 percent, following a depreciation of only 3% percent during the first half of the year (Figure 4). The interest rate policy of the CBU also contributed to the slack monetary conditions. Its refinance rate was severely negative in real terms throughout the year (when measured at a realistic inflation rate). 13. A number of prices continue to be subject to state control. Such prices are either set explicitly or through profit margin regulations for a limited number of staples (e.g., flour, vegetable oil), or are regulated for a much larger number of products through anti-monopoly legislation.” This legislation limits the scope for enterprises to either raise prices (to avoid ’ Gross borrowing from the CBU amounted to 0.7 percent of GDP. This exceeded the official annual cap of 0.5 percent of GDP on credit to the government from the CBU by the amount of lending undertaken pursuant to Resolution No. 423. 9 The growth of broad money, including foreign currency deposits, was 54 percent during 2001. However, the July 1 and November 1 step devaluations substantially inflated the valuation of the foreign currency deposit component of broad money. Excluding foreign currency deposits, the growth of broad money was 45 percent. lo Anti-monopoly regulation takes the form of controls over monopolies and monopoly products at both national and regional levels (see Table 16 of the accompanying Statistical Appendix).

The program of structural reform made little headway during 2001. The government announced in November 1998 an ambitious program of large-scale privatization and this was supplemented in 2000 and 2001 by further legislation targeting the communications, energy, and financial sectors for early sale. However, interest has been modest. The general economic environment remains too restrictive and non-transparent to make the sale of state-owned enterprises appealing to either foreign or domestic investors, especially since in most cases only minority stakes are offered. Negligible progress has been made in reforming the financial sector. Banks are still serving largely as conduits for state- directed credits and most loans are guaranteed by the government.*’ Little progress has been made in the implementation of a treasury. The government is, however, seeking international technical assistance, including from the World Bank, to improve the management of public finances. i1 Non-government guaranteed loans have mainly been credits to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Bank lending to SMEs started to be heavily promoted by the government in 200 1, including through legislation requiring banks to process SME loan applications within 10 days. Many SME loans have been financed through credit lines extended to commercial banks by IFIs. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-15- Figure 3.

Its detailed crop plan implemented down to the level of private farms and payment for crops mandated at prices well below international market levels continue to hamper agricultural development.12 The growth of a private sector cotton ginning industry has been handicapped by mechanisms that ensure that virtually the entire cotton crop is acquired by state ginneries. Although there has been some restructuring of large collective farms into smaller units, these remain subject to the same crop and price constraints as the large units, except for individual (dekhan) farms. III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS A. Background 16. Cooperation between the Uzbek authorities and Fund staff improved significantly during 2001. For the first time in many years, the authorities formulated a comprehensive economic program in cooperation with the Fund staff during a staff visit in July/August which was reflected in a memorandum of economic and financial policies forwarded by the authorities to the Managing Director in mid-August. This proved to be useful in facilitating the discussions of a SMP during the Article IV consultation mission in December 2001, when the authorities were keen to improve their cooperation with the Fund. In the authorities’ view, the significantly diminished terrorist threat facing Uzbekistan following the change of regime in Afghanistan presented them with a unique opportunity to speed up their reform efforts. The authorities recognize that the slow pace of economic reform over the past few years has contributed to their difficulties in dealing with the external shocks they have faced recently and that they need to take bold steps to open up the economy. However, they continue to favor a deliberate pace of reform, which in their view would help soften the decline in GDP and tax revenues experienced by other transition economies in the early stages of the reform process. While the staff understands the reasons for such an approach, it emphasized that early and bold reform measures were needed to enable Uzbekistan to catch up with the more advanced transition economies. 17. In addition to the regular Article IV consultation issues, the December 2001 mission discussions focused on the policy measures to be included in a SMP covering the first half of 2002. In view of the less-than-satisfactory performance under the August program (partly because of the economic impact of the September 11 events), the SMP included a number of prior actions, including quantitative macroeconomic benchmarks for end-December 200 1. Following verification that the prior actions had been observed, the l2 The World Bank estimates that in 2000 the state order system led to a transfer of resources from agriculture to the rest of the economy equivalent to about 5 percent of GDP and was a major contributor to rural poverty.

The authorities hope that the implementation of the SMP will demonstrate their commitment to reform to the international community and enable them to establish an economic program beyond mid-2002 that could be supported by financial resources from the IMF. Although the authorities accepted that financial assistance from the IMF would not be possible until the second half of the year, they hoped that a determined implementation of the SMP could help them obtain financial assistance from other international financial institutions and bilateral creditors already during the first half of the year. B. Key Elements of the Government’s Program for 2002 19. The discussions of the SMP for the first half of 2002 were set within the framework of the government’s program for the year as a whole. While the discussion focused on the specifics of the SMP, it also addressed in broad terms the main features of a successor program that could be supported by the use of Fund resources. l4 The key elements of the SMP framework are described in Box 5. The specific quantitative targets and structural benchmarks for the first half of 2002 are specified in Tables 1 and 2 of the MEP attached to the authorities’ letter of January 3 1,2002 (EBS/OYl 9).r5 20. The authorities clearly understood that it was crucial to pursue tight monetary and fiscal policies in 2002. They recognized that such policies would be essential to prevent a destabilizing depreciation of the OTC exchange rate as the exchange regime is being liberalized. At the same time, they felt that key sectors of the economy would need to be supported through this transition period. They agreed with the mission that any such assistance should be channeled through the budget and be temporary. l3 In a letter to the Managing Director dated December 19,2001, President Karimov expressed his support for the program that had been established, ad referendum, during the December mission. l4 See paragraphs 16-22 of the MEP attached to the authorities’ letter of January 3 1,2002 (EBS/02/19). l5 Since the SMP was circulated, additional economic information has become available. Some of the macroeconomic indicators described in this report may therefore differ from those in the SMP documents.

Liberalizing the foreign exchange regime progressively with the aim of introducing current account convertibility during an eventual successor financial arrangement with the Fund; . Limiting the budget deficit in 2002 to 3.6 percent of GDP, including financial assistance to priority sectors hardest hit by the 2001 devaluations; . Conducting a tight monetary policy to support the move to current account convertibility, including by keeping the refinance rate under review and adjusting it as necessary to ensure that it is positive in real terms; . Initiating reform of the state order system for cotton and grain by raising procurement prices to world market levels and giving farmers greater scope to sell their crop as they wish; . Improving conditions for the development of the financial sector through the elimination of directed credits, ceasing official interference in bank operations, and gradually removing restrictions on the use of cash by enterprises and individuals; . Increasing the transparency of the CBU by an audit of its 2001 accounts by an international audit firm and strengthening its role by transferring the management of all international reserves to the CBU; . Providing greater scope for prices in the allocation of resources by reducing the role of anti-monopoly legislation in price formation; . Streamlining trade by reducing obstacles to both exports and imports; and . Improving the collection and processing of macroeconomic statistics by implementing technical assistance already provided by the Fund. 21. As liberalization of the exchange system proceeds, the CBU intends to make a transition to a floating exchange rate regime. The authorities intend to achieve this objective through a combination of lifting formal restrictions on exchange operations and by gradually relaxing the informal administrative mechanisms that have been used to regulate supply and demand in the OTC market. They began this process in January 2002 by taking some limited liberalization measures.16 Further measures are scheduled to be taken later in 2002. These measures will include streamlining procedures associated with the ex ante registration of import contracts, which have been used as a means of restricting access to foreign exchange. The mission stressed that the success of the liberalization process will be best measured by developments in the spread between the exchange rates in the OTC market and the curb market, as this spread reflects the extent to which trading is forced onto the curb market because of restrictions on access to the OTC market. This spread was 116 percent at end-200 1. If the spread were to exceed 50 percent at end-March 2002 and 20 percent at end- June 2002, the staff would consider this as an indication that there has been insufficient l6 These measures included allowing enterprises in operation less than six months to participate in the OTC market, reducing from 61 to 46 the list of consumer goods for which the provision of foreign exchange is “not recommended”, increasing the access limit for individuals in the cash bureaus to US$750 per transaction, and reducing the surrender requirement to 50 percent for all non-cotton strategic exports.

The authorities agreed that the objective of reducing the spread should be achieved through liberalization rather than through any systematic intervention in the curb market. The authorities aim to achieve near current account convertibility by end-June, although the existence of capital account restrictions and tax avoidance considerations would probably still result in the curb market rate being somewhat more depreciated than the official rate throughout the second half of the year. The authorities aim to enter into a financial arrangement with the Fund during the second half of 2002 and in that context accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. 22. Discussions relating to fiscal policy focused on the financing of the 2002 budget and the implementation of Resolution No. 423 with respect to financial support for enterprises. The authorities argued that they would have to balance the requirement of a tight fiscal policy in 2002, to support their broader macroeconomic objectives, against the need to support priority sectors hurt by the devaluation and the liberalization of the foreign exchange and trade regimes. Moreover, socially vulnerable groups would also require some transitory support. A balance was struck whereby the “core” deficit would increase somewhat compared to the year before to 3.1 percent of GDP (IMF definition), reflecting both the economic slowdown and increased socio-economic spending. l7 Although the authorities initially favored making generous transfers of resources to enterprises under Resolution No. 423, they recognized the importance of limiting such assistance to avoid compromising their broader macroeconomic objectives. Consistent with this aim, the authorities agreed that such assistance in 2002 would be provided in amounts not to exceed 0.5 percent of GDP, and that the overall deficit in 2002 would be limited to 3.6 percent of GDP (against 2.3 percent in 2001). This deficit would be covered by: l CBU financing equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP (including assistance under Resolution 423); l external borrowing equivalent to 1.4 percent of GDP; and l privatization receipts and treasury bill financing equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP. This leaves a financing gap of 0.5 percent of GDP. The authorities intend to fill this gap with external assistance. If such assistance does not materialize in the amounts expected, the authorities are committed to implement both revenue-raising and expenditure-reducing measures to close the gap. The specifics of such measures, if needed, will be discussed in the context of the reviews of the SMP. l7 The “core” deficit is the consolidated budget deficit excluding Resolution 423 - related operations.

The amounts to be provided from the budget will likely cover only a rather modest part of the additional costs to enterprises of the envisaged reform program, which will arise from the depreciation of the exchange rate, the phasing out of directed credits at subsidized interest rates, and price decontrol. The hardest hit are likely to be large state-owned enterprises, but smaller firms that have relied heavily on external financing and cater exclusively to the domestic market are also likely to be adversely affected. No estimates have been made available of the financial condition of the enterprise sector and thus an evaluation of the precise burden that these reforms will impose cannot be made. However, in the staffs view, it is likely to be considerable. The authorities will thus face some hard choices concerning the future of a number of enterprises. 24. The authorities recognized the key role monetary policy will have to play in containing inflation and avoiding disruptive exchange rate movements in 2002. It is assumed that the unexpected decline in velocity and increase in the money multiplier in late 200 1 related to the exchange rate depreciation will be reversed in 2002. Accordingly, velocity is assumed to increase by about 8 percent and the multiplier to decline by about 5 percent during the year. The CBU raised the refinance rate from 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent a month (or from 26.8 percent to 34.5 percent on a cumulative annual basis) effective January 1,2002, and it agreed to adjust the rate as necessary in 2002 to ensure that it is positive in real terms. The CBU also intends to make more active use of its CD market to help it meet its NDA ceilings, which should also contribute to a deepening of the interbank market. The tight credit policies are expected to limit the decline in net international reserves of the CBU to about US$SO million during 2002. 25. To support the transition to a more market oriented environment, the authorities agreed that it was important to strengthen the role of the CBU in managing the international reserves of Uzbekistan. The responsibility for the management of international reserves is currently split between the CBU and the National Bank for Foreign Economic Activity (NBFEA). At end-2001, each was managing about half of total reserves. To improve the transparency of reserve management and to centralize financial operations within one institution, it was agreed that the CBU would transfer all reserves currently managed by the NBFEA to its own accounts as related contracts with the NBFEA mature. Based on the maturity structure of these assets, more than half of all reserves now managed by the NBFEA would be shifted to the CBU by end-2002, and the transfer would be essentially completed by end-2003. 26. The authorities argued that the commercial banking system remains strong (based on prudential ratios), but acknowledged the importance of enhancing the role of commercial banks as financial intermediaries. They favored moving forward with a combination of removing restrictions on bank operations (especially regarding the use of cash), eliminating the role of the state in directing credits, and privatizing the larger state- dominated banks. The mission argued that pervasive restrictions on cash withdrawals have resulted in many enterprises conducting the bulk of their operations in cash (including U.S. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - dollars) which has inhibited the development of the banking system.18 The authorities cautioned that since their tax administration continues to rely heavily on the direct collection of taxes from enterprise bank accounts, a complete and immediate relaxation of cash restrictions could adversely affect tax revenues. However, they agreed to a progressive easing of the restrictions, accompanied by a parallel strengthening of tax administration. With regard to the elimination of directed credits, the authorities felt that, in the absence of a developed interbank market, it was too early to switch to a market-based system of money and credit management. Instead, the CBU would allocate credit through a system of competitive credit auctions as an interim measure. The authorities are also proceeding with their ambitious plan to privatize the largest banks. The mission cautioned that interest by foreign and domestic investors would be limited unless the operating environment was made more transparent and less restrictive, progress was made on liberalizing the exchange rate system, and the financial status of the banks on the privatization list was clarified. As Box 6 shows, it is difficult to assess the soundness of the banking system. Although all banks met their prudential requirements at the end of 2001, this was mainly because the vast majority of loans are government guaranteed and thus carry zero risk weighting in the calculation of capital adequacy. Nevertheless, the loan portfolio of banks in 2001 appears to have deteriorated somewhat, probably because of the impact of the depreciation of the official exchange rate. 27. The authorities place great emphasis on deepening the reform of the agricultural sector, initially by improving the operation of the state procurement system for cotton and grain. They intend to pursue a two-pronged approach, involving better pricing and encouraging the development of a private sector market for cotton and grain. Procurement prices for cotton and grain will be set at world market levels starting with the 2002 harvest, after allowing for normal processing, marketing, and transportation costs. At the same time, state procurement for individual farms will be set at 50 percent of actual (rather than targeted) production for both cotton and grain. This will allow farmers to sell the remaining 50 percent of their crop as they wish, which will be vital in spurring both a domestic market for these products and the development of private cotton ginneries and grain processors. 28. The authorities also plan to enhance the role of the market in price formation and resource allocation during 2002. By June 30,2002, the number of monopolies and monopoly products are expected to be reduced by 25 percent and 16 percent, respectively, which will provide enterprises with greater freedom to set prices. In addition, the authorities have undertaken to eliminate by end-2002 the controls on trade margins for socially important goods that were introduced following the unification of the OTC and the official exchange rates on November 1. I8 Such restrictions include limiting formal access to cash by enterprises to amounts required to pay wages and meet travel expenses. Forcing all other transactions to be made by bank transfer facilitates the monitoring of enterprise financial operations by the tax authorities.

Financial Sector Vulnerability Uzbekistan has consistently pursued a strategy of supporting selected enterprises and sectors by providing government guarantees on domestic and foreign loans. In total, about three-quarters of the loans extended by commercial banks were guaranteed by the government at end-December 200 1. However, there has been some reduction in the share of new loans that has been extended with government guarantees (both for foreign currency and sum loans) over the past year. Commercial banks rely heavily on government guarantees to maintain capital adequacy ratios at acceptable levels. Official statistics (see below) indicate that nearly all commercial bank loans are rated as either of “good” or “standard” quality. Government-guaranteed loans are automatically classified as being of good quality. The shift in the proportion of loans classified as “good” to “standard” or lower during 2001 reflected the impact of the July and November devaluations on enterprise operations.

C. The Macroeconomic Framework 29. The authorities agreed that the external economic environment was likely to remain unfavorable in 2002. They were concerned that the expected further depreciation of the OTC exchange rate would have a contractionary impact on the economy. Nevertheless, they forecast real GDP growth of more than 5 percent for 2002. In the staffs view, this forecast is unrealistic. The slowdown in external demand, together with the probably short- term negative impact of the liberalization measures on some enterprises (that would only gradually be offset by the positive impact on export-oriented enterprises), would most likely result in lower growth in 2002 than the year before. According to staff estimates (which also take into account its alternative historical estimates), real GDP growth would not be much more than 2 percent in 2002. The staff agreed with the authorities that inflation would slow down sharply in 2002, if the foreign exchange and macroeconomic policies were implemented as envisaged. If these policies were to lead to a sharp appreciation of the curb market exchange rate, as expected by the staff, this would put strong downward pressure on most consumer prices. However, the staff doubted that the price increase would be 14 percent as forecast by the authorities. Rather, the staff forecast somewhat higher price increases of about 18 percent during 2002, or about one-third of the price increase recorded in 2001 according to the staffs alternative estimates. The authorities were not convinced of the staffs Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - arguments, but they agreed to use the staff estimates, rather than their own forecasts, as a basis for the macroeconomic framework underlying the SMP. The staff noted that if the authorities hesitated in the liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the curb market exchange rate may not appreciate enough to exert significant downward pressure on the inflation rate. In that case, inflation in 2002 could be significantly greater than projected by the staff. 30. The balance of payments is expected to deteriorate further in 2002. Following years of import compression implemented through the restrictive exchange rate regime, formal imports are likely to increase despite the expected depreciation of the OTC exchange rate. Also, informal imports (through shuttle trade) may increase as the curb market exchange rate is expected to appreciate.” Although some exports will benefit immediately from the depreciation of the OTC exchange rate, the main export commodities (cotton and gold) will be able to respond only over the somewhat longer term. Thus, the current account deficit is expected to deteriorate further to about 1 percent of GDP in 2002. The authorities will likely be able to cover most of this deficit, as well as debt repayments, through disbursements of already contracted loans and new disbursements.20 Nevertheless, gross international reserves are expected to decline by about US$135 million, and the reserve coverage of imports of goods and nonfactor services is expected to decline to 4 months from 4.7 months at the end of 2001. D. Medium-Term Framework 31. The authorities intend to continue the macroeconomic and structural reforms beyond mid-2002 and to seek support for their program from the international community, including through a financial arrangement with the IMF. The aim of the medium-term framework is to progressively dismantle existing restrictions and regulations- both formal and informal-to better allow economic agents to do business. This will enhance the efficiency of the public sector and permit the private sector to make a growing contribution to economic activitys21 l9 The indicative exchange rate is projected to appreciate by 25 percent in real terms during 2002 following a depreciation of 22 percent during 200 1 (Figure 5). 2o The disbursement of new loans includes the US$40 million identified as a financing gap in the budget. If the government fails to obtain such borrowing, it is assumed that the shortfall will be covered by nongovernment borrowing. 21 The specific measures that constitute the authorities’ medium-term program are set out in paragraphs 17-20 of the MEP in EBS/02/19.

The mission reviewed the medium term outlook on the assumption that the SMP will be implemented and that current account convertibility will be largely achieved by mid-2002. Although the initial response to the government’s program in terms of growth is likely to be modest, once confidence has been established, the benefits both in terms of a quickening pace of economic activity and a stronger balance of payments should become apparent. Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate in 2003 and reach about 5 percent by 2005. The improved business environment should result in a rapid increase in foreign direct investment, especially as privatization proceeds. Although the current account deficit is not projected to improve (partly because of imports associated with foreign direct investments), the structure of capital flows should progressively shift in favor of non-debt creating flows. As a result, the external debt service ratio is expected to fall from a high of 29 percent in 2001 to 15 percent in 2006 (Table 6). Similarly, the external debt ratio in relation to GDP is projected to peak at 58 percent in 2002 and decline to a more sustainable 48 percent in 2006. The authorities did not comment in detail on these scenarios, but they did not disagree with the main conclusions. They are aware of the vulnerability of Uzbekistan’s external position and intend to follow a cautious borrowing policy, in particular if economic growth were to fall short of projections. 33. The mission pointed out that the medium term outlook was subject to considerable uncertainties, especially downside risks from external factors. The Uzbek economy remains highly vulnerable to developments in international cotton and gold markets as well as to progress made in achieving political stability in the region. If cotton and/or gold prices were to decline, or if the recovery in the world economy were to be materially delayed, economic growth and the balance of payments would be affected adversely.22 Should such a situation emerge, the staff argued that it would be a mistake to revert to the types of policies pursued in recent years. Instead, it would be critical to continue the reform process and make the necessary policy adjustments within a market-oriented framework. E. Statistical Issuesz3 34. Uzbekistan’s macroeconomic statistics continue to suffer from major weaknesses. These weaknesses are related to problems with source data, the application of proper statistical methodologies, and political interference in the processing and dissemination of data. Little progress has been made so far in reconciling data issues between the staff and the authorities. In view of these uncertainties, agreement has not yet been reached on the introduction of a country page for Uzbekistan in the IFS. Understandings were reached with the authorities under the SMP that they will, before mid-year, implement IMF 22 If cotton prices were lower by 10 percent compared with the current assumptions, by 2006 the current account deficit would be about 1 percentage points of GDP larger than projected and the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to about 52% percent. 23 Statistical Issues are discussed in more detail in Appendix III.

Moreover, the authorities will, before May 2002, submit to Parliament a draft law on statistics, which will include a proposal to create an independent statistical agency. It is expected that this law will be passed before the end of the year. F. Other Issues 35. A number of external issues were also discussed. The authorities confirmed that there were no external payments arrears. They also explained that no progress has been made in the dispute with Russia concerning the settlement of technical credits extended by Russia to Uzbekistan during 1992-94, so the status of these obligations remains unresolved. The main change to the trade system in 2001 was the rationalization of the import tariff system in February.24 Trade liberalization in the period ahead will focus on a further streamlining and simplification of the import tariff system. Also, a gradual reduction in the number of goods subject to export bans is envisaged.25 With respect to nontariff barriers, the authorities intend to harmonize gradually the excise tax rates for domestically and imported goods. The reduction in nontariff barriers and the gradual reduction in the number of goods subject to export bans are expected to lead to increased interregional trade flows. Currently energy accounts for the majority of such flows. The authorities noted as well that they were actively pursuing Uzbekistan’s accession to the WTO. The preliminary stage of the discussions has been completed, all necessary documents have been prepared and exchanged with bilaterals, and all questions have been answered. However, due to delays associated with the Ministerial Meetings of the WTO in Doha, the negotiations will not start until spring 2002. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 36. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in February 200 1, Executive Directors urged the authorities to formulate an economic reform program that could form the basis for a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) and pave the way for financial support from the Fund in due course. The staff is pleased to note the major progress in this direction. There was a gradual, but substantial, shift in the authorities’ policy stance and level of cooperation with the Fund staff during 2001. Following the adoption of several foreign exchange reform measures at mid-year, the authorities in July/August elaborated, in cooperation with the Fund staff, a comprehensive economic program for the second half of 200 1. Their resolve to push 24As a result of these measures, the number of tariff bands (excluding those for cars) was reduced from 6 to 4, and the average unweighted import tariff rate was reduced from 26 percent to 19 percent. Nevertheless, the foreign trade regime remains very restrictive. It has a rating of “9” (down from “10” last year) on the Fund’s lo-point index of trade restrictiveness. 25 There are currently 14 items that are subject to export bans. Under the SMP, 3 items are scheduled to be removed from the list by June 2002. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-28 - ahead with reforms was strengthened following the events of September 11 and subsequent developments in the region. The authorities rightly recognized that the diminished terrorist threat and increased international focus on Central Asia presented a unique opportunity for Uzbekistan to speed up its reform efforts. Accordingly, the authorities were keen to deepen their cooperation with the Fund staff, and understandings were reached on a SMP covering the first half of 2002 during the Article IV consultation discussions in December 2001. The SMP is a modest step on the long road that Uzbekistan will have to travel to catch up with the more advanced transition economies. The staff urges the authorities to implement the program forcefully and consistently so that the SMP can pave the way for a much bolder reform effort that could be supported by financial assistance from the Fund and from other international financial institutions and bilateral creditors. 37. The success of the SMP, and the progress of market reforms themselves, will require above all more even and consistent policy implementation than in the past. In particular, the authorities must adhere to the spirit of the program, as well as the letter, and avoid discrepancies between the formal rules and regulations and how they are implemented in the economy. In this connection, the staff welcomes the authorities’ stated commitment to transparency in economic policies, including their authorization to the IMF to publish the SMP documents and their publication in the mass media in Uzbekistan. The authorities have also expressed their intention to agree to the issuance of a PIN and the publication of the staff report following the conclusion of the 200 1 Article IV consultation. 38. The centerpiece of the government’s program is the progressive liberalization of the foreign exchange regime aimed at achieving near current account convertibility by the middle of 2002, and the acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement in the context of a financial arrangement with the Fund that they hope to obtain subsequently. The changes made to the foreign exchange regulations during 200 1, and those envisaged for the first half of 2002, are steps in the right direction. However, inadequate implementation of the new regulations, informal restrictions, and other rigidities appear to continue to hamper access to foreign exchange, as evidenced by the large spread between the official exchange rates and the curb market rate that persisted through January 2002. The authorities need to address such problems urgently. Current account convertibility will be achieved only when there is full and genuine access to foreign exchange for all current account transactions, all official exchange rates have been unified, and the spread between this rate and the curb market rate has become negligible. The authorities rightly plan to follow a floating exchange rate regime once current account convertibility has been achieved. 39. The authorities are aware that these foreign exchange rate measures will need to be supported by appropriately tight macroeconomic policies and structural reform measures in other areas to avoid, among other things, sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate. The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to maintain a prudent fiscal stance in 2002, including making transparent within the budget all financial assistance provided to enterprises under strain from the reform process. It will be crucial, however, that the assistance to enterprises be kept within the established limits and temporary. Appropriate allowance has also been Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - made for the protection of vulnerable groups as the implicit subsidies provided through the multiple exchange rate system are gradually removed. Wage restraint, however, will be essential to achieving the fiscal targets, and will help moderate inflation expectations. Finally, the authorities must honor their commitment to take revenue-raising and expenditure- reducing measures if the current budgetary financing gap is not covered by foreign financing. 40. Tight monetary policy will be vital to avoid sharp fluctuations of exchange rates as access to foreign exchange is liberalized. The staff welcomes the plans to transfer the management of all international reserves to the CBU, which should facilitate the conduct of monetary policy. With respect to interest rate policy, the staff urges the CBU to keep the recently raised refinance rate under constant review to ensure that it is positive in real terms. The CBU will also need to play a key role in easing both formal and informal operating restrictions on commercial banks and allowing them to evolve as effective financial intermediaries. A swift transition from the system of directed credits to genuinely competitive credit auctions and the removal of restrictions on cash operations will be key elements in this process. In such an environment, the CBU will need to develop and use more market-oriented policy instruments, including making greater use of open-market operations. The staff welcomes the plans to improve the transparency of the operations of the CBU. The planned international audit of its 2001 balance sheet will only be the first step and should be followed immediately by a safeguard assessment. 41. Given the macroeconomic importance of the agricultural sector in Uzbekistan, the prevalence of poverty in rural areas, and the importance of generating an early supply response from farmers to the foreign exchange liberalization measures, early reform of the sector is a key priority. The staff welcomes the measures taken to increase procurement prices and expand opportunities for farmers to sell freely a portion of their crop. The staff urges the authorities to implement these measures forcefully and ensure that all farmers are adequately informed of the new regulations to enable them to take maximum advantage of these new opportunities. 42. The staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to streamline anti-monopoly legislation and refocus it from a system of widespread controls over prices to a mechanism aimed at avoiding the accrual of excessive rents to natural monopolies. The staff urges the government to ensure that these measures are implemented down to the level of municipalities, where local governments on occasion excessively interfere in enterprise operations. 43. The planned trade liberalization measures-including streamlining the tariff schedule, facilitating clearance of import contracts, and gradual removal of export bans-will be vital in the transformation of the Uzbek economy from its current inward looking orientation to one that will increasingly share in the benefits of world trade. The staff urges the authorities not to resist the significant changes in relative prices that are likely to occur as the multiple exchange rate system is dismantled and trade reform proceeds. This will necessarily force some enterprises that hitherto owed their viability to prevailing distortions to either restructure and redefine themselves or be liquidated.

It should be strongly emphasized that the wide divergences with respect to national accounts and consumer price data between official statistics and alternative staff indicators will need to be narrowed significantly before a financial arrangement with the Fund can be contemplated. Such differences complicate a meaningful analysis of economic developments and are a major distraction in the conduct of a serious policy dialogue, as clearly demonstrated in the context of the discussions of the macroeconomic framework for the SMP. The staff welcomes the authorities’ plans to introduce a new law on statistics, including the proposal to establish an independent statistical agency. However, this law will not become effective until the end of the year. It is crucial that political interference in the processing and dissemination of statistics cease and improvements in macroeconomic indicators be made well before then. 45. Uzbekistan maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4, as described in Box 1 above. In the absence of a clear timetable for their removal, the staff does not recommend their approval and would urge their speedy elimination. 46. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12- month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- Table 1.

Exchange rate arrangements The national currency, the sum, was introduced on July 1, 1994 to replace the transitional sum coupon issued in late-1993. The conversion rate was 1,000 sum coupons to 1 sum and the initial auction-based official exchange rate was sum 6.94 per U.S. dollar. Through 1996, the official exchange rate was the auction exchange rate as determined by auctions of U.S. dollars held twice a week (daily since March 1997). Effective January 1, 1997, a system of multiple exchange rates was formally introduced. The official exchange rate was set as the weighted average of the U.S. dollar auction rates from the previous week plus a discretionary adjustment; in practice, this exchange rate deviated only slightly from the auction rate. Official exchange rates for 30 other currencies and the SDR are established through U.S. dollar cross rates and are applied to official transactions and used as accounting rates by the central bank. Until June 30, 1998, the central bank formally limited the margin at which foreign exchange bought at the official exchange rate could be sold on the official commercial bank and cash markets to a maximum of 12 percent. Effective July 1, 1998 the commercial bank exchange rate was officially delinked from the official rate and the spread allowed to increase. On January 1, 1999, a 5 percent tax on foreign exchange purchases at the commercial bank market was introduced. On May 1,2000, the official exchange rate was unified with the commercial bank exchange rate at the commercial bank rate level. On July 1,2000, two new exchange rates were introduced: (i) a new commercial bank exchange rate applicable to imports of consumer goods for license holders and the non-surrendered part of the receipts from non-centralized exports; (ii) a cash foreign exchange bureau rate applicable to cash foreign exchange transactions conducted at the authorized foreign exchange bureaus. These two new exchange rates were initially set at the same level and close to the then prevailing curb market exchange rate. After November 2000, the cash foreign exchange bureau rate was allowed to become systematically more devalued than the commercial bank exchange rate. On July 1,200 1, several important changes were made to the foreign exchange system: (1) the commercial bank rate was replaced by a free-floating over-the-counter (OTC) rate determined by supply and demand at interbank auctions held several times in a week; (2) the surrender requirement for small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) exporting their own products was abolished; (3) all transactions except the mandatory surrender of proceeds from centralized exports and debt service on government and government guaranteed foreign exchange loans contracted before July 1,200l were transferred from the official market to the OTC market; (4) the 5 percent tax on foreign exchange purchases was effectively abolished (later this tax was formally abolished by a joint Decree by the Ministry of Finance and Customs Committee); (5) a “Consolidated Stabilization Fund” was established, with the purpose of reducing the short-term volatility of the exchange rate until the market is fully liberalized. Effective August 1, 2001, the system of licenses and quotas for imports of consumer goods was abolished, but quarterly limits are set for the allocation of foreign exchange for “socially significant” consumer goods and medical supplies. The administration of applications for foreign exchange has been transferred from the Republican Monetary Committee to commercial Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - APPENDIX I banks. A negative list of 61 goods for which allocation of foreign exchange is “not recommended” remained in place as of December 3 1,200 1. Effective November 1,200 1, the official market rate was abolished and servicing of all credits in foreign currency was shifted to the OTC market rate. A new official exchange rate was established once a week, based on the average OTC rates of the previous week and on other parameters. It is used mainly for statistical and reporting purposes and for the calculation of customs payments, but some transactions (mainly the obligatory surrender requirements for centralized exports) are effected at this rate. Although exchange rates at both the OTC market and (cash) foreign exchange bureaus, according to the foreign exchange regulations, are determined by market forces, persistent high spreads between these rates and the curb market exchange rate suggest administrative interference by the authorities in the OTC and cash foreign exchange markets. At end-December 2001, the spread between the official/OTC and cash curb market rates was 117 percent while the spread between the cash foreign exchange bureau and curb market rates was 68 percent. The following exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII were identified during the 2001 Article IV consultation: (i) a restriction arising from foreign exchange rationing implemented through the identification of low priority goods (the “non-recommended” list), not eligible to receive foreign exchange from the official/OTC market and the identification of eligible goods and importers and assignment of foreign exchange quotas for non-consumer goods; (ii) a multiple currency practice arising from the segmentation of the official exchange market, resulting in large deviations in the cash foreign exchange market vis-a-vis the OTC rate; (iii) a restriction arising from the prohibition of the purchase of foreign exchange by enterprises that hold balances of foreign currency on their accounts that are free of liabilities; (iv) a restriction on the making of advance payments to certain specified offshore territories and on the making of payments under contract for works (services) to such offshore territories; (v) a restriction on the making of payments to non-residents that are not party to import contracts; (vi) a restriction arising from the requirement that importers that wish to purchase foreign exchange to make an advance payment under an import contract must make an advance sum deposit in the amount of 100 percent of the advance payment, which is released only after the importer presents to the bank a certified original of the document confirming that the goods have actually been imported; (vii) a restriction arising from the imposition of a ceiling on the amount of interest and other payments provided for in loan contracts with non-residents that can be paid in the fulfillment of such legally valid loan contracts (a maximum of 20 percent per annum of principal outstanding); (viii) a restriction on the amount of foreign exchange which residents may purchase for the purpose of making invisible payments; and (ix) a restriction limiting the amount of foreign exchange which can be purchased by nonresident individuals to the amounts earlier exchanged for sums.

Technical assistance Technical assistance and training have been provided by the Fund (MAE, FAD, STA, LEG, INS) to Uzbekistan in a number of areas. Bilateral donors and other international agencies, including the World Bank, the European Union, and the OECD, also have provided considerable technical assistance. Technical experts from a number of countries have accompanied Fund staff on technical assistance missions. The Fund intensified its program of technical assistance to Uzbekistan in 1994-97. However, in the past four years fewer requests for technical assistance have been received by the authorities. Additional technical assistance is needed in many areas, and follow-up technical assistance is envisaged on national accounts and price statistics, money and banking statistics and balance of payments statistics.

Courses on selected topics were also organized in Tashkent in June 1993, May 1994, and April/May 1998. 11. Resident representative The Fund’s first Resident Representative, Mr. Istvan Szalkai, was in Tashkent from September 1993 to September 1995. His successor as Resident Representative, Mr. Mark O’Brien, served from November 1995 to December 1997. He was replaced by Mr. Christoph Rosenberg who served from January 1998 to April 200 1. Currently, the Fund does not have a resident representative in Uzbekistan, but maintains a locally staffed office in Tashkent. 12. Resident advisors Mr. Richard Grzebinski served as advisor on computerization to the State Tax Committee from January 1994 to January 1995. His successor, Mr. Emmanuel Sigler, served from April to June 1995. Mr. Alexander Agafonoff served as an advisor on monetary policy at the Central Bank of Uzbekistan from November 1994 to December 1995. Mr. Jim Stevenson began his service as an advisor on treasury operations at the Ministry of Finance in September 1996. His assignment was prematurely terminated in July 1998 because of a lack of cooperation by the Ministry of Finance.

Uzbekistan became a member of the IBRD and the IDA in September 1992, of the IFC in October 1993 and of the MIGA in November 1993. 2. The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covering FY98-01, discussed by the Bank’s Executive Directors in March 1998, proposed an intermediate or base case lending scenario totaling up to US$300-350 million and was designed to create incentives for deeper structural reforms through selected investment and technical assistance operations, in parallel with continuing policy dialogue. Implementation, however, fell short of expectations due to delays in project preparation, including outstanding government actions, and only five loans totaling US$136 million (excluding a US$75 million loan for Water Supply, Sanitation and Health included in the previous CAS) were approved during FY 1998-2000. A new CAS covering FY2002-2004 is currently under preparation and is expected to be presented to the Bank’s Board in March 2002. Starting with the new CAS, Uzbekistan will be accessing both IBRD and IDA resources. An IDA Eligibility Paper was transmitted to the Bank’s Executive Directors in December 200 1. 3. As of January 3 1,2002, eleven Bank loans had been committed, namely: Institution Building Technical Assistance (US$21 million, approved October 1993, full disbursed and closed in October 2000); Rehabilitation (US$l60 million, approved March 1995, fully disbursed and closed in June 1996, but performance rated unsatisfactory); Cotton Subsector Improvement (US$66 million, approved May 1995); Pilot Water Supply’ (US$5 million, approved September 1996); Water Supply, Sanitation and Health (US$75 million, approved August 1997); Tashkent Solid Waste (US$24 million, approved May 1998); Enterprise Institution Building (US$28 million, approved June 1998); Health (US$30 million, approved September 1998); Financial Institution Building (US$25,million, approved May 1999); Urban Transport (US$29 million, approved May 2000); and Rural Enterprise Support (US$36 million, approved December 2001 but not yet signed or effective). 4. The undisbursed balance of seven effective ongoing loans was US$177 million as of December 3 1,200l. Preparation of proposed loans for the Bukhara & Samarkand Water Supply, Karshi Pumping Station Rehabilitation, Public Finance Management Technical Assistance, and Drainage Projects is currently underway. 5. The Bank’s nonlending activities have taken the form of a Country Economic Memorandum (1993) and thematic economic and sector work focusing on subsidies and ’ Subsequently subsumed and refinanced under the US$75 million Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Health loan approved in August 1997.

In addition, the Bank has approved Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grants for external resources management (1992), public procurement (1996), securities market development (1996), economic statistics (1998), pension reform (1998, together with a related ADB technical assistance grant), training in economic policy analysis (1999), anti-monopoly and competition policies (2000), and environmental management (2000). Finally, a Living Standards/Poverty Assessment is currently underway (for completion by mid-CY2002), an Economic Report is planned for later in CY2002, and an Energy Sector Review is scheduled for CY2003. 6. The International Finance Corporation has focused its activities in Uzbekistan on developing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and strengthening financial markets. SMEs have received financial assistance via credit lines through local financial intermediaries and direct investment on a selective basis. Four SME credit line facilities have been approved, including two with small private regional banks. Technical assistance for pre- and post-investment support is being provided to SME borrowers. Other approved IFC investments are in the pharmaceutical industry, furniture manufacturing, granite processing, and cheese production. 7. In the financial sector, emphasis has been placed on the creation of a strong and competitive private banking sector. IFC has approved an equity investment in ABN-AMRO Bank Uzbekistan and a technical assistance component to two local banks to assist them in becoming more efficient and prudent financial intermediaries. Leasing activities have been a priority with assistance given to draft the law on leasing and IFC investments in two joint- venture leasing companies. A regional early stage equity investment fund is being developed by IFC and SEAF, a leading manager of small equity funds.

Progress achieved in early 2001 in the development of a draft country page for Uzbekistan for publication in International Financial Statistics (rFs) has stalled. On March 21,2001, the Statistics Department transmitted to the Uzbek authorities the draft IFS page containing the then most current data provided and the accompanying notes for the authorities’ review and approval. However, to date, no response from the authorities has been received. The authorities should be encouraged to follow up on this work. 2. A number of deficiencies were identified by a STA mission that visited in February 1998. These include an overestimation of real GDP growth rates in past years due to a number of factors, including (i) the inconsistent treatment of informal sector activities over time; (ii) inappropriate procedures for dealing with the increased share of high value commodities with low trade margins in organized retail turnover;’ and (iii) the use of the downward biased consumer price index as a deflator for trade activities and subsidies. While the staff has made an independent estimate for results from 1997 to 2001, the data base is insufficient to prepare estimates for the preceding years. Serious problems also persist at the level of source data, which continue to be collected and processed following statistical methodologies of the former centrally planned economy. 3. Another STA mission identified a significant downward bias in the consumer price index owing to an incorrect methodological treatment of prices of all goods that are temporarily unavailable, including seasonal products. In 1997, this resulted in a major difference between official and Fund staff estimates for food price increases in the capital, Tashkent, although both sets of calculations were based on identical source data supplied by the authorities. STA has recommended that the authorities recalculate the consumer price index from January 1997 using the correct methodology. The authorities appear to have started using an improved CPI methodology effective May 1998, but have resisted recalculating past inflation data. Since January 1999, however, differences between the official estimates of food price increases and those prepared by Fund staff have increased dramatically. 4. Further deficiencies have been identified in the methodology used to compute sectoral deflators, and no price indices for imports, exports, and investment exist. Although i The Uzbek statistical authorities estimate output of retail trade in constant prices by using a volume index for total retail turnover rather than disaggregated retail turnover volume indices. This method does not take account of changes in the commodity structure of trade. As the share of high-value commodities with low trade margins (automobiles) increases, it results in an overstatement of growth in retail trade. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 46 - APPENDIX III the authorities have made substantial progress in constructing a producer price index, the enterprise and product coverage should be expanded. 5. Regarding data on external trade, exports of cotton and other bulk exports are valued on a c.i.f. basis rather than f.o.b., and data are not adjusted to capture informal cross-border trade and shuttle trade. Also, two parallel systems-based on customs declarations and on enterprise surveys-exist for compiling trade data. STA has recommended that the customs data be used for compiling merchandise trade statistics and that the enterprise reports be continued for collecting data on trade in services only. Government finance 6. Detailed data on revenues and expenditures of the state budget and the extrabudgetary funds are compiled by the Ministry of Finance monthly, and they are available after a processing time of about three weeks. Between missions, however, it is difficult to obtain these detailed figures. Only broad categories for revenue and expenditures of the state budget and the balance of major extrabudgetary funds are provided on a routine basis. 7. When available, detailed data on the components of state-budget expenditure are organized according to the largely functional classification. An economic classification of expenditure data is available only annually, and the quality of these data is inadequate. Detailed data on revenue and expenditure of the state budget and the extrabudgetary funds often include items that should be classified as financing (e.g., credit repayments). The Ministry of Finance has started to provide occasionally data on tax and expenditure arrears. The authorities have also started to provide information on total proceeds from privatization operations. The authorities have requested technical assistance from the Fund for an expenditure review, but FAD has postponed indefinitely such a mission because of a lack of data provision and receptiveness to Fund advice. FAD has withdrawn prematurely a resident advisor who was to help in the establishment of a Treasury at the Ministry of Finance because of a lack of support by the authorities for his work. One of the benefits of the Treasury would have been an improvement in the compilation of government finance statistics. 8. Uzbekistan does not yet report the government finance statistics to the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA). As a result, a country page in the International Finance Statistics (IFS) or Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) could not be prepared. Money and banking 9. In March 1997, the authorities introduced a new chart of accounts for the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) and commercial banks. A money and banking statistics mission in March-April 1997 assisted the CBU in developing procedures for compiling monetary statistics based on the new charts of accounts and in improving the account classifications in the old chart of accounts for use in revising historical data. The STA mission in April/May 1998 provided further assistance to the CBU in recommending improvements in the procedures for compiling monetary statistics. Two follow-up STA missions in November Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 47 - APPENDIX III 1998 and April/May 2000, respectively, made progress in resolving issues linked to the preparation of monetary and financial statistics for eventual inclusion in a proposed Uzbekistan page in IFS. Balance of payments 10. Uzbekistan does not report any balance of payments data to STA. A STA mission that visited in March 2000, as a follow-up to the February 1998 mission, reported that the authorities have made considerable progress in the compilation of balance of payments statistics. Progress was noted in the compilation of data on the financial account and external debt. Additionally, there was an increased interest and cooperation on the part of all institutions to work jointly to improve the compilation of the balance of payments. Specific improvements were made in accordance with the recommendations of the February 1998 mission. These include the preparation of balance of payments data on a quarterly basis in U.S. dollars (the classification of which conforms closely with the recommendations of the IMF Balance ofPayments Manual (BPA4.5) and the inclusion of adjustments for shuttle trade in the recorded international trade data, estimates for migrant transfers, and other adjustments to the exports and imports data. Despite these improvements, some problems remain with respect to understating the values of travel credits and construction services, and the unavailability of enterprise data on direct portfolio and other investment.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2001 Article IV Consultation with Uzbekistan On March [8], 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Uzbekistan.’ Background Since Uzbekistan became independent in 1991, its economy has been state-dominated and heavily dependent on cotton production. The first tentative steps at creating a market economy were taken in 1994, but the process unraveled in 1996 following a poor cotton harvest. Most economic activity continues to be subject to extensive restrictions and controls, including through a complex and burdensome multiple exchange rate system. The result has been stagnant growth, high inflation, and stalled development of the private sector. However, this is not immediately apparent from official statistics, which have consistently portrayed healthy growth and high, but stable inflation, Technical and other deficiencies in these statistics prompted the IMF staff to calculate alternative indicators that are believed to give a better picture of economic developments. According to official data, real GDP grew by 4.5 percent in 2001, driven mainly by rapid growth in retail trade and in new small industries. The 2001 cotton harvest also showed improvement relative to 2000. Official data showed consumer price inflation in 2001 at 26 percent. However, alternative staff estimates suggest that real GDP growth in 2001 was about 3 l/2 percent, while ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the March [8], 2002 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5l- APPENDIX V the alternative indicator for consumer price inflation rose by 54 percent. The large wage increases granted by the government (40 percent in 2001) have been a major contributor to the persistently high inflation rate in recent years. The external current account, which recorded a modest surplus in 2000, swung into deficit in 2001 (about W percent of GDP) as a sharp decline in cotton prices hurt export performance. The authorities responded by compressing the import of consumer goods and other non- strategic items, mainly by limiting access to foreign exchange. Net drawdowns on public and publicly guaranteed debt were insufficient to prevent a small overall balance of payments deficit from emerging. Gross international reserves declined modestly (to 4.7 months of imports of goods and non-factor services at end-2001). Outstanding external debt continued to climb in 2001 (to 41 percent of GDP), but due to lower world interest rates, debt service payments in 2001 were unchanged relative to 2000 at 29 percent of exports of goods and non- factor services. The authorities made significant modifications to the multiple exchange rate system in 2001. Nonetheless, the regime continues to be very restrictive, as reflected in the large spread between the official exchange rates and the curb market exchange rates. On July 1, the authorities shifted to the over-the-counter (OTC) exchange rate purchases of capital equipment and other inputs and conversions associated with the surrender of proceeds of non- strategic exports (which had hitherto taken place at the more appreciated official exchange rate). Following this step, transactions at the official rate were limited to debt service payments and the surrender of proceeds from centralized exports. On November 1, the official and OTC exchange rates were unified. The operation of the OTC market was also modified at mid-year when an auction mechanism was established for matching supply and demand for foreign exchange, However, in practice, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan influences the OTC exchange rate both by regulating access to the auctions and through direct intervention. On December 31, 2001, the following were the key prevailing exchange rates (with the actual rates indicated in parenthesis): the OTC exchange rate for most formal transactions (sum 688/US$), the cash bureau exchange rate for individual travel (sum 9OO/US$), and the curb market exchange rate for unofficial operations (sum 1,49O/US$). Fiscal policy through most of 2000 and 2001 was relatively tight due to the government’s limited scope for non-inflationary deficit financing. Weak revenue performance in both years necessitated a compression of expenditures which fell mainly on centralized investments and to some extent socio-cultural expenditures. Fiscal policy was loosened toward the end of 2001 due to the large wage increase granted in August and, later in the year, assistance provided to enterprises hard-hit by the 2001 exchange rate reforms. Monetary policy was kept tight in the first half of 2001 to create favorable conditions for the foreign exchange regime reforms. However, following the July 1 measures, many enterprises experienced liquidity pressures and the authorities responded by easing access to credit. This led to an acceleration in the growth of monetary aggregates toward the end of 2001. Although the commercial banking system appears strong judging by banks’ prudential ratios, the preponderance of government- guaranteed loans in their portfolios (about 75 percent of total loans) makes an accurate assessment difficult.

Both products remain subject to the state order system with the state dictating both prices and cropping patterns. Low procurement prices for cotton and grain have been the main mechanism used to transfer resources from agriculture to the rest of the economy. The government announced an ambitious program of privatization in 1998 and followed up in 2000 and 2001 with legislation targeting communications, energy, and financial sectors for early sale. However, interest on the part of both domestic and foreign investors has been negligible as the general economic environment remains too restrictive and non-transparent, and also because in most cases only minority stakes have been offered for sale. Prompted mainly by a perceived easing of the threat to internal security following the change of regime in Afghanistan, the Uzbek government in late 2001 initiated a program of economic reform. The aim of the program is to reorient decisively the economy along market lines and at the same time to bring inflation under control and create the conditions for rapid and sustainable growth. The program for the first half of 2002 is monitored by IMF staff under a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP), which was published on the IMF website on February 7, 2002 (www.imf.org). The main goals of the government’s program are the maintenance of tight macroeconomic policies in support of the gradual liberalization of the exchange rate regime and reform of the state order system. The ultimate objective is to create conditions that will permit the introduction of full current account convertibility later in 2002.
