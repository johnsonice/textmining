Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Teheran during June 24-July 11, 1995. The mission held discussions with Dr. Nourbakhsh, Governor of the Bank Markazi Jomhouri Islami Iran (the central bank), and senior officials of the central bank, ministries, and agencies. The authorities emphasized the importance they attached to the Article IV consultation process and to the technical assistance Iran has received from the Fund over the years. 1/ In concluding the last Article IV consultation on October 20, 1993, Directors commended the Iranian authorities for their program of reconstruction and economic liberalization, including the exchange rate unification of March 1993 and the simultaneous freeing of external current account transactions. However, Directors expressed concern over the intensification of macroeconomic imbalances and the emergence of large external payments arrears. They urged the authorities to implement a comprehensive adjustment effort and to seek an early normalization of relations with foreign creditors. Particular emphasis was placed on the need to bring domestic energy prices closer to world market levels, replace consumer subsidies by a well-targeted social safety net, increase the rates of return on financial assets, and improve the financial discipline of state enterprises. The delay in holding the Article IV consultation was due to scheduling difficulties, partly because the authorities were engaged in debt rescheduling negotiations and preparing the Second Five Year Development Plan during 1994/95 which the staff wanted to cover in the discussions. A staff team visited Teheran in January 1995 to update information and prepare for the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions. Iran maintains a multiple currency practice in the form of a dual official exchange rate. It also has exchange restrictions as evidenced by external payment arrears, an advance import deposit requirement with nonpayment of interest on the deposits, an allowance for foreign travel, and inoperative bilateral payment agreements with Fund members which have balances in the trading partners' favor, that are subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. u The coverage and quality of the data provided to the mission permitted it to make a satisfactory assessment of economic developments and to form a perspective on the economy's medium-term prospects. The mission urged the u The mission also met with representatives from the financial, business, and academic communities. The staff team consisted of Messrs.

II. Background and Recent Developments 1. The First Five-Year Development Plan (1989/90-1993/94) 3J After the war with Iraq (1980-88), Iran embarked on a major program of reconstruction and economic reform in the First Five-Year Development Plan (FFYDP). Policies included decontrolling most domestic prices, raising public utility rates, removing many nontariff trade barriers, lowering income tax rates, eliminating bank credit ceilings, starting to privatize public enterprises, and liberalizing the exchange system. These led to a number of important achievements. The growth rate of real GDP averaged 7 percent over the period, which compared favorably with those of other fuel exporting developing countries. At the same time, agricultural production increased and became more diversified, non-oil exports grew at a compound annual rate of 26 percent, and social indicators improved markedly. Progress under the FFYDP was hampered, however, by overly expansionary financial policies and the resulting macroeconomic imbalances. Driven by rapid credit expansion to the public enterprises and the private sector, monetary growth was in the range of 20-25 percent per annum during 1990/91-1992/93. The estimates of real aggregate demand indicate that it grew more rapidly than output (Table 1 and Chart 1). These imbalances, combined with administered price adjustments, led to inflation of about 20-25 percent per annum. The associated overvaluation of the official exchange rates and the reconstruction effort contributed to a surge of imports in 1991/92 and 1992/93. This, combined with lower oil exports, resulted in a pronounced weakening in the current account to an average deficit of almost US$9 billion in 1991/92-1992/93, compared with a deficit of less than US$l billion in 1990/91. With limited access to longer-term external financing, the current account deficit was reflected in a reduction of external reserves and the incurrence of a large amount of short-term lJ Statistical issues are discussed in Section III and Appendix V. 2/ Relations with the World Bank Group are described in Appendix IV. 3J Iranian years beginning March 21.

In 1993/94, the capital account of the balance of payments shifted to a deficit of USS4.5 billion (compared with a surplus of USS3.7 billion in 1992/93). As a result, the overall deficit in the balance of payments rose sharply and, given the low level of reserves, it was financed by a sizable further accumulation of external arrears which totaled USS11.2 billion by the end of 1993/94. A key objective of the FFYDP was the unification of the official exchange rates at a market-related level. In March 1993, an official floating rate was introduced at about Rls 1,600 per US$l, compared with a prevailing weighted average exchange rate of Rls 515 per US$l. IJ However, foreign exchange continued to be provided (for essential imports and repayments of short-term foreign debt contracted prior to the unification) at the previous, more appreciated rates. This gave rise to sizable auasi-fiscal foreign exchange losses in 1993/94, largely reversing the sharp improvement in the budgetary position that had been achieved theretofore. Thus, the fiscal deficit (including.foreign exchange losses) rose to 6.3 percent of GDP in 1993/94 and the accompanying rapid growth of broad money contributed to an acceleration of inflation to 38 percent (Tables 2 and 3; and Chart 2). The official exchange rate ceased to float in December 1993 when it was effectively fixed at Rls 1,750 per US$l. 2J When this exchange rate level came under increasing pressure, administrative allocation of foreign exchange at the official rate was reintroduced and the free market rate depreciated sharply. In an effort to reduce these pressures, the authorities reduced the limit on the amount of foreign exchange for travel purposes. Until 1992/93, the real effective exchange rate depreciated moderately; in 1993/94, as a result of the above developments, both the real and the nominal effective exchange rates (based on a weighted average which includes the free market exchange rate) depreciated markedly (by 36 percent and 44 percent, respectively), which continued in 1994/95 (29 percent and 44 percent, respectively; Chart 3). I/ Before March 1993, the official rates were Rls 70 per US$l (mainly for oil exports, essential imports, and government debt service) and Rls 600 per US$l (for nonessential imports and related services). There was also the free market rate (for non-oil exports and most service transactions). 2J Nevertheless, this effectively fixed rate continues to be referred to in Iran as the official "floating" rate.

Developments in 1994/95 and first quarter of 1995/96 In 1994/95, the authorities' overriding objective was to normalize Iran's relations with its foreign creditors, while their economic policies aimed at reducing the macroeconomic imbalances. To this end, the policy stance comprised a reduction in the fiscal deficit and a deceleration in the growth of credit to the private sector. This was to be supported by the negotiation of refinancing agreements bilaterally with creditors in the context of timely settlement of current maturities and strengthening of the external reserves position. The authorities achieved a measure of progress in reducing financial imbalances. The overall fiscal deficit was reduced to 4.8 percent of GDP as quasi-fiscal foreign exchange losses were contained. In addition, the growth of net domestic credit slowed, although this was partly offset by an increase in net foreign assets; monetarv prowth tapered off to 29 percent (compared with 35 percent in 1993/94). However, inflation remained high (at 36 percent) as the demand for rial-denominated assets was weakened by increasingly negative real rates of return and (as discussed below) the growth rate of real GDP declined and exchange rate developments put upward pressure on costs and prices. The authorities' immediate external objectives were largely achieved. First, they succeeded in refinancing most of the overdue external payments through bilateral channels, thereby reducing the stock of external arrears to USS3.3 billion (from USS11.2 billion at end-1993/94). I/ As a result of the refinancing operations, short-term debt outstanding was reduced by US$lO.9 billion to USS6.4 billion while the medium- and long-term debt rose to USS16.0 billion (including USS11.5 billion of refinanced debt). Currently, the authorities are negotiating to clear remaining arrears. Second, the external debt obligations falling due in 1994/95 (except letters of credit opened before 1994/95) were met as planned and gross official reserves rose by USS1.3 billion (to USs4.2 billion, equivalent to 3.6 months of imports). However, because of the continued weakness of international oil prices and the lack of fresh external financing, the timely debt service and the increase in reserves required a one-third contraction in imports (to half their level in 1991/92), which contributed to markedly slower growth in non-oil output. As a result, the current account of the balance of payments shifted into a surplus of USS4.5 billion (Table 4 and Chart 4).

To alleviate the foreign exchange constraint, the authorities reverted to a dual official exchange system and introduced, in May 1994, a more depreciated official rate (the "export rate") at Rls 2,345 per US$l, applicable to non-oil exports and nonessential imports. u In January 1995, a 50 percent repatriation and surrender requirement was imposed on non-oil exports. Iran experienced heightened macroeconomic instability in the first quarter of 1995/96. During this period, the authorities continued to conduct fiscal operations and to manage credit policy with a view to reducing monetary growth. However, they also continued to take only very limited action on interest rates so that the structure of deposit and lending rates remained strongly negative. The announcement by the United States of intensified and extended sanctions had a pronounced negative impact on expectations. These factors triggered a run on the foreign exchange market and buying in the goods market. The free market exchane rate shot to Rls 6,200 per US$l, and May-on-May inflation in consumer prices to 59 percent (from 34 percent in December 1994). The authorities responded by raising the export repatriation and surrender requirement to 100 percent; ending the free nonbank market by requiring all foreign exchange transactions to be effected through the banking system; and depreciating the official export rate from Rls 2,345 to Rls 3,000 per US$l (Table 5). u Pressures on the exchange rate appear to have abated since. III. Policy Discussions The authorities emphasized strongly that their highest priority was to effect debt service on schedule. They also attached importance to reducing inflation and further strengthening Bank Markazi's external reserves so as to decrease the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks. For the medium term, the Second Five-Year DeveloDment Plan (SFYDP), whose implementation has begun in 1995/96, calls for reducing inflation to an average annual rate of 12 percent while achieving an average annual growth rate of 5 percent. It also incorporates a resumption of reforms initiated during the FFYDP, including more realistic domestic petroleum prices and a unification of the official exchange rates. v I-J However, the bulk of non-oil export revenue continued to be kept abroad, to be used directly by the exporters, or to be sold in the nonbank free market for foreign exchange. 2/ Following the May modification in the exchange system, the legal free market has been supplanted by a parallel market whose demand side reflects, mainly, the existence of restrictions on travel allowances and capital outflows. y Further information on the SFYDP is in Appendix I of the report on Recent Economic Developments.

They expected that the fiscal operations would achieve near balance, as budgeted in 1995/96, and that this would enable them to reduce monetary growth to around 20 percent. This would be consistent with maintaining the official export exchange rate at its present level for a reasonable period. The more appreciated official exchange rate would be phased out during the SFYDP. Domestic price distortions--notably the still very high implicit energy subsidy--would be reduced during the SFYDP. The thrust of the policy message conveyed by the mission was that Iran would realize better growth and inflation performance from a more ambitious stabilization and structural reform package given the extent of the macroeconomic imbalances, distortions in resource allocation, and the external environment. The mission expressed concerns regarding the downside risks in the budgetary outlook and, especially in the event that slippages materialized, regarding the ability of the central bank to contain monetary expansion at the targeted rate. The mission also expressed concern as to the sustainability and competitiveness of the level of the export exchange rate and drew attention to the sensitivity of the balance of payments to volatile oil exports. The policy package recommended by the mission includes a substantial increase in rates of return on deposits and in the rates of charge on the flow of new credit to bring them to positive real levels, and exchange rate unification by the start of 1996/97 with market-related management of rates before and after unification. To compensate for some of the impact of these measures on consumers and producers, a unified and well-targeted social safety net lJ would be operated within the budget (as advised in FAD technical assistance), concurrently with limited and time-bound budget transfers to certain public and quasi-public enterprises pending their restructuring and corporatization. The mission stressed that budgetary expenditures arising from these measures would need to be more than offset by a large initial increase in domestic petroleum product prices. This would be followed by phased increases in oil product prices to international levels within the SF'YDP period. 1. Fiscal uolicv The budget for 1995/96 projects revenue growth of 0.4 percentage points of GDP and expenditure reduction of 4.4 percentage points of GDP, with the net outcome being a small deficit of 0.1 percent of GDP. The budget I/ The current social safety net comprises a coupon system for essential goods, cash transfers to the poor, implicit price subsidies (e.g., oil product prices and the official exchange rate), and a variety of welfare services. In addition to the Government itself, the welfare services and cash transfers are provided by a number of public agencies and the quasi-public Islamic foundations (bonyads). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - introduced an excise tax on the consumption of petroleum products, which had the effect of doubling domestic petroleum nrices, although from a very low base (at the official export exchange rate, the price of regular gasoline is US$O.OS per liter). At the same time the Majlis JJ approved further measures that would effectively allow oil product prices to be raised by about 20 percent annually during the SFYDP. Moreover, electricitv rates were raised by 20 percent and exemptions from import taxes were rescinded for a number of large enterprises, including the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). The budget incorporates an explicit provision for foreign exchange losses in connection with the servicing of refinanced debt. The mission expressed the view that, on current policies, the fiscal deficit could be higher than budgeted (which it estimated at 1.8 percent of GDP in the baseline scenario). The main areas of concern were: (i) the adequacy of the provision for foreign exchange losses; (ii) budgeted measures which had not yet been taken to augment import taxes and other revenues; and (iii) the adverse effect on expenditures of the recent large price increases. Moreover, revenue is vulnerable to lower oil export earnings. The authorities shared the staff's concern regarding possible overruns in foreign exchange losses. However, they were confident that timely action would be taken in the course of the year to realize the budgeted levels for import taxes and other revenue, in part because many of the measures did not require Majlis approval to be implemented. They also saw room for some increase in nontax revenues if needed to achieve the revenue target. On the expenditure side, part of capital expenditures depended on receipt of earmarked revenues in order to be undertaken. For the other part, quarterly budget reviews would be made where noncore development projects could be scaled back if government revenues were weak or an overrun emerged in foreign exchange losses. Consequently, they believed that the overall deficit target would be achieved. Turning to the structure of the budget, the mission expressed concern over the sharp increases in subsidies for consumers and producers during the last few years. The authorities explained that this was due to exchange rate depreciation, increases in domestic procurement and international prices, and population growth. They pointed out, however, that the real per capita amount of subsidies was lower (in U.S. dollar terms) partly due to fewer coupons being issued for consumers to buy essential consumer goods at subsidized prices. Except for wheat, the share of subsidized consumption was relatively low (8-28 percent). 2J Noting the sizable cost of implicit lJ The Iranian legislature. 2J Currently, the number of goods subsidized relative to the total number sold is 100 percent for wheat products and agricultural pesticides, 87 percent for fertilizer, 28 percent for both vegetable shortening and sugar, 19 percent for cheese, 12 percent for rice, 10 percent for milk, and 8 percent for meat. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - and explicit subsidies, the mission urged that wheat and fertilizer subsidies be contained and that plans be accelerated for introducing a unified and well-targeted social safety net system. I/ The cost of total imnlicit netroleum DrOdUCt subsidies in 1994/95 was placed at about US$7 billion (measured at the more appreciated official rate). The mission urged phased but front-loaded increases in domestic oil product prices to the ex-refinery levels in major international refining centers within the SFYDP period. The increase in fuel prices would enable the Government to make well-targeted and transparent budget transfers to compensate vulnerable households and certain producers while strengthening government finances and improving resource allocation. The mission also underscored that low retail prices of petroleum products had contributed to the rising trend in domestic oil consumption in recent years which, if continued, would increasingly constrain Iran's oil exports. The authorities recognized the need to raise domestic oil product prices but felt that this must be done gradually as five decades of subsidies had entrenched them in the structure of production and consumer budgets. Looking further at the budget structure, the mission noted the heavy reliance on revenues from volatile crude oil exports and urged the expansion of non-oil revenues. This could come from introducing a VAT, converting specific excises to ad valorem, adopting a market-related exchange rate for customs valuation, and further improvement in tax administration and enforcement. 2J The authorities generally agreed with these recommendations. They indicated that a redrafted VAT law would be presented to the Majlis in the near future and that the Government intended to convert specific excises to ad valorem as part of the SF'YDP. 2. Monetary policv The budget law for 1995/96 specified a Rls 6.7 trillion increase in the banking system's net claims on the Government and gross claims on nongovernment borrowers (equivalent to 10.6 percent of the stock of broad money at the beginning of the year), compared with Rls 7 trillion (14.3 percent) in 1994/95. On the basis of this target and the virtually I/ Iran has received technical assistance on design of the social safety net from the Fund's Fiscal Affairs Department and the World Bank. The immediate task is to improve the targeting and coverage of the existing coupon system and those of the cash transfers to the poor. To this end, the authorities are planning to undertake a survey of living standards from which a poverty profile will be drawn. In addition, the Government would need to implement a cost-effective mechanism to cushion the impact of higher domestic energy prices on the most vulnerable social groups and economic sectors. 2/ For instance, a stronger enforcement effort could be made regarding the collection of corporate income tax from the enterprises under the control of the foundations.

For instance, provisions for preventing bank overdrafts appeared to be ineffective. More broadly, the mission wondered about the degree of control that the Bank Markazi had over credit to banks. Finally, and most importantly, the low rates of return on government bonds (averaging 4 percent) had rendered open market operations unattractive and impracticai :as banks'could not hold more bonds without affecting their profitability. In view of these difficulties, the mission recommended that the Bank Markazi considerimposing direct credit controls while improving the effectiveness of indirect instruments. The authorities were confident that the targeted growth rate could be realized in 1995/96 as long as fiscal performance was as budgeted. As noted, they shared some concern about the adequacy of budgetary provisions for the Bank Markazi's foreign exchange losses. Regarding the effectiveness of current monetary instruments, stiffer penalties on overdrafts would be enforced and government bonds would be allocated to banks as needed for monetary policy purposes. Monetary developments would be followed closely, particularly toward the end of the year when.rapid monetary expansion traditionally occurred. The rates of return on bank deposits and rates of charge on bank facilities were increased at the start of 1995/96 (see Table 3). Nevertheless, rates remained substantially negative in real terms-- increasingly so as inflation had risen. The mission pointed to the observed relation between the declining real return on deposits and the steady increase in velocity, which reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy (Chart 5). It also pointed out that a positive rate structure would reduce demand for credit and improve the efficiency of its use. The authorities'concurred with the mission's view but felt that large increases in rates to bring them to positive real levels might be misinterpreted as indicating that the authorities expected high inflation to persist. Not only would this raise costs and thence prices, but it could also create expectations that would generate higher inflation. Thus, the authorities aimed to restore positive rates by having low monetary growth bring inflation down and, to a lesser extent, by adjusting nominal rates. The mission recommended that the scope of mandatorv credit allocations be phased down. The authorities responded that this scheme was needed as long as there were differential rates of charge for various sectors. Otherwise banks would lend less to preferred sectors that had the lowest rates of charge, particularly to agriculture. The mission encouraged the authorities to strengthen prudential bank supervision along the lines discussed with the‘June/July 1995 MAE technical assistance mission.

The authorities indicated that prudential supervision would be improved and expressed interest in further technical assistance. The mission added that the authorities might give consideration to whether banks needed to be restructured, especially if an increase in rates of charge were to have an impact on the quality of banks' portfolios. 3. External sector oolicies The current account of the balance of navments is projected to register a surplus, although not as large as in 1994/95 (USS3.6 billion, down from USS4.6 billion--see Table 4). This would more than offset the projected deficit in the capital account (mainly on account of repayments of the refinanced debt) and contribute to an improvement in the reserves position. The mission noted that the need to generate a large current account surplus underscored the importance of maintaining a realistic and competitive level for the official export rate. lJ The authorities believed that the current level (Rls 3,000 per US$l) was competitive and sustainable during 1995/96, although it was not immutable until the end of the year. The current level had been determined on the basis of three indicators --purchasing power parity, specific competitiveness of certain traded goods, and a market supply-demand model--as well as the free market rate in 1994 (although the level of the free market rate in the more recent months was not considered relevant because special factors had come into play). In the event that the exchange market came under pressure, the authorities would take actions from among the following: (i) transfer some transactions from the official rate (Rls 1,750 per US$l) to the export rate; (ii) tighten monetary policy; (iii) intensify efforts to decrease smuggling; and (iv) review the rate itself. The authorities stressed that they were not allocating foreign exchange at the official export rate, nor had any intention to do so. l-hey emphasized that there were no restrictions on current international payments at the export rate other than those arising from payment arrears, the advance import deposit requirement, and the reduced allowance for foreign travel. The mission urged early exchanne rate unification, at a market-related rate, which could be done at the start of 1996/97 when the new budget would be introduced. The authorities indicated that reunification was an aim during the SFYDP period. However, for this to occur, a number of conditions were necessary, These included a positive environment regarding monetary conditions and the external situation, as well as consolidation of the lJ Following the policy package adopted in May, current transactions at the official export rate (Rls 3,000 per US$l) encompass all those that used to be conducted in the free market (off-shore and nonbank authorized dealers).

They agreed that, if the official export rate were to depreciate further, the gap between the two official rates should not widen, although they recognized that it would be difficult to move the more appreciated official rate because it was a partial substitute for a more comprehensive social safety net. The authorities stated that the imposition of sanctions by the United States would have little impact on exports and imports. Given the relative homogeneity of crude petroleum and its large international market, it should not be too difficult to sustain the level of exports. However, the impact on direct foreign investment in petroleum and other industries was less certain. Although direct foreign investment has been negligible, foreign interest and investment have recently increased and this momentum might be affected. Similarly, the authorities pointed to their success in reaching an agreement with a major international oil company to develop two large offshore oil fields and they were going ahead to invite tenders for ten additional projects, also on "buy-back" terms. lJ The authorities emphasized strongly their full commitment to service external debt obligations on time, so as to complete promptly the full normalization of relations with creditors. The goal was to regularize the remaining arrears within six months through ongoing bilateral negotiations. Iran's external debt is projected to decline by more than US$2 billion to US$20 billion during 1995/96 (see Table 4). The key to meeting debt service obligations on schedule is to maintain a current account surplus through moderate import growth from the 1994/95 level and steady growth of non-oil exports. Moderate import growth is reasonable because the high levels in the immediate post-war period reflected reconstruction activity, an overvalued exchange rate, and expansionary macroeconomic policies. To maintain a current account surplus, the mission noted that fiscal and monetary policies would have to be as targeted and exchange policy would have to aim at realistic and competitive rates. As regards trade policies, the authorities explained that import licensing was practiced to protect domestic producers. Licenses, where needed, were given by the ministries responsible for the industries corresponding to the goods being imported. For many commodities, ministries issued general licenses at the beginning of the year. In these cases, importers were not required to obtain individual licenses. The authorities stressed that, for a limited number of goods, individual import licenses were required to protect domestic producers. The mission noted that this form of protection was neither efficient nor transparent and hampered 1/ Under these terms, the investing partner recovers its investment in exchange for oil at an agreed rate of return over the duration of the contract.

As such, it should be replaced by tariffs, which would have the added advantage of augmenting government revenues. 1;/ The authorities are studying the requirements and consequences of membership in the WTO, so as to assess the possibility of joining. 4. Suonlv side nolicies The mission emphasized the need to pursue policies that would enhance the supply response of the economy, particularly privatization; would encourage foreign investment; and would remove rigidities in the labor market. As regards privatization, the authorities reported that it was difficult to assess the actual extent of privatization of medium- and large-scale companies since they had been mostly sold through the Teheran Stock Exchange (TSE) where state-owned banks, their investment subsidiaries, and foundations (quasi-public Islamic institutions) had bought a large proportion of the shares. Overall, it was felt that there had been little improvement in efficiency for many of the medium- and large-scale companies that had been privatized. Thus, the authorities were looking into ways to increase private participation in sales through the TSE. The mission inquired about the foreign investment regime, particularly whether Article 81 of the constitution could be interpreted as prohibiting foreign investment. 2J The authorities clarified that, due to historical experience in Iran, this provision prohibited the Government from granting exclusive privileges to foreign investors but did not ban foreign investment itself. In view of this, the mission suggested that the authorities use publicity to dispel such a misinterpretation. 5. Sectoral nolicies a. Oil and gas The authorities stated their desire for a stable world oil market, achieved through a dialogue between producers and consumers, as well as among oil producers, underscoring their commitment to OPEC production and pricing policies. They believed that the current large excess production capacity in the world would disappear early in the next century. IJ A tariff reform is presently being considered by the Majlis. Information on this and current tariff policy is provided in the report on Recent Economic Developments. 2/ This article reads: "The granting of any concessions and privileges to foreigners for establishing companies and institutions in the fields of trade, industry, agriculture, mines, and services is absolutely prohibited."

A decline in crude oil production from 3.7 million barrels per day (mbd) in 1992/93 to 3.6 mbd in 1993/94 and 1994/95 had been entirely due to OPEC's lower production ceiling for Iran. Iran's sustainable crude production capacity was about 4.2 mbd which the authorities intended to raise to 5.0 mbd by 2000 to meet the expected increase in world demand. To mobilize the large amount of investment needed to realize this increase, the Government was negotiating with potential partners for joint ventures. The authorities added that their strategy was to take advantage of the natural gas reserves (21 trillion cubic meters) to replace oil by gas in domestic consumption. Under consideration were projects to export gas to neighboring countries and Europe. b. Agriculture The authorities related that agricultural policy aimed at self-sufficiency in wheat and maximum production of other crops. This policy included subsidizing part of the cost of certain inputs and offering guaranteed procurement prices for 16 crops. However, since procurement prices were generally below domestic market prices, the Government had procured only 7 percent of all agricultural products during the FFYDP. Subsidies for machinery and imported seeds had been eliminated; the policy was to remove subsidies for fertilizers and pesticides in 5 and 2 years, respectively. C. Industry The mission expressed concern that subsidized inputs (including foreign exchange, credit, and oil products), price controls, and import licensing distorted activity in this sector. The authorities stated that less than 50 items were subject to import licensing and noted that the regulations issued following the exchange market turbulence in May 1995 had only required sellers to post their prices but not to fix prices. The mission encouraged that a hard budget constraint be imposed on public and quasi-public enterprises; that these enterprises be restructured where necessary; and that their management be made more effective. 6. Medium-term outlook The mission noted that the authorities' policy stance is consistent with meeting scheduled debt service--their key objective. However, it would be difficult to fully achieve the SFYDP growth and inflation objectives.

This surplus is predicated, inter alia, on the containment of imports around an average of about US$16 billion and maintenance of a competitive export exchange rate which would contribute to a 10 percent annual growth of non-oil exports. Under the high-growth scenario, the economy would benefit from larger mobilization of domestic savings. Specifically, public sector savings would rise by about 7 percentage points of GDP over the projection period (compared with an increase of less than 2 GDP percentage points in the baseline scenario). This improvement would reflect an increase in budgetary revenue which would be based mainly on much higher domestic prices of petroleum products. The higher domestic savings, together with greater availability of external financing, would both enable a higher level of domestic investment and a reduction in the magnitude of the current account .surplus that Iran would need to remain current on its debt service obligations. These conditions, together with improved resource.allocation, would contribute to the more rapid GDP growth. The illustrative projections show lower liquidity growth with declining velocity of broad money and better inflation performance in the high-growth scenario. The decline in velocity, together with a reduction in the domestic financing requirement of the public enterprises, would create space in the monetary program for faster growth of credit to the private sector and for somewhat higher budget deficits. The latter would reflect higher outlays associated with rehabilitating the economic infrastructure, covering the cost of certain reforms (such as privatization and restructuring of banks and public enterprises), and supporting an expanded social safety net. 7. Statistical issues The coverage, quality, and timeliness of the data provided to the mission permitted it to make a realistic assessment of economic developments and to form a perspective on the economy's medium-term prospects. In view of improvements being made in price statistics and classification of government expenditures with technical assistance from international organizations, the capital account of the balance of payments now deserves lJ The methodology and assumptions underlying the two scenarios are described in Appendix II. Regarding the high import levels of 1990/91-1992/93, it should be noted that they were partly due to massive public sector imports under the FFYDP, lax financial policies, and an overvalued exchange rate. Accordingly, considerably lower levels are realistic, partly because import-substituting enterprises have started operations during the last three years (most notably in the petrochemical sector).

There has already been an improvement in recording debt and debt-service obligations since the establishment of the Bank Markazi's Foreign Debt Department. However, the errors and omissions item is still large and a precise link cannot be established between the external capital account and the commercial banks' net foreign assets in the monetary survey. In addition, there are differences in bank financing of the budget deficit between the budget accounts and the monetary accounts that call for further improvement in compiling the budget accounts. The mission urged the authorities to send a regular and timely flow of data to the Fund for analysis and publication, as well as to promptly publish statistics domestically. lJ Planned visits to the Fund by Iranian officials and a mid-cycle staff visit to Teheran would facilitate both the transmission of data and the exchange of analyses. IV. Staff Anoraisal The policies implemented during the FFYDP (1989/90-1993/94) led to many positive achievements --average annual growth of 7 percent, greater and more diversified agricultural output, rapid growth of non-oil exports, and improved social indicators. However, serious macroeconomic imbalances emerged in the second half of the Plan period which have not yet been fully corrected and key structural issues remain to be resolved. The authorities presently face a challenging situation in the form of heavy external debt service obligations over the next few years. At the same time, there is an urgent need to address serious price distortions for oil products, foreign exchange, and bank deposits and credit. Compounding these challenges, the external environment poses difficulties arising from sanctions, limited access to international credit, and uncertain international oil prices. In addition, inadequate domestic resource mobilization and quasi-fiscal losses have contributed to rising inflation, slowing growth, and exchange market pressures. The authorities' resolute determination to regularize the external arrears that accumulated in 1992/93-1993/94 and to service rescheduled and other external debt without incurring further arrears is laudable. This course of action has been followed with determination although the required reduction in imports has contributed to slower growth and higher inflation. The staff also welcomes the recently adopted policies imparting greater transparency to the budget and a more realistic structure of the exchange system. Nevertheless, a number of policy changes are needed. lJ In view of delays in publishing the central bank's quarterly review, consideration was being given to issuing a monthly statistical bulletin in a simplified form. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - On the basis of current policies and conditions, medium-term prospects are for international reserves to rise gradually and external debt to be serviced on schedule after regularizing the remaining external payment arrears. However, the present fiscal and credit policies need to be reinforced and structural policies intensified for a sufficiently rapid decline in inflation, a revival of high growth, and a satisfactory degree of nominal stability in the official export exchange rate. The policy formulation process should be made more responsive to changes in the economic environment. In addition, policy instruments should be directed to appropriate tasks; for instance the exchange rate system is not the best suited instrument for providing support to low-income groups or to preferred industries, while monetary policy should concentrate on restoring macroeconomic stability as a foundation for sustainable growth and fiscal policy should support monetary policy with expenditures redirected towards infrastructural and social purposes. To achieve the broad objective of high noninflationary growth it is of fundamental importance that the authorities formulate and implement at an early date a comprehensive and appropriately strong package of mutually reinforcing stabilization and structural reform policies. A key element of such a package would be a stronger fiscal stance that would mobilize greater domestic resources. Initially, the main source of additional government revenue would be adjustments in domestic petroleum prices. Over the medium term, revenue from non-oil sources including agriculture must be raised from measures such as introducing a VAT, converting specific excises to ad valorem, and adopting a market-related exchange rate for customs valuation. State and quasi-state enterprises should be corporatized and a strategy developed for going forward with privatization. Reduced borrowing by public enterprises would allow monetary expansion to be contained at levels that would be consistent with lower inflation. The effectiveness of monetary policy could be strengthened by resorting to bank-by-bank credit ceilings to backstop the use of indirect monetary instruments while their effectiveness is being improved. At the same time, rates of return and rates of charge should be raised to positive real levels to reverse the steady climb of velocity and encourage intermediation. The authorities should reduce the scope of mandatory credit allocation and strengthen prudential supervision of banks and nonbank intermediaries in order to lay the foundation for a more market oriented banking system. A unified, well targeted, and transparent social safety net needs to be designed and implemented to permit relative price distortions to be removed in the exchange system, domestic oil product market, and the banking system. In the short run, domestic oil product prices would need to be raised substantially to cover the budget cost of a well targeted social safety net. The additional revenue from higher oil prices would also provide for what needs to be a well-defined and time-bound mechanism of budget transfers to a few industries that might require temporary support; it could also be used to cushion the impact on banks of higher rates of return on deposits. In Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - this regard, it would be imperative that budgetary support be combined with an appropriate restructuring of industrial units and financial institutions. There should be further phased increases' in oil product prices to bring them to international levels within the SFYDP period so as to improve productive efficiency. As regards external policies, the official export exchange rate should respond quickly to market conditions. Simultaneously, actions should be taken to close the gap between the two official exchange rates so as to unify them, at the latest, at the outset of 1996/97. In the near future, import licensing should be replaced by customs tariffs. The authorities are strongly urged to regularize the remaining external payment arrears and to limit further resort to short-term borrowing. The May modification in the exchange system--involving the imposition of full repatriation and surrender requirements for non-oil export proceeds- -was in response to exceptional pressures on the foreign exchange market. The staff encourages the authorities to specify a timetable to remove exchange controls at an early date and to reduce the role of Bank Markazi in the foreign exchange market as soon as the enabling circumstances are in place, including a more market-based structure of rates of return in the financial system. The staff is scheduled to discuss further with the authorities in September a possible timetable for phasing out these restrictions. The staff will inform Executive Directors of any developments in this regard before the Board meeting in the supplement referred to in the Introduction. The staff welcomes the progress made by Iran in strengthening its database. This, together with enhanced transmittal of data to the Fund, will facilitate effective surveillance. Nevertheless, data deficiencies remain, especially regarding the capital account of the balance of payments. The staff recommends that further actions be taken to strengthen statistical systems. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Iran be held on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

The scenarios illustrate macroeconomic prospects under: (i) the relatively gradualistic approach to adjustment and structural reform currently being pursued by the authorities (baseline scenario); and (ii) a stronger and more front-loaded adjustment and structural reform effort which would mobilize greater domestic and foreign savings and thereby enable the economy to move to a higher growth path (high-growth scenario). The following steps have been followed in developing each scenario: (a) develop balance payments projections (b) develop real GDP growth and inflation assumptions (c) develop exchange rate assumptions (d) make monetary projection consistent with inflation and growth path (e) combine steps (a) and (b) to determine path for domestic credit (0 assume credit requirements of private sector and nonfinancial public enterprises (g) develop budgetary revenue outlook (h) solve for the feasible level of budgetary expenditure, thereby determining the overall budget deficit corresponding to each scenario (i) develop an illustrative path for gross domestic investment and gross national savings 1. Balance navments nroiections In the baseline scenario, the projections are consistent with the outlook envisaged by the authorities for the SFYDP. A key element in the current account is trade in petroleum (crude and products) and gas. For 1995/96-1999/2000, exports of crude oil are projected to rise gradually from 2.49 mbd in 1995/96 to 2.65 mbd in 1999/2000. For 1995/96, the average per barrel price of Iranian oil, as reflected in the budget, was forecasted at US$lS per barrel. Crude oil export prices for the ensuing years were projected using this base price augmented by the Fund's WE0 growth forecast. During 1995/96-1999/2000, exports of petroleum products are projected to average about 0.94 mbd and to follow a declining trend. Petroleum product export price projections use the 1994/95 average export prices for Iran as base and the WE0 forecasts. Gas exports are forecast to rise by about 10 percent per annum during the projection horizon. Overall, oil and gas export earnings were projected to reach USS14.8 billion in 1995/96 (up from USS14.6 billion during 1994/95), and to average about US$lS billion during 1996/97-1999/2000. A key element in the capital account is the schedule for servicing the refinanced debt, which was provided by the authorities. The high-growth scenario is predicated on the following changes relative to the baseline, beginning in 1996/97: (i) higher non-oil exports (15 percent a year, compared with 10 percent for the baseline); (ii) higher Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - APPENDIX II direct foreign investment; and (iii) higher medium- and long-term financing, albeit with a still declining total debt outstanding. Imports were determined residually by assuming the same level of reserves in terms of months of imports as in the baseline projection. 2. GDP growth The target of 5 percent real GDP growth over the SF'YDP period seemed overly optimistic in view of the nominal import growth embodied in the baseline balance of payments (averaging 7.6 percent in U.S. dollar terms during 1996/97-1999/2000). Accordingly, it was decided to scale the growth rate down to 3 percent in the baseline scenario. Admittedly, this may still be optimistic in view of the low initial level of imports in 1995/96. In the high-growth scenario, the real growth rate was assumed at 7 percent. This takes into account higher import growth (averaging 10.4 percent per year during 1996/97-1999/2000) as well as an enhanced supply responsiveness in the economy as the result of structural reforms (notably improved financial intermediation and removal of price distortions). 3. Inflation Inflation was assumed to be higher (in the 20-30 percent range) in the baseline scenario reflecting weaker financial policies. The exception to this is in 1996/97, when inflation would be higher in the high growth scenario under the impact of steeper administrative price adjustments, particularly a more ambitious removal of energy subsidies. 4. Exchange rates In both scenarios, the official "export" rate is assumed to be depreciated by the difference between domestic and external inflation. In the baseline scenario, the more appreciated official rate converges to the official export rate in three steps, with unification taking place in 1998/99. In the high-growth scenario, the exchange rates are unified in one step in 1996/97. 5. Monetary oroiections Broad money growth is given by the nominal GDP growth rate, modified by the change in velocity. In the baseline scenario, velocity is assumed to continue to increase (by 1 percent per year) whereas in the high growth scenario it is assumed to decline (by 1 percent per year).

Credit requirements of the nongovernmental sectors The stock of credit to the private sector has been assumed as a constant ratio to GDP in both scenarios. Bank borrowing by the nonfinancial public enterprises is assumed constant at 1.9 percent of GDP (the 1994/95 level) in the baseline scenario, consistent with no adjustment in their operations. In the high-growth scenario, it is assumed that these enterprises would undertake an adjustment effort sufficient to bring their bank borrowing down to 1.0 percent of GDP by the last year of the projection period. 7. Budpetarv revenues Simulations were made for both oil and non-oil revenues. Revenues from exports of crude oil and gas were projected in line with data on export quantities provided by the authorities, and WE0 oil price projections. Non-oil revenues were broken down between revenues from domestic sales of petroleum products and other revenues. I/ In the baseline scenario, revenues from domestic sales of petroleum products were projected assuming that their retail prices would rise by 20 percent per annum during 1996/97-1999/2000, as planned under the SFYDP. All other non-oil revenues were projected to increase in line with nominal GDP. In the high-growth scenario, oil and gas export earnings were also projected using data furnished by the authorities and the WE0 prices. However, domestic petroleum product prices were projected to increase at rates that would allow reaching paritv with Singapore soot prices for petroleum oroducts bv 1999/2000. Currently, the extent of disparity between Iranian retail prices and international prices depends on the category of petroleum products. For example, relative to international prices, fuel oil prices are the lowest and gasoline prices the highest among the petroleum product prices. Hence, each category of products was increased at different rates in order to permit reaching full parity by the end of the SFYDP in 1999/2000. For example, during 1996/97, gasoline prices were projected to rise by about 60 oercent per annum, while fuel oil prices were raised by 145 percent per annum. Other non-oil revenues were projected to rise in line with the nominal GDP target under the growth scenario. 8. Investment and savinps The illustrative investment/savings ratios to GDP were generated by taking the 1994/95 initial positions and assuming that any improvement in the current account balance in the baseline scenario would reflect a decline in investment (with constant savings); and any worsening in the current L;/ Petroleum product categories included: gasoline, kerosene, gas oil, fuel oil, and other.

Conversely, any improvement in the current account in the high-growth scenario is taken as reflecting an increase in savings (with constant investment); and any worsening is taken as resulting from an increase in investment (with constant savings). Admittedly, this illustration may overstate the discrepancy between the investment/savings implications of the scenarios.

Nonfinancial Relations VII. Exchange Svstem Since mid-May 1995 the Islamic Republic of Iran has been operating a dual exchange rate system consisting of an official exchange rate pegged at Rls 1,750 per US$l and a second official exchange rate--the "export" rate--pegged at Rls 3,000 per US$l. Over the last several years, the official foreign exchange market has operated mostly under a multiple exchange system. In March 1993, the official exchange rate was unified and floated on the basis of the free market rate. In December 1993, the floating system was abandoned and the official exchange rate was fixed at Rls 1,750 per US$l. In May 1994, the authorities re-introduced a second official exchange rate--the "export" rate --at Rls 2,345 per US$l; the more Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - APPENDIX III appreciated official rate (Rls 1750 per US$l) continued to be applied to oil exports, imports of essential goods, and official capital inflows and debt service. In January 1995, a 50 percent repatriation and surrender requirement was imposed on non-oil export proceeds which was raised to 100 percent in May 1995. Also in May 1995, the official export rate was depreciated from Rls 2,345 to Rls 3,000 per US$l. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on October 20, 1993. The Executive Board adopted the following decision (Decision No.10495-(93/145)): 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the Islamic Republic of Iran's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3, and in concluding the 1993 Article XIV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran, in the light of the 1993 Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. The exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices described in Part A of Appendix V of SM/93/210 are subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. The Fund notes the authorities' intention to move expeditiously toward the elimination of these restrictions by March 1994 and grants approval for the retention of the exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices described in Part A of Appendix V of SM/93/210 until March 20, 1994. The Islamic Republic of Iran also has inoperative bilateral payments agreements with Fund members as described in Part B of Appendix V of SM/93/210. The Fund urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to eliminate the restrictive features of these agreements as soon as possible. IX. Technical Assistance The Fund has provided technical assistance to Iran to improve the policy related statistical base and to enhance the conduct of economic policies. In December 1994, a STA mission provided technical assistance to revise the wholesale price index and MAE provided assistance on the exchange system. A MAE mission which overlapped with the 1995 Article IV mission provided assistance in strengthening the prudential regulation and supervision of commercial banks.

The lending program for that period had 33 operations for which the Bank disbursed a total of US$1,023 million, most of which has been repaid. From 1957 to 1969 lending was mainly for roads, irrigation, and industrial credit, while from 1969 to 1974 lending was diversified to include power, telecommunications, agriculture, education, population, and urban transport. In 1975-76 the Bank's relations with Iran focused increasingly on technical assistance, in particular in the agricultural sector. During 1959-74 the IFC was also involved in Iran through a number of operations with the Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran and the Iran Industrial Credit Bank. Following discussions at the 1989 Annual Meetings, an exploratory Bank mission visited Iran at the end of November that year and was followed by a full economic mission in March 1990. Since the time of the last Article IV consultations, the Bank has prepared a transport sector review, an environmental strategy study, a report on capital markets and financial institutions, and a labor market study. The Bank has also prepared a country economic memorandum which has not yet been published. The Bank resumed lending to Iran in March 1991 and has approved six loans so far. The Bank Group has not approved any new loans for Iran in the past two years; for loans approved over the 1991-93 period, the status of Bank Group operations as of March 1995 is shown below.

In the past, the flow of statistics has been irregular. However, to improve the flow of data (as well as to facilitate exchange of views), it has been agreed that direct contacts will be more frequent (in the form of a staff visit to Teheran between consultation missions and regular visits to Washington by Iranian officials). In addition, periodic data requests by and responses to STA will be channeled through the Executive Director's office. 1. Real sector Price statisttcs have generally been reported to the Fund through STA in a timely manner. Two STA assistance missions on price statistics have visited Teheran in the last two years. The first, in February 1993, reported that most price indices are conceptually sound and compiled in accordance with international standards. The second mission, in December 1994, recommended replacing the current Wholesale Price Index (WPI) by three new price indices: (i) a Producer Price Index covering all industrial and agricultural goods, with the possible exception of petroleum products, (ii) an export price index, and (iii) an import price index. Export and import price indices based on the export and import components of the WPI have recently been reported to STA with updates through December 1993. The National Account Department of Bank Markazi and the United Nations Statistics Division had a joint project during 1990-93 to improve the conceptual framework and compilation techniques for the national accounts. Currently, national account statistics are basically sound and compilation competently takes account of the new SNA methodologies. The consultation mission recefved national account estimates for 1994/95. 2. Government accounts The consultation mission received fiscal accounts of the general government (Central Government and 25 provincial governments) through 1994/95 (the accounts for the last year being preliminary estimates) and the budget for 1995/96. Monthly and quarterly data have not been reported in the past. Data were also provided on government transfers to cover public enterprises' financial losses, the 1995/96 budget for the enterprises, and the fiscal outturns for a small but important group of enterprises during 1992/93-1993/94. The STA database contains annual data for the consolidated Central Government through 1993. There are differences between data reported to STA and MED on revenue, expenditure, and lending minus repayments, as well as in classifications. Local government data reported to STA are only available Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - APPENDIX V through 1989. Only summarized data on financing has been reported through 1990 and no data beyond 1991. The authorities are currently undertaking to reclassify government expenditures into economic categories with UNDP assistance. There are differences in bank financing of fiscal deficits between the budget and monetary accounts that call for further improvement in compiling the budget accounts. 3. Monetary accounts The mission received monetary data through March 1995. Reporting of monetary data to STA has been infrequent-- three times in 1994 and twice in 1993, although each time updates covered several months. 4. External sector data The establishment of the Bank Markazi's Foreign Debt Department has brought a vast improvement in data on public and publicly guaranteed external debt, debt service, and debt service obligations. Other parts of the capital account of the balance of payments now deserve priority for improvement. The errors and omissions item in the balance of payments has shown large changes from year to year and a precise link cannot be established between the external capital account and the commercial banks' net foreign assets in the monetary accounts. The mission received data on international reserves, the balance of payments, and external debt as of March 1995. Previously, reporting of the balance of payments to STA had lagged. Quarterly balance of payments are not routinely prepared.
