Introduction Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation with Germany were held during May 3-15, 1995. I/ The staff team met with State Secretary Stark of the Ministry of Finance, State Secretary Ludewig of the Ministry of Economy, and other officials of these and other ministries in Bonn; with President Tietmeyer and other officials of the Bundesbank in Frankfurt; and with private sector organizations in Halle, Cologne, and Duesseldorf. Mr. Schoenberg, Executive Director for Germany, participated in the discussions. Germany has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 2, 1994. On that occasion, Directors had been pleased to note that unification-induced imbalances were coming under control. Inflationary pressures had abated, and the economic upswing was gathering pace, although it remained vulnerable to weakness in domestic demand. Directors especially welcomed the progress made on fiscal consolidation, and they supported the authorities' medium-term plans in this respect. Several Directors saw some scope for a further easing of short-term interest rates, which they noted would help consolidate the recovery both in Germany and in the rest of Europe. All agreed on the need to address structural rigidities, in the labor market and elsewhere, that had been exposed by the recent recession. II. Recent DeveloDments Five years after unification, the German economy is back on a much more even keel (Chart 1). The boom-bust cycle triggered by deficit-financed fiscal transfers to eastern Germany has given way to a steady recovery, which has entered its third year. Output has recovered to well above its pre-recession peak, inflation is subdued, and the fiscal deficit has been cut back sharply. Unemployment, however, remains high. l/ The staff team consisted of Mr. Artus (Head), Mr. Vittas, Mr. Corker, Ms. van der Willigen (all EUl), Mr. Montgomery (RES), Mr. Mauro (EP, PDR), and Ms. Rome (SEC, assistant).

An assessment of developments in the first part of 1995 is complicated by serious lags in data availability, as the coverage of many statistics is expanded from western to united Germany, and sectoral classifications are brought into line with EU standards. I/ However, industrial surveys suggest that growth has continued, albeit at a slightly slower pace than during 1994. As in past cycles, extorts led the way out of the recession (Chart 2). They were boosted initia:Lly by growth in the US, the UK, and some developing countries, and later by the recovery in the rest of continental Europe. Export growth was also underpinned by import.ant restructuring efforts in industry, which yielded large productivity gain.5. A sharp rise in orders toward the end of 1994, as well as data for the first part of 1995, point to continued strong growth in exports at least through the summer of 1995. However, export prospects for late 1995 and 1996 have been clouded by a 5 l/2 percent real effective appreciation of the deutsche mark in the early part of 1995. Both export expectations and business confidence weakened markedly in the first few months of the year, before strengthening a little in May. Domestic demand has also begun to revive, with investment becoming the second engine of growth (IChart 3). In eastern Germany, double-digit increases in investment had been the mainstay of rapid growth for some years. And residential construction :in western Germany had remained buoyant even during the recession. But, with capacity utilization nearing normal levels, business investment in the west also began to pick up in the latter part of 1994, and the most recent surveys- -taken after the exchange rate appreciation--show manufacturers planning to increase their investment by 12 percent in real terms in 1995. By contrast, private consumption, weighed down by tax increases and restrained growth in wages, has remained sluggish. Public consumption too has been held back by fiscal consolidation. The flipside of the industrial restructuring process has been that unemolovment continued to rise well into the economy's recovery phase, and that its decline so far has been modest in the eastern Laender and almost imperceptible in the western Laender (Chart 4). Nonetheless, after great restraint in 1994, wage demands picked! up in the 1995 wage round, and agreed increases averaged about 3 l/2 percent in western Germany, up from 2 percent last year. Innovative moves made toward greater flexibility in a few sectors in 1994 were neither expanded upon nor imitated. Consumer price inflation, which had proved stubborn during the recession, eased gradually to an annualized rate of about 2 percent by the last quarter of 1994, before picking up slightly in June 1995 (Chart 5). By contrast, mainly under the influence of higher international commodity prices, import prices and producer prices --which had been stable or falling --began edging up in mid-1994. Import prices, however, benefitted from the appreciation of the deutsche mark in early 1995. 1/ These deficiencies are most unusual. Germany's record of producing and publishing data is generally excellent (see Appendix III).

Output in the eastern Laender has been growing at close to double-digit rates (Chart 6). The eastern manufacturing sector has recently been playing more of a role in the growth process, which for a time relied strongly on the construction and services sectors. But the manufacturing base remains narrow, and production for the west German market and for exports is limited and relies on a small number of greenfield plants. East German unemployment has eased slightly but remains high, at 13 l/2 percent of the labor force. Despite rapid rises in productivity and a somewhat slower pace of wage convergence with the west (compared both with previous years and with earlier agreements), unit labor costs remain substantially higher in the east than in the west. Fiscal policv has made great strides toward correcting the imbalances induced by unification (Chart 7). Between 1991 and 1993, the general government deficit was kept to at most 3 l/4 percent of GDP, despite the economy's slide from overheating into recession. Further progress was made in 1994, through a combination of tax measures (notably an increase in petroleum taxes) and expenditure savings (including cuts in unemployment benefits). The deficit was cut to 2 l/2 percent of GDP, almost 1 percent of GDP below the level initially planned, reflecting stronger-than-expected growth. With GDP growth close to potential in 1994, the decline in the structural deficit was about 1 percent of GDP. On present estimates, the general government deficit is set to stay at 2 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995, somewhat below the authorities' mid-1994 projection as a result of stronger economic activity. This stable deficit, however, hides a major consolidation effort, which is masked by the servicing of a large amount of previously off-budget debt (notably of the Treuhand, which ceased operations at the end of last year) assumed by the federal authorities at the beginning of 1995. The reimposition of the 7 l/2 percent "solidarity" surcharge on income tax will contribute the bulk of an estimated withdrawal of fiscal stimulus of about 1 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the .assumption of debt will have raised gross general government debt to 58 percent of GDP (a little under the Maastricht ceiling), from 50 percent at end-1994. The first half of 1994 saw a considerable overshooting of the 4-6 percent target range for broad money (M3) growth, due largely to tax changes (relating to investment funds in Luxembourg and to housing construction) and to a steeply inverted yield curve (Chart 8). The authorities nevertheless continued their policy, begun in September 1992, of gradually lowering official short-term interest rates, but now also with a view to persuading investors out of broad money and into the longer end of the market. A new phase of steady interest rates began in mid-1994, with the discount and Lombard rates held at 4 l/2 percent and 6 percent, respec- tively, and the securities repurchase (repo) rate at 4.85 percent, for many months. Ten-year government bond yields, which had climbed steeply in the first half of 1994 from a historical low point of 5 l/2 percent, fluctuated around 7 l/2 percent. With the establishment of a more normal yield curve, M3 stabilized, coming within the target range by the end'of the year. M3-extended, which in addition to M3 includes Euro-deposits and (newly- introduced) money market funds, also barely grew in the second half of 1994. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 4 - The target range for M3 growth for 1995 was again set at 4-6 percent, but was sharply undershot in the early months of the year, when M3 (and M3-extended) fell in absolute terms, as expectations of declining capital market rates gave a further impetus to the switch out of monetary assets. In response, and also reflecting the dampening effect on prices of the appreciation of the deutsche mark, the Bundesbank lowered the discount rate by 50 basis points to 4 percent, and the repo rate by 35 basis points to 4.5 percent, in late March. Short-term market interest rates have broadly followed, and ten-year bond yields have fallen- -though not by quite as much as yields in the US --to stand at about 6 3/4 percent. Since unification, Germany--traditionally a capital exporter--has been running external current account deficits of about 1 percent of GDP (Chart 9). The turnaround in the external position reflects both the high investment needs of the new Laender and a reduction in national savings, itself partly traceable to higher public borrowing. In 1994, strong export growth underpinned a wide,ning of the trade surplus, but this was offset by a deterioration in the balance on invisibles. The current account deficit was more than financed by short-term capital inflows; the long-term capital account reverted to its mlore normal deficit position, after massive inflows during the 1993 bull market in bonds. Both short- and long-term capital .inflows to the banking sy,stem were strong in the first quarter of 1995, perhaps helping to explain the exchange rate appreciation. At the same time, net inflows into bonds and other securities were not unusually high. III. Cutlook The sharp appreciation of the deutsche mark in early 1995 has thrown the spotlight onto issues of competitiveness, which had already come to the fore after a real effective appreciation of about 10 percent in 1992. That earlier movement had been consistent with the requirements of Germany's saving-investment position, which was to swing into deficit as a result of unification and the cost of reconstruction in eastern Germany. The 'more recent movement, by contrast, would tend to widen the saving-investment imbalance just at a time when it should be narrowing, reflecting some ebbing of the effects of unification and espe'cially a continued strengthening of public saving. In this respect, then, the recent appreciation appears to have taken the exchange rate away from what might be an "equilibrium" value. The authorities broadly agreed with thLis assessment by the staff, and traced the strength of the deutsche mark partly to fiscal problems in the US and some European countries, and to uncertain prospects for their resolution. In addition, the authorit:Les b'elieved that markets had overreacted, and they were hopeful that the resulting overshooting would correct itself before too long. lJ Indeed, markets themselves seem to expect some real depreciation of the deutsche mark, at least against the US dollar, over the longer-term; else in the face of widespread expectations of lower inflation in Germany, bond yields in Germany would not be higher than in the US.

Nevertheless, the authorities noted a number of factors that might mitigate the likely loss of export market share. First, the favorable effect of the appreciation on import prices, especially of dollar-denominated commodities, was giving firms some breathing space. Second, investment goods feature prominently among German exports, and the demand for these was rising rapidly in Europe. And third, there was evidence that, thanks to their reputation for quality and reliability, many German products were subject to relatively price-inelastic demand. l-J Further improvements in non-price factors might also help to sustain the momentum of export growth. The staff's latest projection--broadly in line with that of the authorities, and assuming the present exchange rate constellation holds-- calls for all-German growth to remain robust in 1995, at a little over 3 percent, and to slow to a little under 3 percent in 1996. The slight slackening of growth in 1996 would reflect the impact of the recent exchange rate appreciation on exports and thereby also on investment. These effects, however, would be largely offset by a strengthening of consumption, which, after years of tax rises, will benefit from tax cuts, and by the reaction of investment to lower long-term interest rates. The current account would suffer from the appreciation, with the deficit rising closer to 1 l/2 per- cent of GDP in 1996. Unemployment would ease only a little, and would still average 8 3/4 percent of the labor force in 1996. The staff estimates that output would remain below potential in 1996 (by l-l l/2 percent), and with growth not sufficiently rapid to give rise to "speed limit" concerns, the outlook for inflation would remain favorable. Given the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of the apprecia- tion and its impact, this scenario is subject to more than the usual degree of risk. In particular, the slowdown in exports could be either more or less marked than the staff expects, and its effects on business and consumer confidence more or less damaging. Thus one cannot exclude the possibility either of a more significant slowdown, or of a more rapid return to full capacity utilization, with attendant dangers for inflation. Beyond 1996, the staff believes that, barring unexpected developments in interest rates or the external environment, non-inflationary growth could be as high as 3 percent a year for a couple of years on the back of a further recovery in domestic demand. Growth would slow to 2 l/2 percent at the end of the decade as excess capacity in the old Laender is exhausted and expansion in the new Laender eases to a more sustainable pace. Absent a reversal of the recent exchange rate appreciation, the current account deficit would remain above 1 percent of GDP. IV.

The appreciation of the deutsche mark in early 1995 has clouded the picture slightly, but has not fundamentally changed it. Even so, there is no room for complacency. Fiscal consolidation is not yet complete, and its manner so far has raised concerns about the high burden of taxation. Moreover, there has been no progress-.-rather the reverse--on the structural unemployment problem, which is the major weakness in Germany's economic performance. 1. Fiscal nolicy Discussions on fiscal policy proceeded from a recognition on both sides that a major consolidation effort had already been carried out (see tabulation below), and that fiscal targets in recent years had been not only achieved but exceeded. Indeed, with the general government deficit at 2 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 and debt below 60 percent of GDP, Germany was one of a very few EU countries that satisfied the fiscal criteria in the Maastricht Treaty. Adjusted for the below-normal level of activity, the underlying general government deficit was even lower. Moreover, the public finances seemed set to continue to strengthen in 1995, as the interest cost (l/2 percent of GDP) of extrabudgetary obligations taken over by the Federal Government was likely to be absorbed without an increase in the federal or general government deficit.

JJ During the 198Os, government spending had gradually been whittled down from 50 percent of GDP to 46 percent, but unification had undone these efforts, and spending had ballooned back to over 50 percent of GDP. The authorities' objective lJ See Appendix II for details of the authorities' and the staff's medium-term fiscal projections.

Some of this reduction in spending would accommodate tax cuts planned for 1996, as well as a declining trend in nontax revenues. The remainder would create scope for "symmetrical" reductions of 1 l/2 percent of GDP each in the deficit--which would shrink to 1 percent of GDP in the year 2000--and in taxes and social security contributions. The staff fully endorsed the authorities' emphasis on deficit and tax reduction, and stressed that on both counts it was important to be as ambitious as possible. Beyond the turn of the century, Germany--like many other industrial countries--would face new, massive challenges in the form of the ageing of the population and the threat of sharply rising social security costs. The social consensus in Germany would probably preclude substantial cutbacks in benefits to the aged at this time, and it was thus all the more important in the remainder of this decade to create room to accommodate these new demands. This meant securing very low deficits (preferably lower, at the peak of the cycle, than the 1 percent of GDP in the official medium-term plan), a reduced public debt (the plan still put government debt at well over 50 percent of GDP in the year 2000), and a low tax burden. Further fiscal consolidation was also desirable from an international perspective, as it would alleviate pressures on real interest rates and improve the availability of capital both at home and abroad. The authorities were confident that their expenditure targets for the medium-term- -which required spending to grow by about l/2 percent annually in real terms --could be met largely without radical measures. They pointed to a number of areas where it should be easy to hold back spending-- especially public investment and, through further civil service and defense sector job cuts, public consumption. Industrial subsidies, including those to eastern Germany, would also continue to be steadily eroded in real terms. There was potential, too, especially at the level of the Laender and local authorities, for further privatization of government functions and for a lowering of overly high standards for public facilities. The staff acknowledged that a strategy of across-the-board expenditure restraint had borne fruit in recent years, but wondered whether its very success was not now yielding diminishing room for maneuver. Medium-term projections suggested that spending would rise by about 1 l/2 percent a year in real terms merely as a result of growth in entitlement programs, even if government consumption and investment were kept constant in real terms (see Appendix II). The staff thus stressed the importance of facing up to difficult choices in the more sensitive areas, such as social transfers and subsidies to mining, housing, and agriculture. Tough decisions would probably be needed just to meet the official medium-term targets; certainly they would be unavoidable in the longer term. In the staff's view--unlike in the authorities'--the risk of a failure to reach a consensus on expenditure savings was real. Thus, until a more durable position of fiscal balance was reasonably assured, tax cuts should be limited to those already mandated by the Constitutional Court. These court-ordered tax cuts dominated the fiscal landscape for 1996. The Constitutional Court had directed that income up to the subsistence Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicminimum should be free of income tax, and the authorities' proposal for complying with this ruling would cost 0.5.percent of GDP. The Court had also outlawed the "coal penny", a levy on electricity that had been used to finance coal subsidies and which had been worth 0.2 percent of GDP. In addition, the authorities had proposed an enhancement of child allowances, at a cost of 0.1 percent of GDP. All in all, the equivalent of 3/4 percent of GDP would be lost to the budget, about two thirds of it to the federal level, and the remainder to the Laender and local authorities. The authorities explained that they intended to contain the federal deficit to DM 60 billion (about 1 l/2 percent of GDP) in 1996, up from DM 50 billion in 1995. Abstracting from another takeover of extrabudgetary obligations (this time relating mainly to the pension liabilities of the railway), the federal deficit would remain roughly unchanged, and the tax losses would be fully offset by expenditure savings. If the lower levels of government continued to reduce their deficit, the general government deficit would then be kept to 2 percent of GDP, the l/2 point improvement relative to 1995 being due in equal parts (in the staff's estimation) to the economic cycle and to a further reduction in the structural deficit. Subsequent to the mission, a draft 1996 budget was approved by the Cabinet which does indeed affirm these targets, and whic:h would secure them mainly by means of personnel reductions, cuts in transport sector investment, and a number of restrictions on unemployment assistance. The staff welcomed the authorities' plans for 1996, and recognized in particular the magnitude of the adjustment effort on the expenditure side. All the same, in the staff's view, there was a case for going one step beyond the authorities' plans, to ensure no increase in the federal deficit; this would require additional measures totalling less than l/4 percent of GDP. An increase in the federal deficit would not send the right signals to other levels of government or to the public at large, and given the greater uncertainty surrounding consolidation at the lower levels of government, a stronger federal effort would help secure a general government deficit of 2 percent of GDP or less. Further clear progress on fiscal consolidation would be desirable in 1996 as long as robust growth materialized as projected by the staff and the auth0ritie.s. It would help ensure, to the benefit of both Germany and her ERM partners, that the time to raise interest rates would not come prematurely, and that when it did come the increases would not be unduly steep. Of course, should economic activity falter unexpectedly in 1996, it would then be appropriate to allow automatic stabilizers to work. The tax ~olicv agenda in the near term had effectively been set by the constitutional court rulings, though a government proposal to eliminate the business capital tax was also important. lJ To accommodate the Court's decision on income tax, the authorities had framed a proposal that would contain its cost and avoid a rise in the top marginal rates, by raising the marginal tax rate for inlcomes just above the subsistence level to lJ The business capital tax is levied on the book value of equity plus a portion of long-term debt, and is thus unrelated to profits.

The staff noted the dangers of poverty traps implicit in such high marginal rates, and to an even greater extent, in the case of social assistance recipients, in the withdrawal of benefits as earned income rises. Any action to alleviate these problems would be better funded through increases in indirect taxation, such as energy taxes or even VAT, than through any changes that would raise marginal tax rates for the upper income brackets. Indeed, from a medium-term perspective, the staff considered that a main priority should be to lower the top marginal income tax rates, as well as the corporate tax rate, both of which were still high by international standards. The authorities stated that, together with tax relief for families, these were indeed their priorities, once the explicitly temporary solidarity surcharge had been eliminated. 2. Monetary oolicv There was broad agreement between the staff and the authorities that recent monetary policy decisions and the present monetarv stance were appropriate. Monetary policy had been instrumental in fostering recovery without permitting a buildup of inflationary pressures, despite large swings in M3 growth and in long-term bond yields, which had rendered more difficult the interpretation of monetary conditions. To these difficulties had been added, in early 1995, the exchange market turmoil. The authorities were at pains to dispel any impression that their latest interest rate cut in March might have been intended to fight the appreciation of the deutsche mark. In their view, monetary policy should have a medium-term orientation and be solely targeted to the achievement of price stability; it could not be used to influence exchange rates. The March rate cut had been motivated instead by the weakness of monetary growth, and by the effect of the appreciation on domestic prices and monetary conditions. The staff welcomed the rate cut, agreeing that it did not pose a risk to price stability. It noted, though, that in most circumstances monetary policy does have an impact on the exchange rate, and that this impact should be taken into account in deciding on policy settings. In the staff's view, the March rate cut had been appropriate also in that it had helped to alleviate tensions in exchange markets in Europe, to the benefit of both Germany and the international community. Similarly, from both a domestic and an international perspective, there could be additional scope for lowering interest rates in coming months if the deutsche mark remained under upward pressure, inflation and monetary growth continued to be subdued, and the recovery weakened significantly. Looking further ahead, the stage would eventually be reached, as the recovery matured and spare capacity was reduced, in which monetary conditions would have to be tightened to keep inflationary pressures in check. It would not be easy to identify this point. The staff acknowledged that M3 would provide useful information in this regard, but stressed that 1/ See chapter III of the accompanying paper on Selected Background Issues. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - other indicators--including wages, prices, the exchange rate, and the yield curve--would need to be watched closely, in case M3 misbehaved again. The authorities explained that they remained firmly committed to their monetary framework, even though they ,continued to monitor and analyze a wide range of other indicators. 1J Much of the erratic behavior of M3 over the last several years could be traced to unification and to (not unrelated) tax changes, and the "perverse" strategy 'of early 1994 had been justified by special circumstances which had seriously distorted M3. The authorities were hopeful that greater short-run stability would return to M3 before too long, so much so that it should provide adequate warning if inflationary pressures began to mount already in 1'995. A pick-up in monetary growth, even if it was not sufficient to cause overshooting of the target range, would be watched carefully, and might prompt a reexamination of the extent to which undershooting earlier in the year may have reflected special factors. However, the authorities also recognized that the possibility that monetary growth would remain subdued and yet inflation would start to pick up could not be ruled out. While such a scenario would admittedly test the credibility of the monetary framework, decisive action would be taken to contain inflationary pressures. The authorities stressed that the key to maintaining policy credibility in the face of short-term instability in M3 lay in keeping the public informed of the reasons for monetary policy decisions. Complete predictability was neither feasible nor desirable, as it would make the central bank a hostage of the markets rather than a leader; but discretion had to be carefully explained ex post, Other suggestions for modifying the current framework would bring their own problems. A wider target range would make the message of monetary po:Licy less clear, and a medium-term target could serve as an excuse to delay action and thus eventually necessitate more pronounced changes in policy settings. The authorities reiterated their commitment to European monetary union. Important progress had already been made. Even in its early days, the European Monetary Institute had already strengthened cooperation between central banks; technical preparations for monetary union were well underway; and most importantly, Europe was developing a common "culture of stability". While hopes of monetary union in 1997 had been virtually abandoned, 1999 was a feasible target. In the authorities' view, however, convergence was crucial, and far more important than specific dates. It was the key both to greater exchange rate stability in the years immediately ahead and to the final stage of monetary union. Germany was committed to a strict interpretation and application of the convergence criteria. In a similar vein, the German authorities were looking for a strengthening of the sanctions provided for fiscal misbehavior in the final stage.

Structural issues The authorities were continuing their efforts--many under the heading of the 1993 Standort report on securing Germany's economic future--to make the economy more flexible. They pointed in particular to privatization and derezulation, and the staff recognized the progress made in these respects. In addition to the outstanding record of the now-defunct Treuhand in eastern Germany, many smaller and more conventional privatizations had taken place over the past decade in western Germany, and important ones in the near future would include the airline Lufthansa as well as a very large equity flotation by the telecommunications company. In the area of deregulation, the authorities were hoping to shorten the current very long waits for investment approvals by giving investors the option of proceeding on the basis of a set of essential approvals, with supplementary ones following later. There had also been important reforms in German financial markets. The Second Financial Markets Promotion Law had come into effect in the second half of 1994. The new Federal Securities Supervisory Office and new insider trading restrictions and disclosure requirements would bring German securities markets in line with international regulatory standards. 1/ Nonetheless, German corporate equity and bond markets remained under- developed by international standards, owing in part to the prevalence of small and medium-sized firms, the dominance of universal banks, and the retention of pension funds by employers- -deep-seated structural factors which were unlikely to change quickly. The staff welcomed recent changes, but noted that as these took hold and their effects were assessed, further initiatives might be warranted, in particular to strengthen competition in the banking system, increase the liquidity of securities markets, and improve the transparency and openness of corporate finance. There had been remarkable achievements in eastern Germany, but great challenges remained- -challenges with important implications for the major problems now confronting Germany as a whole, in the fiscal and labor market areas. The competitiveness of east German products was beginning to improve, but in most enterprises labor costs were still too high by comparison with productivity, and economic development remained unduly dependent on costly subsidies. The staff welcomed, as a step in the right direction, the authorities' proposals to reduce these subsidies with effect from 1997. A further concern was that growth had been accompanied by little net job creation, although east German firms were continuing to find ways around collective wage agreements that they could not afford, thus mitigating slightly the dampening effect on employment of wage convergence. Indeed, unemolovment, not only in the east but also in the west, had become Germany's most pressing problem. To be sure, even all-German 1/ See chapter I of the accompanying paper on Selected Background Issues. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - unemployment remained relatively low by European standards; but it was still unacceptably high. Moreover, the staff noted that unemployment had been at least as persistent in Germany as elsewhere, with worrisome consequences both for the new Laender and, more generally, for the period beyond the peak of the current cycle. 1/ Aside from depressing incomes and imposing great personal hardship, unemployment also presented dangers for financial stability, as it could easily lead to pressures on monetary and especially fiscal policy. The authorities and the staff agreed that the 1995 wage round had been disappointing. The wage settlements were not particularly inflationary, but--unlike in 1994--neither were they helpful to employment. What was still more worrying was that last year's ground-breaking agreements permitting increased flexibility in working practices and greater wage differentiation had not spawned a trend. All in all, the wage round had been conducted at the expense of the unemployed, and last year's restraint and innovations now looked like a recession-induced aberration. The authorities thus conceded that the scenario they had hoped for last year, whereby unemployment would be gradually resorbed as wages persistently rose less fast than productivity, was looking increasingly improbable. They pinned their hopes instead on three other strands of their strategy. First, laws passed last year as part of the Standort project would make the labor market less rigid. Notably, working time had been made more flexible, and private employment intermediation had been permitted. Second, even more emphasis would be put on active labor market policies, including some innovative new programs, to help the long-term unemployed stay in touch with the labor market. u Third, efforts would be made to improve incentives to work. The Government had proposed a limit of two years on the (currently indefinite) duration of unemployment assistance. u In addition, a reform of social assistance was in preparation, with a view to strengthening incentives to take up employment. The staff agreed that these various initiatives would no doubt help. It considered the curtailment of the duration of unemployment assistance to be crucial in this regard. But still more difficult decisions would probably be needed. At lthe heart of (Germany's unemployment problem lay relatively generous social benefits, -which conspired with the centralized bargaining system to prevent downward flexibility of wages and to exclude the low-skilled--including those whose skills have been devalued by structural change--from the labor market. &/ Of course, each nation had to decide for itself how much, if any, of its social objectives it was lJ See Chapter II of the accompanying paper on Selected Background Issues. 2J New programs include the establishment of employment agencies that would place long-term unemployed persons in temporary positions--see the accompanying paper on Recent Economic Developments. 3 "Unemployment benefit" proper is payable for one year, and (somewhat lower) "unemployment assistance" indefinitely thereafter. 4J See SM/94/213, Chapter V, for a detailed discussion. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - willing to sacrifice for the sake of lower unemployment. It was important, however, to face up to this trade-off, in the course of the forthcoming reexamination of social assistance, and more generally. If Germany was serious about reducing unemployment, there was little alternative to targeting social assistance toward the truly needy, reducing the taxation of labor (including social security contributions) with correspondingly lower social benefits, and widening the wage structure. In addition, restrictive rules on dismissals, which act as barriers to hiring, needed to be reexamined, and the gradual expansion of judicial discretion in this area reined in. Subsequent to the mission, the Government's proposal to curtail the duration of unemployment assistance was rejected by the Parliament and effectively abandoned. Instead, the Government announced plans to base unemployment assistance on potential, rather than past, earnings--a link which may prove difficult to implement, and which indeed already exists in law but without so far being enforced. 4. Trade and aid policies The authorities reiterated their commitment--exercised within the framework of the European Union- -to a liberal trading policy. Germany had welcomed the reductions of trade barriers secured in the Uruguay Round, and the overall strengthening of the multilateral trading system. Services (especially financial services, maritime transport, and telecommunications) now ranked high on the multilateral trade policy agenda, and Germany hoped that an agreement in this area would be reached this year. Closer to home, the EU had, over the last year and with Germany's support, made some further moves toward liberalizing trade in sensitive products (steel, textiles, agricultural products) with Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) and the former Soviet Union. Germany remained a strong supporter of rapid integration of CEECs into the EU, despite the fact that the costs of such a move--as yet unquantified- -might necessitate radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and other programs. Germany's official development assistance (ODA) amounted to 0.33 percent of GDP in 1994, down from 0.40 percent of GDP in 1991. Germany continued in addition to provide generous financial assistance to economies in transition- -in 1994, roughly equivalent to the amount of ODA. V. Staff Aooraisal In most areas, Germany's economic achievements over the past year can only be described as impressive. Inflation has been tamed, the economic recovery has strengthened, and despite the continuing heavy burden of financing reconstruction in the new states, Germany has made more progress in resolving financial imbalances than most other industrial countries. But further tough decisions on public expenditures will be needed over the next few years if the high tax burden is to be reduced, as it should be, without undermining fiscal consolidation. And crucially, sooner or later--and the staff would hope sooner--the social partners and the authorities will have to come to grips with the unemployment problem. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - The recent appreciation of the deutsche mark has raised concerns about competitiveness, and questions as to whether policy action should be attempted to moderate or reverse it. As in the past, the authorities have left the exchange rate to be determined largely by the market, using public statements and infrequent interventions to influence it, while orienting monetary and fiscal policy toward domestic stability. The staff believes that this strategy is appropriate. This being said, the staff shares the view that the deutsche mark is now somewhat overvalued, and that maintenance of the current exchange rate would hinder a return to a more balanced external current account position. Notwithstanding the effects of the appreciation, the period ahead should be a propitious one for the needed further adjustments of policy, and fiscal consolidation should take maximum advantage of it. The staff considers the strategy envisaged by the authorities to be broadly appropriate: it would provide for parallel reductions in the general government deficit and in the high burden of taxes and social security contributions, to reach a general government deficit of 1 percent of GDP and a ratio of public expenditures to GDP of 46 percent by the year 2000. Nonetheless, somewhat more ambitious objectives would be preferable. In the remainder of this decade, it is essential that a basis be laid--in the form of very low deficits, a :reduced public debt, and a lower tax burden--to prepare in particular for the prospective ageing of the German population, and the threat of sharply rising social security costs beyond the turn of the century. In addition, further fiscal consolidation would contribute to domestic and world saving, thereby enhancing the availability of capital at home and abroad. The fiscal strategy will be tested in 1996, when sizable tax cuts, mandated by the Constitutional Court, are to be introduced. In the draft budget approved by the Cabinet, the widening of the federal deficit is to be kept to l/4 percent of GDP. While this budget already embodies considerable expenditure restraint, it would have been desirable, in the staff's view, for the tax cuts to be absorbed without an increase in the federal deficit, in order to reduce the general government deficit to below 2 percent of GDP. Beyond 1996, a further concern is that the expenditure savings which are likely to prove most easily attainable-- those in the areas of public consumption and investment- -will not be sufficient to achieve the twin aims of a sizable reduction of government levies and a very low budget deficit. It will thus be important to achieve political consensus for expenditure restraint in more sensitive areas such as subsidies and social programs. The primacy of deficit containment means that any failure to reach such a consensus should be reflected in a deferment of further tax cuts. Monetary policy too has scored important successes, despite large swings in monetary growth. The exchange market turmoil of early 1995 posed further challenges. The staff believes that the cut in short-term official interest rates implemented at that time was appropriate both from the perspective of domestic monetary conditions and from an international point of view, as it helped alleviate tensions in exchange markets within Europe. Similarly, there could be additional scope for interest rate cuts in coming Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - months should the deutsche mark remain under upward pressure, monetary growth and inflation remain subdued, and the recovery weaken. Looking further ahead, it is to be expected that, as the recovery matures, the stage will eventually be reached in which monetary conditions will have to be tightened to prevent a resurgence of inflationary pressures. In this regard, the behavior of M3 may provide useful clues, but the short- term instability this aggregate has exhibited in recent years may persist, and continued pragmatism will be required in the management of monetary policy. In particular, the authorities will need to continue to watch closely a range of indicators other than M3, including wage and price developments and the exchange rate. The authorities have made commendable progress in addressing a number of structural rigidities in the economy. But much less has been done to tackle the roots of Germany's most severe problem, unemployment. The 1995 wage round suggests that insiders will take advantage of the economic upturn to secure better conditions for themselves, with little regard for their unemployed colleagues. Ultimately, it will be important to face up to the difficult trade-offs between generous social protection and unemployment. It is particularly worrying that the proposed two-year limit on unemployment assistance has effectively been scrapped. Such a measure is very much needed. The proposed reexamination of social assistance is a necessary further step. But it is crucial that the forthcoming debate on these issues combine innovative thinking with a healthy disrespect for "sacred cows." Sensitive options such as enhanced targeting of social benefits, reductions in their overall generosity, and greater wage differentiation should not be rejected out of hand. Only thus will Germany be able to come to an informed consensus on how much unemployment it is willing to shoulder. Germany's leadership role in the EU confers upon her important responsibilities with regard to the maintenance and strengthening of a liberal international trading system. The staff hopes that she will use this role to press for greater openness toward the EU's neighbors as well as further afield. Last but not least, Germany should be commended for its generous assistance to economies in transition, but should also be encouraged to raise its aid to low-income developing countries toward the UN target of 0.7 percent of GDP. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Germany be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The staff's scenario closely resembles that of the authorities through 1996 because it incorporates the 1996 tax and budget proposals and is based on similar assumptions about the macroeconomic environment. Thereafter, the staff assumes the following for the territorial authorities: 2/ 0 A unitary tax elasticity with respect to nominal GDP and no tax cuts beyond those scheduled for 1996; l No growth in public investment and public procurement in real terms; 0 Cuts in public employment of 1 percent a year, in line with plans to scale back federal employment levels and to bring staffing levels in the new Laender more into line with west German norms; 0 Increases in public sector wages in line with those assumed for the private sector; 0 Growth in noncyclical public transfers in line with that of potential GDP; 0 Government bond yields remaining close to current levels. In the staff's scenario, the deficit of the territorial authorities declines to 1 l/2 percent of GDP by 1999 from about 3 percent of GDP in 1995-96 (Table II-l). A large part of the decline would represent a cyclical improvement as the economy is projected to grow slightly faster than its longer-term potential in the next few years. The remainder would reflect the effects of the expenditure assumptions, which help limit the u The scenario presented here differs from that in the World Economic Outlook exercise in which noncyclical expenditures are assumed to grow broadly in line with potential GDP. 2J The territorial authorities comprise the federal government, the Laender, the local authorities, and a number of special funds, including the one recently set up to service the inherited debt of the Treuhand and of other public sector institutions.

By contrast, the official objective is to contain expenditure growth to below 3 percent a year, or to only about l/2 percent a year in real terms. u According to the authorities' estimates, this would permit the deficit of the territorial authorities to fall to l/2 percent of GDP in 1999 if there were no further tax cuts (Table 11-2). At the general government level, fiscal projections also depend on the performance of the social security funds, the collective expenditure of which exceeds 20 percent of GDP. 2/ In the medium-term, the staff assumes that the social security funds will run a small surplus in keeping with their requirement to maintain a financial reserve sufficient to cover a fixed number of months of benefits. As a result, the general government deficit would be lower than that of the territorial authorities alone, and would fall to about 1 percent of GDP in 1999. The official projection assumes the general government accounts would have reached balance by 1999, implying room for further tax cuts. The staff would also estimate that a growing number of pensioners (the number aged 60 years and over is expected to grow by about 2 percent a year in the period 1992-2000) will, under current institutional arrangements, put pressure on the expenditures of the social security funds. Thus, even though the staff projects (on the assumption of falling unemployment) little real growth in Federal Labor Office expenditures, overall expenditures of the social security funds would grow slightly faster than nominal GDP in the medium term. Correspondingly, average contribution rates would have to rise to maintain the social security funds in surplus. u In the official medium-term projection, inflation settles at around 2 l/2 percent a year. 2J Data for the social security funds and general government sectors in Tables II-1 and II-2 are on a national accounts basis, whereas the data for the territorial authorities are on an administrative basis. In recent years, the deficit of the territorial authorities on an administrative basis has been significantly larger than the deficit on a national accounts basis in large part because of net lending (especially through the European Recovery Program), which is classified as expenditure in the administrative accounts.
