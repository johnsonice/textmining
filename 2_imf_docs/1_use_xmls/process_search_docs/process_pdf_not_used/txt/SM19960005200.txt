Introduction and Summary of Issues The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney during December 5-l 8, 1995.’ The staff team met with Treasurer Willis, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Fraser, Treasury Secretary Evans, and representatives of other government departments, the Industry Commission, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), financial institutions, and the Business Council. Australia has accepted the obliga- tions of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The discussions were held against the backdrop of upcoming national elections, which have been called for March 2, 1996. Prime Minister Keating’s Labour Party has controlled the House of Representatives since 1983. Economic issues--especially the pace of medium- term fiscal consolidation and the future of the industrial relations system--have been at the center of the political debate. At the last Article IV consultation (on February 22, 1995)*--and in the context of a marked strengthening of the economy--Executive Directors cautioned the authorities to stand ready to contain the cyclically strong expansion of domestic demand and prevent the re-emer- gence of inflationary pressures. Over the medium term, and given Australia’s high level of external debt and a continuing weak external current account, Directors considered that a less risky strategy would be to finance a larger proportion of investment from domestic saving. Directors also emphasized the need to deepen and accelerate the structural reform program, especially in the labor market area, to sustain growth. Policy implementation since the last consultation has been broadly in line with Directors’ advice. However, with the recovery having entered a more mature phase, the key challenge is to sustain expansion while maintaining low inflation and reducing the current account deficit. Specifically, the key macroeconomic issues are: (i) the need to impart greater structural content and credibility to medium-term fiscal consolidation; and (ii) whether the current monetary policy stance is appropriate to achieve the inflation objective. The periodicity, timeliness, coverage, and quality of Australia’s economic data are fully adequate for effective surveillance (Appendix I). ‘Messrs.

Report on the Economic Situation and Strategy 1. The policy context Since the late 1980s in some important respects, the Australian economy has been in an evolutionary phase, driven by the increasing integration of Australia into the global eco- nomy through the decline in tariff protection and far-reaching financial deregulation.3 At issue has been how best the authorities could foster this adjustment, with the obstacles greatest in the labor market where, historically, extensive regulation coexisted with high levels of external protection in a mutually reinforcing way. At the start of this decade, the adjustment looked quite difficult and economic prospects uncertain. In 1990/91, the domestic economy was in recession with the unemployment rate approaching 11 percent. In addition, inflation had averaged a relatively high 8-9 percent during the second half of the 198Os, and credibility in its reduction was low. Against this background, Australia’s basic economic challenge in recent years has been to raise growth sufficiently to lower unemployment closer to the official target of 5 percent, while locking in a low inflation environment and avoiding pressure on the external current account. The principal constraints to addressing this challenge have, in turn, been two-fold. First, the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) has continued to exceed the targeted unemploy- ment rate. This has meant that wage and price pressures have typically developed with unemployment well in excess of the target. Continuing rigidities in the industrial relations system and,inadequate labor force skills have been the main underlying causes, preventing the economy from adjusting fully to the structural changes that have taken place since the late 1980s. Indeed, the NAIRU is estimated to have increased from about 6% percent to the 7X-8 percent range since the late 1980s.4 The second constraint has been a structural deterioration in the external position. Thus, the current account deficit widened from 2% percent of GDP, on average, during the 1960s and 197Os, to about 4% percent of GDP in the last decade (Chart 1). With rather more reliance on debt-creating flows, net external debt has risen from 5% percent of GDP in the late 1970s to close to 40 percent recently--high by industrial country standards--of which about two thirds is of the nonofficial sector (Box 1). At play here has been the secular decline in 3See The Deregulation of Financial Intermediaries, Reserve Bank of Australia, 199 1, for details and analysis of financial deregulation in Australia. 4The staff team has not independently estimated the NAIRU. Academic and official estimates--including by the OECD--have a wide range, but most of these estimates suggest that it has crept up since the late 1980s. This increase has been attributed partly to hysteresis effects--the share of the long-term unemployed remains over a third--and partly to the ratio- nalization of public sector employment that has been under way in this period.

Australia: Capital Flows-A Brief Perspective Although the current account deficit has widened since the early 199Os, the external debt ratio has broadly stabilized, reflecting a change in the composition of capital i&lows: . During the 198Os, net capital flows were dominated by large net debt inflows, reflecting the elimination of exchange and capital controls and increased gearing of the corporate sector. Gross equity i&lows--mainly in the form of direct investment--were also significant, but these were largely offset by direct investment outflows. . During the 199Os, the composition of capital flows has been more evenly balanced, with debt and equity each accounting for about half of the total net inflows. . As a result, Australia’s net foreign debt (borrowing minus lending, including international reserves), which had risen from 6 percent to 35% percent of GDP over the course of the 198Os, peaked at 4 1% percent in 1992193, and has since declined slightly. . The currency composition of external debt has changed significantly over the past decade, as the development of the Australian dollar Euromarket contributed to a decline in the share of debt denominated in U.S. dollars and other major foreign currencies (except Japanese yen). Within these broad trends, the composition of capital inflows has been quite volatile in recent years. In the early 199Os, state governments accounted for a large share of external borrowing, reflecting the weakness of their fiscal positions and their newly acquired ability to borrow directly on their own account. Indeed, nonofficial net debt intlows were negative in the early 199Os, as corporations sought to strengthen their balance sheets. Most recently, there has been some reversal of these trends as state government finances have improved and the corporate sector has carried forward the process of balance sheet restructuring. Equity flows have been characterized by fairly strong and stable gross &lows of foreign direct investment (averaging 1% percent of GDP), a generally lower level of direct investment outflows than in the 198Os, and volatility (with a sharp upward spike in 1993/94) in net portfolio inflows. The United States and Japan remain the largest sources of Australia’s equity inflows (Australia is Japan’s third largest direct investment destination, after the United States and China). Further details of long-term trends and recent developments in capital flows are contained in the background paper on Recent Economic Developments. the national savings rate, which has been considerably faster than that experienced in the OECD as a whole (Chart 2). While private saving has declined somewhat, the root cause has - been a decline in public sector saving. 2. The policy strategy In dealing with these constraints and addressing the basic economic challenge, the Government has been developing a comprehensive policy strategy based on three main elements: raising national savings, locking in a low inflation environment, and enhancing flexibility in product and factor markets. The stratem to raise national saving focuses on the public sector. Since hitting a cyclical peak at 43/4 percent of GDP in 1991/92, the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) has improved slowly to under 2 percent of GDP in 1994/95.

The Commonwealth budget position remained in a deficit of 2X-3% percent of GDP between 1992/93-1994/95, despite the strong cyclical improvement in economic conditions. Consequently, the Government committed, in the context of the 1995/96 budget, to bring the budget to broad balance in the current fiscal year--implying an adjustment equivalent to about 2% percent of GDP--and projected a surplus of over 1 percent of GDP by 1998/99.’ However, much of the projected near-term improvement in the budget position reflects asset sales and other one-off factors, with most of the structural tightening left to the outer years, Overall, with the state government and public enterprise sectors expected to maintain the recent improvement in their financial performance, the strategy envisages an increase in public saving from about 2’/4 percent of GDP in 1994/95 to 6 percent of GDP by 1998/99. While public saving is the main policy focus, the Government also believes there is scope to raise household saving, which has also been on a declining trend since the early 1970s. As well as providing an economic environment that encourages saving, growing emphasis has been given to expanding the scope of the superannuation (private retirement) system through compulsory employer and employee contributions, the latter introduced in the 1995/96 budget. By 2002, up to 15 percent of employees’ gross earnings will be contributed to superannuation saving.6 The strategy for locking in low inflation has involved a shift in the emphasis of monetary policy (without altering its legal framework)--from an eclectic approach aimed at multiple objectives, including price stability, full employment, and growth--to one aimed primarily at producing low inflation. Thus, in 1993, the Reserve Bank announced the objective of maintaining underlying inflation at a rate of 2 to 3 percent, on average, over the course of the business cycle. The Government subsequently endorsed the Reserve Bank’s policy, and the ACTU has formally agreed to seek wage outcomes consistent with this inflation performance. In support of this objective, and against the background of a sharp acceleration in domestic demand, the Reserve Bank tightened monetary conditions during the second half of 1994, raising the official cash interest rate in three steps from 4% percent in July to 7% percent in December. ‘Some slippage may already have occurred in the underlying budget position. Thus, in the midyear budget review, released after the departure of the team, the Government projected a slightly smaller surplus for 1995/96 ($A 115 million) than in the May budget ($A 718 million). Weaker revenue and higher expenditure, due to the weaker economic outlook, some addition- al expenditure decisions, and the blocking of some tax legislation in the Senate, were largely offset by a large (one-off> capital repayment ($A 1.9 billion) from the State of Victoria. ‘The background paper on Selected Issues for the Article IV consultation analyses the determinants of private saving in Australia and provides details of the Government’s superannuation policy.

Australia: Fiscal Consolidation in the Australian States Public fmances in Australia are characterized by large vertical imbalances, or differences in the relative taxing and spending powers of the Central (Commonwealth) Government and the states and territories. The Commonwealth Government raises about 70 percent of total public sector revenue through its virtual control over the income, sales, and excise tax bases, but accounts for only about 50 percent of total public sector expenditure. State governments are responsible for the bulk of public infrastructure support. To compensate for this vertical imbalance, intergovernmental grants from the Commonwealth are made and account for about 40 percent of state revenues, while grants from the Commonwealth and the states account for over 20 percent of local government revenues. In the early 199Os, with the onset of the recession, the fiscal position of the states deteriorated rapidly, as slower economic growth dampened revenues, and expenditure was slow to decline (partly because of the need to assist distressed state fmancial institutions). Since then, the states have brought about a significant turnaround in their financial situation. This was achieved through vigorously pursued fiscal consolidation strategies aimed at: lowering growth in current outlays; increasing own-source revenues (chiefly by raising tax rates on existing bases, although several new bases have been introduced); increasing public sector efficiency by exposing state utilities to competitive forces; significantly reducing the number of public employees; removing unnecessary regulatory impediments to the workings of their economies; and undertaking several large asset sales as a part of privatization programs. This fiscal conso- lidation has been successful in transforming the state sector from a traditional net user of national savings into a net provider of savings--the net financing requirement of the states (including state utilities) has rebounded from a deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 199 l/92 to a surplus since 1993194. These surpluses are the first to be achieved by the states for several decades. Among the catalysts to firming the states’ resolve for fiscal restraint were: cuts in Commonwealth grants since the mid- 1980s; the national recession of the early 1990s; and growing interstate and intema- tional competition, driven by the opening up of the Australian economy. More information on states’ finances is contained in the background paper on Selected Issues for the Article IV consultation. Crucial to the overall strategy have been policies to promote a more flexible and efficient labor market. Thus, the Government began in the late 1980s to gradually shift the focus of the industrial relations system away from centrally determined awards toward enter- prise-based bargaining.’ While enterprise bargaining is now intended to be the main avenue for employees to secure wage increases and for employers to secure more efficient labor practices, the award system has been maintained as a safety net for weaker segments of the work force. Other elements of the authorities’ approach have included active labor market policies such as temporary wage subsidies and hiring incentives to reduce long-term 7The history of the award system is discussed in an annex to Australia--Recent Economic Developments, N/94/17, l/l S/94.

Major initiatives are also under way in two other key policy areas to enhance medium- term growth prospects: (i) trade liberalization continues to be advanced through unilateral actions as well as multilateral negotiations, setting the pace for other parts of the overall strategy; and (ii) competition in previously sheltered areas of the economy--particularly government business enterprises and unincorporated businesses--is being promoted through the phased implementation of a national comoetition nolicy based on the far-reaching recommendations of the Hilmer Report. 3. The response of the economy The Government’s policy strategy has helped steer Australia in the right direction, and recent macroeconomic performance has been more favorable than in many other industrial countries. In particular, real GDP has risen by over 16 percent since mid- 199 1, with growth peaking at 6 percent in the year to September 1994 (Table 2 and Chart 4). The expansion has been driven by robust growth in private consumption and, since the second half of 1993, a very strong rebound in business fixed investment, reflecting improvements in corporate balance sheet positions, higher rates of capacity utilization, and strong consumer spending. Over the past year, the pace of activity has moderated (to 3.3 percent in the year to September 1995) owing, at least in part, to the tightening of monetary policy in the second half of 1994. The establishment and maintenance of low inflation has been a major policy achieve- ment in the 1990s. After exceeding the OECD average throughout most of the 1970s and 198Os, inflation fell very rapidly during the last recession and remained low (on the order of 2 percent) from 1991192 through 1994/95 (Chart 5). In recent quarters, however, inflationary pressures have increased, with the “headline” inflation rate increasing to 5.1 percent in the year to December 1995. Although much of the increase in measured inflation can be attri- buted to the direct impact of higher interest rates, particularly mortgage rates, on the consumer price index (CPI), the Treasury’s measure of “underlying inflation,” which excludes the direct impact of interest rates, food prices, and other volatile components, has also picked up, reaching 3.2 percent in the year to December, the highest rate in almost five years. Important gains have been achieved on the emnloyment front. Between December 1992 and December 1995, total employment increased by 750,000, well above the target the Government had set for itself However, with strong gains also recorded in the participation ‘Under the Job Compact, one of the programs introduced in the May 1994 Working Nation statement, the Government provides a guaranteed job placement--usually in the private sector--for the long-term unemployed (more than 18 months). Wage subsidies are provided to employers for six to twelve months to induce them to hire persons who have been out of work for extended periods.

Progress has been particularly good in reducing long-term unemployment, which has declined to about a third of the total. Although the unemployment rate remains relatively high, strong employment growth has already put upward pressure on wages. In the year to August 1995, average weekly earnings rose by over 5 percent, up from about 3 percent a year earlier, and above the 4-5 per- cent growth rate the Reserve Bank has stated is consistent with its inflation objective. With labor productivity growth slowing, nonfarm unit labor costs, after declining by 1% percent in the year to September 1994, have recently picked up, increasing by 4% percent in the year to September 1995. Rapid growth in domestic demand has also been reflected in a growing external imbalance, with the current account deficit rising from 4 percent of GDP in 1992/93-1993/94 to a near-record 6 percent of GDP in 1994/95. Most of the deterioration occurred in the merchandise trade account, reflecting a strong increase in imports, particularly of capital goods (Table 3 and Chart 6). Although exports have recently been weak, this has been due to a drought-induced drop in rural exports; manufactured exports have remained remarkably strong in recent years, partly under the stimulus of a long-term decline in the real exchange rate (Chart 7). Revised near-term projections were released by the Government in December 1995 in conjunction with the midyear budget review. The team’s near-term projections are broadly consistent with these forecasts (Table 4). The outlook is for activity to slow to 3% percent (annual average) in 1995/96, underpinned by slower--but still healthy--grow&in private consumption (3% percent) and business fixed investment (8 percent). On the production side, output will benefit from a substantial recovery in farm output from last year’s drought. With a recovery in rural exports and continued strong performance of manufactured exports, the slower growth in domestic demand is expected to result in a decline in the current account deficit to about 4% percent of GDP. However, given the wage pressures already in the pipe- line, underlying inflation is projected to reach 3% percent during the year to June 1996, and unemployment is expected to remain at its current rate of about 8% percent. III. Report on the Policy Discussions The discussions focused on the basic policy strategy and whether modifications to it needed to be considered in light of the experience of its implementation. Although major new initiatives were unlikely to be introduced in the run-up to the general elections, the authorities agreed that this period afforded an important opportunity to consider how recent gains could be consolidated and implementation of their strategy better assured. The authorities also agreed on the importance of holding to the established policy course and avoiding any policy relaxation in the period immediately ahead.

Medium-term framework and fiscal policies The team welcomed the acceleration of the Commonwealth Government’s medium- term fiscal consolidation announced in the 1995/96 budget, noting that it would help reinforce the consolidation already achieved at the state government and PTE levels. Together with the measures to increase private saving, the plan could be expected to boost national saving from 17 percent of GDP in 1994/95 to around 2 1% percent by 1999/2000. The stafI’s medium- term scenario discussed with the authorities (and further detailed in Appendix II) suggests that this would allow investment to rise to a level (about 24% percent of GDP) consistent with maintaining growth on the order of 3-3’/4 percent, while also achieving a modest reduction in the external debt ratio. The team agreed that delivering on the envisaged consolidation is now the priority for policy, and discussions focused on three areas. First, the process of consolidation at the Commonwealth level has only just begun and--abstracting from asset sales and other one-off factors that importantly shape the expected outturn in 1995/96--it is only in 1996/97 that the Commonwealth budget position is expected to move into small surplus (Table 5). Consequently, the team observed that any slippage at this early stage would be costly for the credibility of the overall strategy, and would imply a need for an even tighter monetary policy than otherwise, with implications for investment and consumer confidence. Second, the team asked whether there was scope for more firmly--and visibly-- anchoring the Government’s commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation, including through the public announcement of clearly stated medium-term budget objectives, observing this could have up-front beneficial effects on market confidence. In this context, the stti noted that the projected improvement in the fiscal position over the medium term was intended to result from existing policies, with no provision for new or contingent revenue measures or expenditure initiatives. The team saw risks to the plan from its stringent reliance on no net new policy initiatives; this would require, for example, that temporarily-legislated spending programs (such as the Working Nation initiatives) not be renewed or replaced when their funding period expired. Indeed, the task could get even more demanding were growth to be slower than anticipated, and the significant projected expenditure savings from unemploy- ment reduction to remain elusive. Thus, the team considered, it would help anchor the fiscal plan more securely, as well as provide a cushion against risks to the outlook--including uncertainties about the extent of Ricardian offsets in private saving--if the envisaged adjustment were based on neti structural measures. A number of such fiscal reform measures--affecting both revenues and expendi- tures--had been discussed in the context of previous consultations. For example, with social welfare spending projected to stay still relatively high over the medium term, the generosity of some programs could be reviewed--particularly those that may be impairing private incentives to work and save (e.g., unemployment and universal pension benefits), involve transfers to middle- and upper-income groups (e.g., family allowances), or where greater cost recovery might be feasible (e.g., medical care). On the tax side, efficiency considerations had long favored the introduction of a broadly-based consumption tax that could also help redress Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - Table 5.

Consideration could also be given to reducing the tax concessions to superannuation, which have become less relevant with the introduction of compulsory contributions. Indeed, the team observed, progress in these areas of fiscal reform could create room for the overall fiscal effort to be even more ambitious in scope, helping carry national saving closer to the levels achieved in the 197Os, and adapting the fiscal structure more closely to the requirements of a highly competitive economy. The team urged that the possibility of further fiscal consolidation be explored as the authorities come to revisit the medium-term outlook in the context of the next budget. More ambitious fiscal consolidation would provide a better basis for raising the rate of sustainable growth and achieving the unemployment target, while also allowing some reduction in the external debt ratio. The authorities were in broad agreement with the team’s emphasis on ways to strengthen the prospects for fiscal consolidation, and said that the present plan would certainly be reviewed in the context of the next budget. Meanwhile, they reiterated their confidence-- despite slightly weaker-than-originally expected growth and the Senate’s failure to enact certain revenue measures--that the budget deficit would be eliminated in the current fiscal year. They were similarly confident that significant surpluses could be achieved over the medium term. They noted that it is already the Government’s practice to offset new or renewed expenditure programs with cuts in other areas. They also pointed out that most social welfare benefits, including the old-age pension, unemployment benefits, and family Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - payments, are subject to income and asset tests. On tax policy, they observed that, unlike the situation a few years ago, none of the major political parties currently endorses the intro- duction of a consumption tax in the near term. As regards the adoption of more formal medium-term fiscal objectives, the authorities noted that they were seriously considering the introduction of new fiscal responsibility legislation to enhance the transparency and account- ability of fiscal policy. 2. Locking in low inflation: Monetary and exchange rate policies The discussions on monetary policy focused on two broad issues: (i) the policy response to the recent rise in underlying inflation; and (ii) whether there was room to further hone the monetary policy framework and better anchor anti-inflation credibility. On the inflation outlook, the authorities acknowledged that judgments on the implications for the monetary policy stance were finely balanced. Although underlying inflation was likely to rise somewhat further in the next couple of quarters, they were confident that it would fall back within the 2-3 percent band during 1996/97. In particular, they believed that the slowdown in demand and the social consensus in favor of low inflation would facilitate the achievement of their inflation objective. Accordingly, the authorities believed that the present monetary policy settings were broadly appropriate, although there had been expectations of some easing, given the slowing of the economy. With indicators sending mixed signals, the team agreed that the task for monetary policy was a complex one. Nevertheless, the team considered that the balance of risks remained on the up side. Notwithstanding the recent deceleration in demand andthe still-high level of unemployment, staff work suggested that the economy has been operating close to potential--at least in terms of the speed with which unemployment can be absorbed--with the margin of error more likely to be on the upside (i.e., that output is above potential) than on the downside (Box 3). Economic fundamentals--especially business profits and external demand--continue to be strong, and inflation expectations from consumer surveys remain above 4 percent (Chart 8). These concerns were reinforced by the recent acceleration in wage settlements to rates which, if maintained, the authorities acknowledged, would be inconsistent with achievement of the inflation objective. In these circumstances, and keeping in mind that the authorities’ resolve to adhere to the new framework was now being tested for the first time, the team suggested that a modest tightening of monetary policy could provide a timely indication of the commitment to lock in low inflation, without significant risk of pushing the economy into recession. This response would be fully consistent with the appropriately forward-looking nature of the monetary policy framework; it would also avoid possible costly implications of potential asymmetries in the inflation/output relationship, if growth were to turn out to be stronger than the authorities currently expect. While assuring the staff team that they would keep the issue under continuous review, the authorities agreed that, at minimum, the situation argued for holding the line on financial policies in the period immediately ahead.

Australia: The Output Gap and Medium-Term Potential Output In the background paper on Selected Issues for the Article IV consultation, the team has reviewed a range of estimates of potential output (and the implied output gaps) to assess the current cyclical position of the Australian economy and to evaluate the medium-term sustainable growth rate of the economy. Of course, there are clear limitations to the approach, which need to be carefully considered in reaching definitive conclusions. For example, potential output is a concept that relates to the full utilization of available resources and, as such, it cannot be directly measured or observed. Also, potential output is not a constant, but will vary over time depending on the size and efficiency of use of the capital stock and the labor resources of the economy. Nevertheless, the approach can yield interesting information as a leading indicator of capacity utilization, the cyclical position of the economy, and emerging inflationary pressures (see World Economic Outlook, October 1994, page 44, for a further explanation of the approach). The approach has yielded the following conclusions: 1. On the basis of both trend-fitting techniques and the production function approach, it would appear that the output gap that had opened up during the recession in 199019 1 was closed during the first half of 1994 and, since then, the Australian economy has been operating at or above capacity. Specifically, the strong growth in output in the second half of 1994, which continued, albeit at a somewhat slower pace in the first half of 1995, resulted in the opening of a significant negative gap toward the end of 1995. This is in contrast to the situation in most major industrial countries. 2. Further work on the empirical relation between the output gap estimates and inflation (on the basis of Granger-causality tests) points to the output gap estimates having some leading indicator properties for inflation, especially the headline measure of inflation. 3. Estimates of the production function can also be used to assess the growth potential over the medium term. On the basis of staff projections for growth in the labor force, the rate of capital accumulation, and productivity growth, these estimates suggest that the economy’s potential growth is somewhere around 3-3% percent per annum. However, this conclusion is subject, as outlined above, to a significant margin of uncertainty. In particular, the approach may not fully capture ongoing reforms in industrial relations, trade, and competition policies--although the approach has allowed for a structural rise in productivity, relative to the recent past, to reflect the impact of these reforms. The authorities tend to hold the view that, for these reasons, potential growth could be somewhat higher. On the monetary policy framework itself, the team agreed that its adoption had been a major step toward enhancing transparency, focussing expectations, and better honing policy formation. In light of experience, as well as that of some other countries that had adopted an even more demanding framework, the team engaged the authorities in a dialogue on whether there was room to better anchor anti-inflation credibility. In particular, the team asked whether the formulation of the inflation objective--as an average over a cycle--did enough to anchor short-run expectations, especially at present, with an extended period of inflation above the range in prospect. Clearly, the most important single factor in cementing credibility would be to bring underlying inflation back within the objective range as quickly as possible. The authorities said they were satisfied with the existing monetary policy framework and expressed confidence that maintaining inflation on the order of 2-3 percent, on average, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - CHART 8 AUSTRALIA SELECTED MONETARY INDICATORS, 1986/87-1995/96 2o I NOMINAL INTEREST RATES (In percent) IO-year government bond yield 8- 6- 4 ‘~~..~...~..‘~~~~cyVVI~~~~~~~.~~~’~.~~..~...~’~~.~~...~~~’.~~.~..~~r.l~.~.~~.~~.~~.~..~.~...’..~~~~~~~~~‘~~~~. 4 86f8l 87t88 88m 89Bo 90/91 91m 92l93 93194 w95 951% 14 I 14 INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AND REAL INTEREST FUTE INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AND REAL INTEREST FUTE l2 l2 (In percent) (In percent) 10 -- 10 -- Consumers’ Consumers’ inflationary infationq expectations expectations 8- 8- -8 -8 6- 6- -6 -6 .:*‘-. .:*‘-. ‘*.* ‘*.* .i .i 4 - . -0 /* 4 - . -0 ._._ /* ‘.... ._._ ‘....

They emphasized that they viewed the inflation objective as a “central tendency” rather than a range. Given the large supply shocks experienced by Australia, they believed that pursuing a lower, narrower, more rigid inflation objective as in New Zealand, would be potentially destabilizing, with adverse consequences for average growth over the cycle. In this connection, they noted that no country had been able to contain inflation within a very narrow band for an extended period of time, and that pledging to do so could, in fact, be damaging to credibility. They also expressed the view that financial stability had been enhanced by the policy of announcing--and infrequently changing--the desired level of short-term interest rates. However, they agreed that, at the present time, there could be room to better anchor short-term expectations, and periodic commentaries on the short-term outlook by the Governor of the Reserve Bank--while stopping short of inflation forecasts--were designed to this end. On the related issue of central bank independence, both the Government and the Reserve Bank believed that existing arrangements struck the right balance. The authorities agreed that success in maintaining a low inflation environment had clear--and beneficial--implications for Australia’s floating exchange rate regime. Periods of short-run exchange rate volatility in the past had been associated with concerns over the Government’s commitment to raising national saving and maintaining low inflation. On the exchange rate regime, itself, the authorities continued to hold the view that it was functioning well, helping the economy adjust to relatively large terms-of-trade shocks. With a strategy for raising national saving under way, the authorities did not expect that the process of reducing the current account deficit would require a decline in the real exchange rate. Indeed, the continued strong performance of exports of manufactured products and services suggested that competitiveness was not a problem. The Reserve Bank stated that it remained prepared to intervene in the foreign exchange market, forcefUlly if necessary, to maintain orderly market conditions. In practice, however, the need to do so was infrequent, the last occasion occurring more than two years ago. 3. Structural policies for raising productivity growth The authorities agreed that securing strong, noninflationary growth and a lasting reduction in unemployment were crucially dependent upon the further restructuring of Australia’s economy, programs for which are in different stages of implementation. a. Labor market policies Although the overall strategy to reform the labor market is still unfolding, the authorities believed that some important achievements were already at hand. Long-term unemployment has declined relatively rapidly over the past 18 months; manufacturing produc- tivity growth had been strong through 1994195; decentralized enterprise bargaining has further taken root, with more than half of all workers in the federal award system now covered by formal enterprise agreements; and “enterprise flexibility agreements” (EFAs) have been intro- duced, extending enterprise bargaining to the nonunionized sector. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-27- While endorsing the thrust of the reforms and agreeing that some considerable distance had already been traveled in their implementation, the team observed that the unemployment rate was still uncomfortably above the authorities’ objective and wage pressures were already increasing. This suggested that significant rigidities remained and that core elements of the reform agenda were still ahead. The latter included, in the team’s view, further streamlining the still complex award structure and minimizing procedural requirements so that they are less constraining of enterprise bargaining; the “no disadvantage” test--intended to ensure that workers are not made worse off by an enterprise agreement--was one of the key restraints. Partly for these reasons, the spread of bargaining in the nonunion sector has been particularly slow with fewer than 100 EFAs so far concluded. A further area of concern was the recent acceleration in wage settlements during a period when productivity growth had slowed, and the potential for wage growth to continue at a rate inconsistent with the inflation objective.g Overall, the team’s concern was that, without forward movement in the reforms, the risk remained for losing some control over aggregate wage outcomes while not reaping the full benefits of a more deregulated economy. In contrast to the more radical pace of labor market reforms elsewhere, the authorities emphasized their desire to move forward with the reforms while maintaining a social consensus in the form of the accord with the unions. While this might slow the pace of reform, they believed it would make for a more socially acceptable-- and ultimately more durable--reform process. b. Competition policies and privatization The authorities considered that the successful conclusion in April 1995 of negotiations between the Commonwealth and the states, aimed at extending the reach of competition policy to public enterprise and other previously sheltered sectors of the economy, was a policy milestone with benefits potentially fully as significant as those ushered in by the trade reforms. Although implementation would be in the hands of the states, compensation payments by the Commonwealth would help adherence to the established timetables; ultimately, peer pressure among the states and the carrot of increased activity would be expected to keep the reforms on schedule. The new initiatives were spearheaded by the Competition Policy Reform Act of 1995, which established two institutions--the Australian Competition and Consumer Commis- sion and the National Competition Council--to oversee implementation. The aim is to complete the structural reform of public monopolies by 2000. The reforms will facilitate competition between the public and private sectors in these traditional monopoly areas by granting third-party access to public infrastructure facilities and ensuring competitive neutrality between public and private sector businesses. In addition, a number of related, industry-specific reforms, notably in electricity, gas, water, and telecommunications were currently being implemented by the Commonwealth and state governments.” %rdeed, with some recent wage settlements focused on “headline” inflation performance, the potential for inconsistency with the underlying inflation objective clearly exists. ‘ODetails are provided in the background paper on Recent Economic Developments. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-28 - Further progress had also been made in the area of privatization. At the Common- wealth level, the Government sold its remaining 75 percent stake in Qantas Airways by public share offer in July 1995; and plans have been announced to sell its remaining majority stake in the Commonwealth Bank and to lease to the private sector the operation of federally owned airports. However, plans to privatize the national shipping line (ANL) were put on hold in November 1995, when the Government failed to obtain union agreement on modifications to work rules. There have also been a growing number of privatizations at state level; Victoria has been in the forefront with an aggressive privatization program that now includes the electricity sector. C. Trade policy Trade liberalization is already considerably advanced, and Australia is a leading advocate of such reform in the region. Tariffs on most products will be reduced to no more than 5 percent by mid-1996, although in the more sensitive industries (motor vehicles and textiles, clothing, and footwear) where protection is being reduced more slowly, the objective is to reduce tariffs to a range of 15-25 percent by 2000. The arrangements to apply to these industries beyond 2000 will be reviewed in 1996, with decisions announced in 1997. Australia has been active in a number of regional initiatives aimed at the liberalization of trade and investment flows (the APEC initiative), and has also been pursuing progressively more liberal bilateral trade relations with New Zealand. Details on these initiatives are contained in Appendix III. 4. Other issues Oficial development assistance (ODA) has been equivalent to about 0.3 percent of GDP in recent years, compared with an average of over 0.5 percent for major DAC donors in Europe. Bilateral aid has been focused on countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, with Papua New Guinea the largest recipient. Significant efforts have been made in recent years to improve the effectiveness of Australia’s development assistance. Australia publishes a full range of high quality economic and financial data. Unlike many other industrial countries, however, the CPI is compiled on a quarterly--rather than monthly--basis, reflecting the authorities’ view that more frequent price data would be subject to significant noise. Underlying inflation, which is the basis of the Reserve Bank’s target band and the main focus of financial market participants, is caiculated by the Treasury, not the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Work is currently under way at the Treasury to improve the existing measure of underlying inflation. IV. Staff Appraisal In recent years, policies have aimed at raising sustainable growth while locking in a long-sought low inflation environment. Such a strategy has had Australia’s relatively high unemployment rate as its main focus. Fiscal, monetary, and a growing range of structural policies have been attuned to this end. Implementation is at an advanced stage in some areas, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - early or not as full in some others. Overall, policies have contributed to the Australian economy maintaining a generally favorable course in this period. External conditions have been supportive and it has also helped, of course, that the economy has been going through a favorable phase of the cycle. Thus, underiying inflation has been maintained within the authorities’ target range for the cycle, although it is now also in an above-average phase. Growth has been slowing in the past year toward a more sustainable rate, while remaining solidly based on private business investment. The present pause in above-trend expansion should be temporary. With a resumption of export growth, and a sharp recovery in farm output, demand conditions should remain strong. Policies are now also less restraining. However, unemployment--although declining over the cycle--has remained uncom- fortably above the authorities’ 5 percent target rate, suggesting that the natural rate of unemployment remains stubbornly high. Pressures on the external current account have also increased, reflecting that rather less use has been made of the cyclical recovery to strengthen public finances than would have been desirable. A third issue--against the backdrop of some worrisome wage growth indicators and the rise in underlying inflation--is the appropriate stance of financial policies in the current period. Thus, the Government’s policy strategy needs to be implemented with greater vigor, with fiscal consolidation and structural reform--especially of the labor market--the main areas of emphasis. At the same time, it is crucial that financial policies maintain their firm resolve so that the inflation gains--in credibility as much as in performance--can be consolidated, and a favorable macroeconomic environment maintained for tackling the structural reforms. Delivering on the announced medium-term fiscal framework--and the associated improvement in public saving--is crucial to the overall strategy of raising national saving and its contribution to investment and growth. However, the process of fiscal consolidation at the Commonwealth level has only recently begun, leading the staff to make recommendations in three areas. First, the authorities should avoid any short-term slippages by ensuring that the budget deficit is eliminated in 1995/96, as planned. Second, the Government could enhance private sector confidence by making the achievement of a significant structural budget surplus an explicit policy objective. Third, to provide a better cushion to the risks in the outlook, the Government could consider adopting medium-term fiscal objectives that are even more ambitious than the current budget projections, perhaps aiming to restore national saving closer to the rate achieved in the 1970s. Achieving these results requires raising the contribution of structural fiscal measures that will stand the test of time. On the tax side, the base is narrow and unduly focused on direct taxation. As long as political considerations continue to preclude the implementation of a broad-based consumption tax, the priority should be to broaden the coverage of the wholesale sales tax regime. With a greater role now being given to compulsory Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3o- superannuation contributions, consideration should also be given to reducing their conces- sional fiscal treatment. On the expenditure side, adhering to the announced medium-term path will be a challenge, requiring that new initiatives are not introduced as existing programs expire. There is also room for greater efficiency in the delivery of government services, and special attention should be given to reassessing the generosity of some welfare programs, particularly those that may be impairing private incentives to work and save. The forward-looking framework for monetary policy has served the authorities well. The priority now is to ensure that policy remains sufficiently vigilant to forestall emerging wage and other inflationary pressures in order to consolidate anti-inflation credibility. This is all the more important since this is the first time that the inflation target band has been tested. Given these considerations, and the likelihood that demand conditions will remain relatively strong, financial policies will need to maintain a firm course--with a bias toward further tightening, particularly if wage pressures continue or fiscal slippages occur. While such a policy stance would avoid any risk of misperception of the commitment to maintain inflation at 2-3 percent over the cycle, ways to strengthen its institutional under- pinning could also be explored. With the authorities reluctant to forsake the flexibility afforded by the framework--to average inflation over a cycle--it would help to make publicly known the intention to bring inflation back within the band as soon as possible. Such an approach argues in favor of greater public disclosure of inflation forecasts. Of course, transferring greater responsibility to the Reserve Bank would also help strengthen credibility. Such a strengthened macroeconomic strategy would also help avoid volatility in the foreign exchange market and continue to limit the need for of&&l intervention in it. With the depreciation in the real rate over a long period, competitiveness is not presently an issue, and future structural reform of the economy would safeguard it. Future structural reform would also allow fuller use to be made of Australia’s rich natural resource endowment, and help secure the unemployment objective. Crucial here is the course of labor market policy, closely intertwined with the envisaged restructuring of fiscal expenditures. The issue is, understandably, more in the political arena, and will require firm political resolve to carry forward the transformation of Australia’s industrial relations structure and so strengthen the link between wages and productivity at the enterprise level. Competition policy is the other plank of the policy toward a more efficient economy. Here, the recent landmark agreements with the states toward introducing competition in large sectors of the economy parallel and complete a process that was initiated with the decline in trade protection in the last decade. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Australia take place on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

The aim of the staffs medium-term scenario is to assess whether this will be adequate to achieve an increase in national saving sufficient to both finance a level of invest- ment that will help achieve a rate of,sustainable growth to meet the Government’s objective of reducing unemployment to 5 percent, while also allowing a lower degree of reliance on foreign saving so as to begin to reduce the net external debt ratio. The announced fiscal consolidation at the Commonwealth level, together with the maintenance of the improvement that has already been made at the state and local government and public trading enterprise level, is projected to raise public saving from 2% percent of GDP in 1994/95 to around 6 percent of GDP in 1998199.’ The Government is also aiming to bring about an increase in private sector saving, and new initiatives based on compulsory employer and employee contributions have been introduced. Private saving is projected to increase slightly ti-om 14% percent of GDP in 1994/95 to 15% percent of GDP by the end of the period. The main factors expected to help raise private saving2 are: continued robust economic growth in a relatively low inflation environment, including a rebound in farm income in 1995/96 from the ending of the drought (private saving was likely depressed by the weak farm sector in 1994/95); demographic trends over the next decade; and a positive impact toward the end of the period from the superannuation measures. National saving is, therefore, projected by the staff team to increase from 17 percent of GDP in 1994195 to around 2 1% percent of GDP by 1999/2000. These projections for national saving have been used to derive a profile for investment, given an imposed constraint that the current account deficit is reduced to 3 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period. This results in a reduction in the ratio of net external debt to GDP to 38% percent by the end of the period.3 Projections of the net capital stock based on these investment numbers are then used as an input into the estimated production function presented in the paper on Selected Issues. The growth in investment (averaging around 6 percent per annum in real terms) is estimated to yield growth in the net capital stock of 3 percent per annum and potential growth in the 3-3X percent range. Under existing labor ‘This scenario is predicated on the official budget projections. However, as discussed in the main text, the staff is concerned that the fiscal consolidation envisaged in the budget needs to be better grounded in structural measures. 2The determinants of private saving in Australia and the Government’s superannuation policy are discussed in the forthcoming paper on Selected Issues. 31t is assumed that the mix of debt and equity financing remains the same in the projection period as in 1994/95.

This would result in a decline in unemployment to around 7 percent by the end of the projection period. To achieve a reduction in unemployment to 5 percent will most likely require sustained growth of around 4 percent per annum. In the absence of further gains in productivity as a result of structural reforms, this would require real investment growth of 7-7% percent per annum on a sustained basis. To achieve this within the imposed external constraint would require a corresponding increase in national saving; given the uncertainties associated with private sector saving, this would require a more ambitious fiscal consolidation by the Government. An important area of uncertainty in the scenario is the outlook for private saving. The authorities are of the view that private saving in 1994/95 was unduly depressed by the impact of the drought on farm incomes. They expect a rebound in farm incomes, together with a somewhat greater impact from the introduction of the new superannuation measures, to result in a stronger increase in private saving, of the order of 1 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period. Such an outcome--which would be within the range of historical experience--would allow for slightly higher growth or a larger reduction in the current account deficit than contained in the staff scenario.

Regional trade developments In the regional sphere, Australia remains one of the leading advocates of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) initiative. At their meeting in Osaka in November 1995, APEC leaders agreed on a set of principles to implement the objectives of free trade and open investment that had been announced a year earlier in Bogor, Indonesia. The main principles include comprehensiveness (universal coverage of sectors), WTO consistency, nondiscrimination, and standstill (a commitment not to impose new trade restrictions). From Australia’s perspective, agreement on the principle of comprehensiveness was essential to ensure that agriculture would not be left behind in the trade liberalization process. Australia also attaches considerable importance to the technical and trade facilitation aspects of the APEC agenda, in such areas as the harmonization of standards and customs procedures, and intellectual property protection. In addition to the agreement on principles and processes, the Osaka meeting also delivered a package of initial actions which requires countries to accelerate implementation of some of their Uruguay Round commitments. As part of its contribution, Australia will advance by one year the date for implementing many of its tariff bindings and has also agreed to the inclusion of additional items in its schedule of service sector commitments. Recent modeling work undertaken in Australia suggests that the income gains for Australia from the full implementation of the Bogor Declaration could amount to nearly 7 percent of GDP. Since 1983, bilateral trade relations with New Zealand have been progressively liberalized under the Closer Economic Relations (CER) Agreement. Trade in services has been free, except for sectors inscribed on “negative lists,” since 1989, and merchandise trade has been free of all quantitative and tariff restrictions since 1990. In late October 1994, Australia notified New Zealand of its decision not to proceed with the scheduled November implementation of a single aviation market. A major review of the CER, conducted in 1995, focused on “third generation” trade facilitation issues, such as the harmonization of standards for food products and the mutual recognition of standards for other goods and professions. Efforts to promote trade linkages and cooperation are also being pursued between the CER partners and the members of AFTA, ASEAN, and MERCOSUR. 2. Anti-dumping Australia has been one of the more active users of anti-dumping measures over the past decade. Consistent with previous experience, the number of anti-dumping and countervailing cases initiated rose during the recession, peaking in 1991/92, but decreased to a very low level in 1994/95. However, the number of cases subject to existing measures remains high. Cases are concentrated in the chemical and metal sectors. During 1994/95, the Government amended Australia’s anti-dumping and countervailing legislation to make it consistent with the Uruguay Round agreements.
