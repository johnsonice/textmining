The staffteam’ met with President Tito, Finance Minister Tmga, and representatives of ministries, public enterprises, Snancial institutions, and the donor community. The last consult&ion was completed on October 15, 1993 (F&f/93/190, S/18/93). The 1994 Article IV consultation was postponed at the authorities’ request owing to a change in Government and the Executive Board was notified of the postponement (EBD/95/3, l/5/95 and EBD/95/62, 5/5/95). Kiribati has accepted the obligations of Article WE, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. At the conclusionofthc nsultati Executive Directors commended the authorities for the continuation of fiscal restraint and the prudent management of their external assets. They underscored the importance of achieving higher sustainable economic growth. Directors encouraged the authorities to take steps to improve the environment for foreign investment, promote private sector development, especially through privatixation and commercialization of public enterprises, and develop the financial sector. Kiribati’s dw is weak. in recent years, efforts have been made to improve macroeconomic data, especially the national accounts, the balance of payments, and the public finances, with technica.l assistance from the Fund and the Asian Development Bank. Further improvements are essential to aid in economic analysis and policy decisions. Publication of data has been limited and no data are regularly transmitted to the Fund. IL Background A. Key Economic Featurea and Trends Kiribati is a small economy with the lowest per capita income (US0717 in 1993) among Pa&c island JMF member countries. Most of the population (about 76,000) is employed in the subsistence sector and economic activities in the formal sector are dominated by the public sector. The production base is narrow, with copra, fish, and seaweed as the principal products, and there is little industrial activity. Economic development is constrained by a shortage of skiUed workers, weak im%astmcture, and remoteness from international markets. The financial sector is at an early stage of development: the Australian dollar is used as the legal tender; there is no central bank or monetary authority; and the Bank of Kiribati, jointly owned by the Government and an Australian bank, is the sole commercial bank. r The staRteam comprised Mr. Kim (Head), Mr. Sidgwick, and Ms. Duprat (ah SEA). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- Developments over the decade through 1992 were characterised by a fall in real per capita income. Real GDP growth, fluctuating with climatic conditions, averaged only 1 percent per year, less than half of the population growth rate. However, intlation was held to 4.5 percent per year, broadly in line with price increases in major trading partners, especially Australia. Despite extremely small export earnings, the overall balance of payments was in large surplus, as trade deficits were more than offset by surpluses in the services account and external grant receipts; large official external assets* were accumulated, mainly in the Revenue Equaliition Reserve Fund (RERF) (see Box). Kiribati: Revenue Equalhtkan Reserve Fund Origin. The Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) was established by the British colonial administration in 1956 to bold royalties fkom phosphate mining in trust for the people OfKiribati in light of foreseeable depletion of the deposits.

To this end, central government current expenditure was contained at levels compatible with the drawdown of only a fraction of the annual investment income of the RERF. Development expenditure was limited almost entirely to projects timded by external grants. The overall balance, adjusted for the total investment income of the RERF, registered substantial surpluses and virtually no recourse was made to borrowing from domestic sources. B. Economic Developments in 1993-94 Available data indicate that develooments in 1993-94 continued to be characterised by relatively weak economic activity and financial stability. -- Real GDP growth is estimated to have averaged about 1.5 percent (Table 1 and Chart 1). Copra production continued to recover from the decline of 1990, reaching a level well above the historical average, primarily in response to higher domestic support prices. However, the fish catch remained low, as technical problems, poor management, and financial diiculties persisted. Manufacturing and tourism remained stagnant. -- Inflation averaged 5.5 percent, slightly above the rate in main trading partner countries, primarily reflecting higher prices for clothing and transportation. -- The overall external balance was in surplus, averaging IEA 16 million (33 percent of GDP) during 1993-94, aided by substantial surpluses on the services account primarily reflecting fishing license fees and investment income from the RERF (Table 2 and Chart 2). External assets stood at $A 358 million (8.7 years of imports) at end-1994, although the RERF suffered from a gross valuation loss of $A 45 million in 1994, owing to an appreciation of the Australian dollar and a sharp fall in bond and equity prices. -- Fiscal oolicy remained cautious, and the adjusted overall balance was in huge surplus (Table 3 and Chart 3). Revenues exceeded the budget estimates, reflecting buoyant fishing license fees and import duties, while current expenditure was strictly contained within appropriations; as a result, the budgeted drawdowns from the RERF ($A 7.5 million each year) were not effected. Development expenditure declined substantially, as turnkey projects were completed, and was financed mainly by external grants. -- Domestic lending by the Bank of Kiribati remained low owing to the lack of investment opportunities and the bulk of deposits continued to be redeposited overseas (Table 4 and Chart 4). The average deposit rate set by the Bank increased in line with the Australian market and, with lending rates remainin g relatively stable partly reflecting implicit administrative control, the spread between the average lending and deposit rates narrowed. -- Between June 1993 and April 1995, the real effective exchange rate depreciated by 3 percent following developments in the Australian dollar vis-a-vis other major currencies Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- (Chart 5). The trade and payments regime remained liberal; there were no major changes in tariff rates, except for reductions on some food items. III. Report on the Discussions Discussions took place against the background of a series of political changes in 1994, which included the dissolution of Parliament in May, defeat for the ruling party in ensuing parliamentary and presidential elections for the first time since Kiribati’s independence, and the formation of a new Government in October. Fiscal conservatism and rapid privatization were among the election issues. The new Government’s economic strategy stressed the importance of reversing the weak growth performance. through more active policies. Discussions centered on assessing whether the 1995 budget and associated policies would be consistent with the dual objectives of promoting higher sustainable growth while maintaining financial stability, as well as on the authorities’ policy with regard to the RERF and data issues. A. Short-Term Outlook and Policies The economic outlook for 1995 is strongly influenced by fiscal policy, which has assumed an expansionary stance. Consistent with the likely budgetary outcome presented in Table 1, real GDP is projected to grow by 2.5 percent and inflation to accelerate to 6.5 percent. The external current account surplus is projected to narrow, although the overall balance of payments would remain in surplus. 1. Budget for 1995 The 1995 budna shows a deficit of 6 percent of GDP compared with a surplus of 24 percent of GDP in 1994. Revenue and grants (other than RERF drawdowns) are budgeted to grow by 22 percent after a decline in 1994; a fall in tax revenue, reflecting lower customs duties on essential goods and the elimination of export taxes on scrap metal, is expected to be more than offset by higher nontax revenue from fishing license fees and a drawdown of $A 7.5 million !?om the RERP. However, current expenditure is budgeted to expand by 56 percent, reflecting a 47 percent increase in wages and salaries (a combination of the across-the-board SA 500 increase, the adjustment of the salary scale, and the tilling of all existing vacancies) and substantial rises in appropriations for social services, maintenance, and transfers. Development expenditure is budgeted to grow by 40 percent. The overall deficit is budgeted to be fully financed by drawing down accumulated tLnds for fiscal operations. The authorities stated that the budgeted increase in current expenditure is designed to counter an erosion in real wages/salaries for civil servants and the prolonged neglect of maintenance and repair, especially in the education and health sectors, as a result of the tight expenditure policy pursued over the years. They stated that the sharp increase in budgeted development expenditure assumed a rebound in external grants; however, less than half of the budgeted amount was funded by midyear and total external timding for the year is likely to be no more than three fourths ofthe budget estimate. They indicated that they would limit Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7. development expenditure to a level that could be financed by external grants and avoid drawdowns from the RERF to finance unt%nded projects. The mission noted that, even if development expenditures were cut, the budget for 1995 would still be excessively expansionary, marking a major departure from the past stance. It stressed the need in 1995 to reduce current expenditure to a more sustainable level and arrest the decline in tax revenue in relation to GDP. On the expenditure side, actions should be taken to stop hiring new staff; freeze all existing vacancies; curtail travel and other administrative expenditures; and restrain transfers to local governments. On the revenue side, in view of the limited domestic tax base, steps should be taken to increase temporarily duties on motor vehicles and other consumer goods, as well as to reverse the recent reduction in the customs duties on rice, sugar, and flour. The authorities responded that they will shortly review appropriations for current expenditure and examine other options available for fiscal tightening in the remainder of 1995. The mission’s estimate of the likely budgetary outcome is presented in Table 1. 2. Public enterprises The financial oosition of oublic entemrises has been weak, resulting in a tripling of subsidies since 1992 and an increase in borrowing from the Bank of Kiribati under government guarantees during the first half of 1995. These developments have been associated in part with inadequate pricing policies, and the mission underscored the need to adjust tariffs, including the elimination of cross-subsidization between electricity and sewage services provided by the Public Utilities Board and an increase in the rental charges of the Housing Corporation. The mission expressed concern over the provision of government guarantees to the public enterprises and suggested their termination. While not disagreeing with the mission, the authorities stated that their plan is to facilitate timdamental reform of the public enterprises. To this end, a unit was established within the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in 1994 to review their operations, identify problems, and recommend corrective actions. Reforms would focus for the time being on corporatization and commercialiition. Reversing the decision by the previous Government, they stressed that privatization would be considered only atter enterprises became commercially sound. The mission encouraged the authorities to adopt a flexible approach to privatization, emphasizing its potential contribution to the strengthening of the capital base and managerial skills. B. Management of the RERF and Other Financial Issues The authorities have recently taken a number of actions to improve management of the w. These actions, which are broadly in line with recommendations made by past Fund missions, include the hiring of a second fund manager (with initial funds of $A 50 million) and the appointment of a custodial company. The latter is expected to provide, inter alia, monthly reports, which will supplement the existing quarterly reports submitted by the Rmd managers. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- In addition, the authorities have decided to appoint a specialist to assess the performance of the fimd managers and review the current benchmarks and operational guidelines, including those for currency diversiication, asset structure (especially the equity-bond ratio), and risk management, On the basis of recommendations by the specialist, further actions are expected to be taken to strengthen fund management, including the appointment of a third manager. The authorities stated that, in the absence of a major improvement in Kiribati’s capacity for productive capital investment, the RERP will remain the principal form of Kiribati’s wealth accumulation and that a further increase in the timd will be important to generate additional income to supplement the limited domestic production base, as well as to provide a cushion to unforeseen external shocks. Therefore, their policv with read to the m will continue to aim at broadly maintaining its real per capita value over the medium term, with the drawdowns to finance the current budget limited to a small fraction of investment income (equivalent to about 2-3 percent of the value of the Cmd). The authorities underscored that the increased use of RERF resources to fund development expenditure will follow actions to improve their capacity to implement a viable public investment program. The authorities foresaw no immediate alternative to the present monetarv arrangement under which the Australian dollar is used as the domestic currency, until monetary management skills and the financial market are deveioped. While the exchange rate experienced some volatility in real effective terms, the recent developments under the present arrangement did not adversely a&t external competitiveness. With regard to the bankina sector, the authorities stated that lending to the private sector is likely to remain low, despite the impending implementation of the recent decision permitting a member of the National Provident Fund to pledge up to 70 percent of his/her contribution as collateral for housing loans. The level and structure of interest rates will be rationalized in response to the introduction by the Bank of Kiribati of a greater differentiation of lending rates according to risk premia. Over the last two years, steps were taken by the Development Bank of Gibati to reclassify loan portfolios, improve loan wllection, and make provision for nonperforming loans. Further actions are expected on the basis of recommendations from ongoing technical assistance. C. Growth, Investment, and Medium-Term Prospects 1. Measures to promote growth The achievement of higher economic growth over the medium term depends on expansion in coma fisheries. and tourism. Regarding copra, actions are needed to replace aging trees and improve extension services to increase productivity. Regarding fishing, an incentive scheme based on a bonus system that haa been introduced by the state fishing company is contributing to higher catches thus far in 1995, but there is an urgent need to modemize the aging fishing fleet, develop infrastructure, and promote marketing. With regard to tourism, improved international air links and hotel accommodations would be needed. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- mission observed that the achievement of these goals would be facilitated by increased foreign direct investment and that actions should be taken to improve the legal framework for such investment, including greater transparency in the existing guidelines, the simplification of approval procedures, and improvement in land-leasing arrangements. A prerequisite for the realiition of growth potential is the imolementation of a credible oublic investment oroaram, especially to strengthen infrastructure. The outcome of the Seventh National Development Plan (1992-95) was disappointing because of the lack of linkage between the public investment program and the annual development budget and the absence of review and monitoring schemes. This was compounded by the endorsement of a program that comprised numerous small projects without clear priorities. There is a need to address these problems in the context of the Eighth National Development Plan (1996-99). 2. Medium-term prospects The medium-term outlook will depend critically on the stance of fiscal policy. Unless corrective actions are taken to the present expansionary budgetary policy, there is a serious risk of generating expectations of further large increases in appropriations which, if fulfilled, would cause a widening of the fiscal deficit and a weakening of the balance of payments, especially given a projected decline in fishing license fees owing to the recent end of the prolonged El Nitlo climate and a consequent reduction in fishing by foreign vessels in Kiribati’s exclusive economic zone. The financing of larger fiscal deficits would require unprecedented borrowing from the domestic banking system or large drawdowns from the RERP which would undermine the achievement of the authorities’ policy objective to maintain its value, especially on a real per capita basis. An alternative and more desirable scenario would be the restoration of cautious budgetary management, accompanied by measures to promote economic growth with the support of continued inflows of external grants and increased concessional loan disbursements which donors appear willing to provide (Table 5). More specifically, the scenario assumes: (i) a gradual acceleration in real GDP growth to 3.5 percent by the year 2000; (ii) a larger public investment program, accompanied by higher private investment; and (iii) a fiscal policy aimed at limiting current expenditure to a level which maintains the real value of the RERP. Under this scenario, the current account surplus in relation to GDP is projected to narrow, reflecting rising imports to support higher investment and growth, although with emerging surpluses on the capital account, the overall balance would remain comfortable. This would permit the RERP to increase in real terms and provide a cushion for unforseen adverse external developments. However, apart from the risk of slippage in fiscal policy, this scenario may prove to be optimistic with respect to economic growth given the possibility that improvement in absorption capacity may remain limited.

Data Issues Notwithstanding progress made in improving macroeconomic data primarily through Fund technical assistance, Riribati’s M is weak in terms of its quality, coverage, and currentness, as described in Annex II. In particular, there is an urgent need to reduce the lag in updating key macroeconomic statistics, especially those on the national accounts, the balance of payments, and public enterprise finances, which are available only up to 1993. The general weaknesses in data primarily reflect staEconstraints, as well as the lack of coordination among ministries. Recognizing the importance of addressing these weaknesses, the authorities stated that efforts would be stepped up to improve the quality and currentness of macroeconomic data, especially selected core data essential for policy decision and analysis, and that these data would be transmitted to the Fund on a regular basis. They indicated that available macroeconomic data through 1994 would be published soon. IV. Staff Appraisal Riribati’s economic performance in 1993-94 continued to be mixed. Real GDP growth remained below the population growth rate. However, inflation was moderate and the overall external balance continued to register large surpluses. Despite valuation losses incurred in 1994, external assets remained high. Overall financial stability reflected prudent fiscal management aimed at containing current and development expenditures within available budgetary resources. The central challenge facing Kiribati remains to promote higher sustainable economic growth, while at the same time maintaining financial stability. In a major break with past conservatism, the ne.wlv elected Government’s 1995 budget incorporated a sharp increase in current expenditure. This approach is excessively expansionary and unsustainable over the medium term. Without immediate remedial measures, the budget deficit will widen sharply, and larger drawdowns from the RERP, or unprecedented borrowing from the banking sector, will be required. Given the importance of fiscal stability to achieve sustainable higher economic growth, the staffurges the authorities to take adjustment measures without delay. These measures should focus on cuts in nonessential expenditures, as well as actions to wunter a decline in tax revenue. The financial position of key public entermises remains weak, resulting in budgetary subsidies and borrowing from the banking sector with government guarantees. Subsidies continue to be associated with inadequate tariff structures, and the staffencourages the authorities to pursue flexible pricing policies. Provision of government guarantees should be avoided to ensure an efficient allocation of financial resources and forestall potential fiscal costs. The staff supports the Government’s current focus on corporatization or commerciahzation, but encourages a forceful approach to privatization in view of its potential for the infusion of capital and managerial skills. The staff welcomes the recent actions taken by the authorities to strengthen the management of the RERP, including the hiring of a second fund manager and the appointment Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-ll- of a custodial company. The RERF remains the principal form of wealth accumulation in Kiribati because of the country’s limited capacity for capital investment, and a Cuther increase in the timd will provide an effective avenue to generate additional income, as well as a cushion for unexpected adverse external developments. The staffwelcomes the authorities’ intention to continue to limit drawdowns from the RERF to finance current expenditure, so as to broadly maintain its real per capita value over the medium term. The use of the Australian dollar as the domestic currency provides an appropriate arrangement in the absence of a well-developed institutional framework and sufficient skills for monetary management and the staff agrees with the authorities’ intention to retain this arrangement. The rapid increase in the population underscores the critical imoortance of hieher economic strowth over the medium term. The achievement of this objective will require the effective implementation of measures to improve productivity in wpra, fish, and tourism. Increased foreign direct investment will be crucial to realiie growth potential especially in view of its contribution to improvement in managerial skills and efforts should be made to eliminate legal impediments. The realization of higher growth will also require a step-up in public sector investment to strengthen infrastructure and, to this end, efforts should be intensified to improve absorption capacity. While progress has been made in improving economic data, Cuther efforts remain important in improving their quality and coverage. Also, there is an urgent need to make these data more current. The staffwelwmes the authorities’ decision to update core data and transmit them to the Fund on a regular basis. The staff also welcomes the authorities’ intention to publish available macroeconomic data for public information, It is recommended that Kiribati remain on the standard 12-month cvcle.

Outstanding Statistical Issues Although the authorities have stepped up their efforts in recent years to improve key macroeconomic data, especially through technical assistance from the Fund and the Asian Development Bank, Khibati’s economic database is generally weak, primarily reflecting stat&g constraints. There is no country page for Kiribati in the IntemationalFinanciaI Statistics. No data are currently provided to the Fund on a regular basis between consultations. Kiribati has very few statistical publications. 1. National accounts and prices Progress has been made in the area of national accounts with technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank in late 1989, the PFTAC in 1994, and STA in March-April 199% However, national accounts data suffer from a number of fundamental weaknesses. They are currently compiled only on a production basis and no data are available on an expenditure basis. The GDP deflator is proxied by the consumer price index and there is an urgent need to develop appropriate deflators. Further improvement in national accounts data requires the better compilation of raw data, the establishment of an economy survey program, and the completion of a household income and expenditure survey, which is currently under preparation by the Ministry of Finance and Economic PIamring. The consumer price index is produced on a quarterly basis with a lag of about two months, but the weights are based on a 1975 household consumption survey. New weights are expected to be produced following the completion of the household income and expenditure survey. No wholesale price index is currently available. 2. Government finance The authorities have recently produced consolidated accounts for the general government, although tiuther improvement in the consolidation is necessary. The general government accounts provide fairly comprehensive information on central government tax and nontax revenues, recurrent expenditure, and major accounts, including STABEX, other trust accounts, and the Revenue Equaliition Reserve Fund. However, information on the timing and amount of disbursements of external aid and development expenditure is incomplete. With regard to public enterprise finances, basic balance sheets are available only with a long lag (about two years) in a nonstandardiied form. Government finance data are not reported to the Fund for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - ANNEXII 3. Money and banking Monetary data are compiled by the Bank of Kiribati (the sole commercial bank jointly owned by the Government and an Australian commercial bank), but they are not reported to the government on a regular basis. To improve the monitoring of monetary developments, there is a need to obligate the Bank of Kiribati to submit key monetary statistics to the Statistics Department of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. Monetary data on the central government need to be reconciled with fiscal data and those on claims on public enterprises are incomplete. 4. Balance of payments Technical assistance has been provided since 1987 through STA, more recently through the PFTAC, to improve balance of payments data, helping the authorities in revising the data series through 1991 in a manner consistent with the Fund’s methodology. However, the compilation of balance of payments data suffers from a long time lag and incomplete information on key external transactions, especially nonfactor service accounts, external grants and loans, and capital accounts.
