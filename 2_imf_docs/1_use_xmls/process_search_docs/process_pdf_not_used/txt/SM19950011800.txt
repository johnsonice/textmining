Introduction Discussions with the Dominican Republic for the 1995 Article IV con- sultation were held in Santo Domingo during October 12-November 2, 1994 and February 13-24, 1995 and at headquarters during November'l4-18, 1994, and April 24-27, 1995. w The representatives of the Dominican Republic included the Secretary of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other senior officials. The mission also met with President Joaquin Balaguer. After a period of uncertainty associated with Presidential elections, the authorities embarked on a new adjustment program which was the subject of comprehensive discussions with the staff. So far, however, the authorities have not decided to request the Fund to support their efforts with a financial arrangement. However, in early May 1995 (after the completion of the Article IV consultation discussions) wage increases for public and private sector employees were announced which exceeded by a large margin the assumptions considered in the discussions. Though some compensatory tax measures were adopted, serious concerns have raised regarding the feasibility of the authorities' macroeconomic objectives and the competitiveness of the economy. As a result, there would be a need to reassess the authorities' program in case they request an arrangement with the Fund. The most recent Article IV consultation with the Dominican Republic, together with the midterm review of the program supported by the stand-by arrangement approved on July 9, 1993, was concluded by the Executive Board on December 20, 1993 (EBM/93/174). On that occasion, Directors commended the authorities for their progress in improving the prospects for the balance of payments and cautioned against a possible weakening of fiscal policy in the run-up to the mid-May 1994 Presidential elections. They encouraged the authorities to formulate a framework for medium-term struc- tural adjustment, to promote the development of the private sector, and to improve relations with commercial and official creditors. As of April 30, 1995, total outstanding purchases and loans amounted to 78.3 percent of the Dominican Republic's quota. The Dominican Republic's relations with the Fund are summarized in Table 1 and Appendix I and with the World Bank group are set out in Appendix II. The Dominican Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. 1;/ Staff representatives were Mr. Leone (Head), Mr. Dunn, Ms. Guin-Siu, Mr. Inter, and Ms. Sheybani (all WHD), Ms. Chanda and Mr. Perone (PDR), Ms. Eyzaguirre (Assistant-WHD), and Ms. Hern6ndez (Assistant-PDR). Mr. Estrella, Assistant to the Executive Director for the Dominican Republic, participated in the policy discussions.

Backpround and DeveloDments Through Early 1995 In mid-1990, following several years of persistent macroeconomic imbalances, the Dominican Republic began implementing a comprehensive program of adjustment and structural reforms which was supported by a 19-month stand-by arrangement from the Fund approved in August 1991 for 35 percent of quota. 1/ The performance under the program was satis- factory; real GDP recovered in 1991 and rose by 7.8 percent in 1992; the rate of inflation declined markedly; and the net international reserves of the Central Bank rose (Table 2). All quantitative performance criteria under the arrangement were observed. On July 9, 1993, the Executive Board approved a nine-month stand-by arrangement for the equivalent of 20 percent of quota and a purchase equi- valent to 21.8 percent of quota under the CCFF. The 1993/94 program called for a consolidation of the gains already achieved in the areas of inflation, the balance of payments and economic growth through the maintenance of a strong fiscal stance, and the completion of structural reforms. Performance under the 1993/94 stand-by arrangement was mixed. During 1993 real GDP growth slowed to 3 percent, the 12-month increase in consumer prices declined to 2.8 percent (from 5.1 percent in 1992), and net interna- tional reserves of the Central Bank rose by US$132 million. However, owing to the rise in public spending in the last quarter of the year, the overall financial position of the public sector moved from a surplus of 1.3 percent of GDP in 1992 to a deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP in 1993 (a balanced budget had been targeted in the program). The end-December ceilings for the overall deficit of the nonfinancial public sector and the combined net credit of the Central Bank and the Reserves Bank (the state-owned commercial bank) to the nonfinancial public sector were exceeded by small margins and some external arrears were accumulated. The final purchase under the arrangement was not made. There was a further slackening of fiscal and credit policies in 1994 and the implementation of structural reforms stalled during the run-up to the elections. The electoral result remained uncertain until mid-August when a political pact was signed between the two major parties; President Balaguer was declared the winner but his term was shortened to end in August 1996 with new Presidential elections scheduled for May 1996. In 1994 real GDP rose by 4.3 percent, compared to 3 percent in 1993, with gains in mining, construction, tourism, and communications outweighing a drought-related decline in agriculture. Domestic investment is estimated to have increased by less than 1 percentage point of GDP with respect to 1993 (as a decline in private investment partly offset the increase in public investment) while national saving increased in relation to GDP by 1/ At that time, the Fund also approved a purchase under the CCFF for 40 percent of quota.

The 12-month rate of increase in consumer prices rose to 14.3 percent in December 1994, from 2.8 percent in December 1993. The primary balance of the nonfinancial public sector shifted to a sizable deficit in 1994 and the overall fiscal deficit reached 2.9 percent of GDP (Table 3). Revenue from taxes on international trade declined, mainly because of the reduction of an import tariff surcharge and a very lax administration (which resulted in a revenue loss of about 0.8 percent of GDP). Public investment accelerated as high visibility projects (such as road works, aqueducts, and housing programs) were completed in the run-up to the elections. Also, the finances of the public enterprises weakened, largely because of increased generation costs of the electricity company (due to the drought), expenses incurred in the rehabilitation of the state- owned gold mine, and a weakening in revenue collection. Both the overall fiscal deficit (2.9 percent of GDP) as well as the net repayment of foreign credit registered during 1994 (0.3 percent of GDP) were financed by the banking system (mainly by the Central Bank) (Table 4). Credit expansion also resulted from liquidity assistance provided by the Central Bank to the second largest private commercial bank in May 1994 and from payments to depositors of failed institutions (as explained below). At the same time, capital outflows began to take place, and the growth of private domestic deposits slowed notwithstanding the increase in interest rates (Chart 1). Official net international reserves declined by about US$470 million with gross reserves falling to about one and a half months of '. imports (Table 5). 1/ The spread between the official and the inter-bank exchange rate (negligible at the end of 1993) widened. The real effective exchange rate appreciated by 3.7 percent (Chart 2). The external current account deficit narrowed from 2 percent of GDP in 1993 to an estimated 1.2 percent of GDP in 1994 (see Table 2). The small improvement was mainly due to higher export prices, the resumption of mining operations (gold and ferronickel), and continued strong tourism and free trade zone receipts. The capital account registered a deficit for the first time since 1990. There was an outflow of private capital and amortization obligations on the official debt exceeded disbursements, as certain disbursements from multilateral organizations were postponed due to delays in the pace of structural reforms. In early September 1994 a new economic team was appointed and some corrective measures were adopted. The peso was devalued by about 3 percent in the official market, credit policies were tightened, and interest rates on central bank certificates were increased. Also, President Balaguer announced steps to curb public expenditure and improve tax administration. 1/ In part, the reduction in the official net international reserves was explained by the up front payment of US$172 million involved in the global restructuring of debt to commercial banks. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 4 - As a result, net international reserves increased by about US$49 million during the period end-September 1994 through end-March 1995 and the infla- tion began to fall in early 1995 (see Chart 1). Also, the inter-bank exchange rate stabilized, although a spread of about 4 l/2 percent remained vis-a-vis the official rate by end-March 1995. Preliminary data also show that net domestic assets of the Central Bank and net combined credit of the Central Bank and the Reserves Bank to the nonfinancial public sector contracted significantly during the first quarter of 1995. However, the increases in wages for workers in the public and private sector granted in early May 1995 have created concerns regarding the feasibility of the authorities' objectives to reduce inflation and improve the balance of payments, as well as the prospects for growth. In this context, the spread between the official and the inter-bank exchange rate had widened to about 6.5 percent by mid-May. III. Policy Discussions Following the weakening of financial policies in 1994, discussions focused on the actions needed to restore macroeconomic stability, deter capital outflows, complete the settlement of remaining external arrears, and resume the implementation of structural reforms. The authorities' object- ives are to reduce the 12-month rate of inflation to about 7 percent by end- 1995 and to about 5 percent by end-1996, and to raise net international reserves by about US$35 million in 1995 and by US$50 million in 1996. Real GDP growth of about 4 percent is expected in both 1995 and 1996. In the context of the authorities' program, the external current account deficit is envisaged to decline to less than 1 percent in 1995 and 1996. The core of the authorities' program for 1995/96 is the elimination of the fiscal deficit mainly through a sharp cut in public investment from the exceptionally high levels reached in 1993/94. Fiscal policy will be comple- mented by a tight credit policy based on a sharp curtailment of the expan- sion of net credit from the monetary authorities to the nonfinancial public sector. The authorities acknowledged the need to unify the exchange system under a freely floating exchange rate. As noted above, some measures already have been adopted but the unification of the exchange system remains to be implemented. Also, the magnitude of the salary increases recently granted, both for workers in the public and the private sectors, raises concerns regarding the feasibility of the objectives contemplated in the authorities' program. The authorities' program also contemplates the completion of negotia- tions with foreign creditors to clear all remaining arrears which as of end- 1994 amounted to about US$220 million (see below). In this connection, the authorities have already reached restructuring agreements with the OPEC and Venezuela and are striving to complete negotiations with Taiwan Province of China. However, the continued large net repayment of foreign credit, the need to rebuild international reserves, and the full settlement of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 5 - remaining arrears would result in a financing gap of about US$220 million (equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP) over the period April 1995 to March 1996, despite the improvement in the external current account envisaged in the authorities' program, The staff has reviewed the financing needs of the authorities' program and has come to the conclusion that closing of the noted gap would necessitate rescheduling of: (i) arrears to a few Japanese suppliers; (ii) eligible arrears to the U.S. Commodity Credit Corporation; and (iii) a portion of current maturities to Paris Club creditors. In this latter case a Paris Club meeting would be required. In this connection the authorities continue negotiations with the Japanese suppliers, have approached Paris Club creditors, and held discussions with the U.S. Commodity Credit Corpora- tion to ascertain if rescheduling of part of outstanding arrears and of a portion of current maturities is feasible. These discussions are still ongoing. In the absence of an agreement with these creditors there will be an unfinanced gap in the authorities' program. 1. Public finances During the discussions, the authorities recognized that achievement of their balance of payments and inflation objectives requires a fiscal adjust- ment of about 3 percent of GDP compared with the 1994 outturn which would duplicate in 1995 in the absence of measures. In spite of this effort, financing of about 2 percent of GDP would be needed to close the gap identified above. The authorities are of the view that the additional fiscal effort needed in case their rescheduling assumptions fail to materialize would be difficult to deliver in the present political circumstances (see Tables 3 and 5). To achieve the fiscal adjustment of 3 percent of GDP, the authorities have decided to implement a cut in public investment of 2 l/2 percent of GDP. The authorities believe that this cut is feasible (as investment in 1994 was exceptionally high) and will not affect the core public sector investment plan for 1995/96 which will focus on high priority projects, particularly those related to the rehabilitation works in the Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE), social sector projects in education, health, and sanitation, and highway and ports rehabilitation. 1/ Measures to contain current expenditure have also been adopted including the layoff of some personnel in various government dependencies and in the Central Bank. Revenue measures are projected to contribute to the adjustment effort to the extent of l/2 percent of GDP on a net basis, after taking into account the impact of the elimination of the import surcharge in mid-1995. L/ In this way, the authorities aim at continuing improving the quality of government expenditure (see Section 6 below). The authorities pointed out that the share of military expenditure in total public sector expend- iture continues to be small (less than 1 percent of GDP in 1993). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - The improvement would come largely from the restoration of a more normal level of collection of custom revenues after the noted weakening in 1994. To this aim, the authorities have replaced the head of the Customs Office, and initiated a judicial process to assess responsibilities regarding the revenue loss in 1994. The authorities are taking other steps to improve the administration and collection of domestic taxes. The Internal Revenue Office is being modernized with technical assistance from the IDB. Reforms include the streamlining of procedures, the strengthening of tax collection systems and the establishment of an office of major tax payers, the computerization of control and information systems, and the training of personnel. The staff stressed the need to pursue these efforts vigorously in view of the elimina- tion of the import surcharge in mid-1995, and the reduced reliance on inter- national trade taxes expected over the medium term following the recent signing by the Dominican Government of the Uruguay Round Agreement. The staff also recommended the value-added tax to be increased from the current 8 percent rate, but the authorities perceived this measure to be difficult to deliver at the present time. Under the current arrangement the petroleum tax is calculated as the differential between the ex-refinery cost of the oil derivatives and the prices at the pump set by the Government. Under this arrangement the tax revenue is vulnerable to changes in international prices of oil and the exchange rate. The staff has recommended the conversion of the petroleum tax to an ad valorem basis so as to avoid revenue losses. The authorities were reluctant to modify the present arrangement before improvements in tax administration are completed, but they intend to preserve the revenue margin even in the event of an increase in world oil prices or possible adjustments in the exchange rate. A subsidy on the domestic consumption of propane gas has already been reduced to compensate for the adjustment in the official exchange rate. The authorities indicated their intention to further reduce this subsidy and introduce additional measures, including an increase in the domestic prices of oil derivatives, if necessary. In an effort to promote private investment in the electric power sector, the authorities are considering dividing the state-owned electricity company into three units: the generation facility, the distribution and commercialization system, and the transmission company. l/ A draft Electricity Law was submitted to Congress in March 1994 which sets the policy and regulatory role for the Government, introduces competition in power supply, and permits private participation in the power sector. The staff has recommended that several state-owned enterprises operating under a lJ Both, the generation facility and the distribution and commercializa- tion system would be integrated into one or more private companies. The transmission company would remain in the hands of the State, at least initially.

Monetary and credit policv Following a period of lax monetary policy in 1994, the authorities were confident that the strengthening of the nonfinancial public sector in 1995 would curb the need for net credit from the Central Bank and the Reserves Bank. Moreover, in September 1994 they tightened monetary policy by increasing the annual interest rate paid in central bank certificates by 4 percentage points to 18 percent, and by limiting the net credit operations of FIDE and INFRATUR (two trust funds administered by the Central Bank) to the availability of medium- and long-term financing. Also, since September 1994, significant efforts have been made by the authorities of the Central Bank to reduce the operating expenses of the Bank. Against this background, the authorities have adopted a monetary program designed to achieve the inflation and balance of payments objectives noted above. The program provides for the increase in net domestic assets of the Central Bank 1/ to be limited to 0.3 percent of GDP in 1995 and 0.1 percent in 1996 (compared to nearly 5 percent of GDP in 1994) and for an accumulation of official net international reserves of US$35 million in 1995 and US$50 million in 1996 (compared to the loss of about US$470 million in 1994). Liabilities of the banking system to the private sector (M2) are being projected to increase by 12 percent in 1995 and about 11 percent in 1996 in line with the expected growth in nominal GDP. The authorities expect their program to help restore confidence and deter capital outflows. The staff stressed, however, that liquidity and solvency problems of financial institutions, the reemergence of central bank losses, and fiscal inaction could complicate monetary management and affect confidence. According to data from the Superintendency of Banks, the ratio of non- performing loans to capital in commercial banks reached about 25 percent by mid-1994. A recent assessment of financial institutions' portfolios has brought into the open the problems of about 35 institutions (most of them small) that had to be liquidated. The deposit liabilities of these insti- tutions amount to approximately 1.3 percent of the total deposit liabilities of the financial system, or 0.5 percent of GDP (RD$650 million). Payments of about RD$360 million to depositors of these institutions already have been made and pending balances would be paid in long-term central bank certificates of deposit with a view to postpone the monetary impact. Central bank losses (of about l/2 percent of GDP in 1994) have re- emerged, as a result of reduced income from foreign assets, the poor quality of the Central Bank's asset portfolio, the payments to depositors of lJ Defined as the difference between currency in circulation and net international reserves. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - institutions being liquidated, the increasing cost of sterilization, and high operating costs (see Table 4). The staff advised the authorities to pursue vigorously ongoing efforts to reduce the operating costs of the Central Bank and to strengthen its financial position by incorporating the cost of quasi-fiscal operations (including the payments to depositors of troubled financial institutions) into the budget. The staff emphasized that fiscal inaction would also put excessive pressure on monetary policy. In particular, achievement of the authorities' monetary policy objectives against the background of a weak fiscal stance would require intense sterilization and lead to increasing costs for the Central Bank. In 1994 performance has been mixed regarding the implementation of structural reforms in the financial sector. Progress has continued in the area of banking supervision and regulation with the enforcement of new rules for the assessment of the largest debtors, the classification of financial institutions loan portfolios, and provisioning. Financial institutions are in the process of implementing the new regulatory framework and adopting more cautious credit policies, albeit at the cost of increased financial spreads. However, the pace of the legislative reform and the modernization of the central bank operations suffered delays which the team that took office in September 1994 is striving to overcome. In late February 1995, the Government presented a draft Monetary and Financial Code to Congress aimed at consolidating reforms in the financial sector, increasing competi- tion among institutions, and strengthening the autonomy of the Central Bank in the conduct of monetary policy. The authorities are in the process of improving monetary programming and developing market-based monetary policy instruments with technical assistance from MAE, and they have taken steps to streamline the Central Bank's administrative structure. 3. Wages and prices Wages are negotiated freely in the Dominican Republic, but are affected by developments in minimum wages. Minimum wages in the public sector were increased by 20 percent in 1991. In 1994 minimum wages were increased by 15 percent for most private businesses and 10 percent for those operating in the free trade zones. As inflation increased in 1994, unions started pressing for pay increases for public and private sector employees. During the discussions, the authorities recognized the need to maintain a cautious stance regarding minimum wages and public sector wages in order to restore a strong fiscal stance and boost competitiveness. However, on May 7, 1995, the Executive promulgated a law that granted an increase of 30 percent in minimum wages in the public sector and an increase of 20 per- cent in the salaries of public sector employees earning wages higher than the minimum wage. At the same time, the National Salary Commission established an increase of 20 percent in minimum wages in the private sector. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - To compensate for the increased wage bill in the public sector, the excise tax rates on alcoholic beverages (except rum) and tobacco products were increased to 20 percent (from 10 percent) and on rum and ethyl alcohol to 25 percent (from 15 percent). However, these measures do not seem suffi- cient to offset the effects of the increase in wages. Furthermore, in the private sector, competitiveness has been affected, particularly in the free trade zones and in the tourism sector. The authorities noted that most price controls have been eliminated in the last few years, but the Government still sets the retail prices of petroleum products which have remained unchanged since late 1990. 4. External policies a. The exchange svstem Under the 1991 reform of the exchange system, the Dominican Republic established a unified exchange rate that was determined in the inter-bank market. L/ The system was maintained through 1993 with the Central Bank intervening frequently in the foreign exchange market to prevent the appre- ciation of the peso against the background of large capital inflows. How- ever, during the first nine months of 1994, the Central Bank sold reserves to support the peso in the face of a weakening of financial policies and capital outflows. Notwithstanding this intervention, the spread between the official and the inter-bank exchange rate, which was negligible by end-1993, widened to over 2 percent by end-August 1994. This has given rise to a multiple currency practice with traditional exports, credit cards proceeds, a few services, oil imports, and service payments on the public sector external debt carried at the official rate. As noted earlier, in early September 1994 the authorities devalued the official rate by about 3 percent and announced that it would be adjusted periodically in line with developments in the inter-bank market. .The measures brought some calm to the financial markets--international reserves and the inter-bank exchange rate stabilized--but the adjustment mechanism for the official rate was suspended after a few weeks of operation. In the discussions with the staff, the authorities were confident that the tighten- ing of financial policies would suffice to bring the inter-bank rate closer to the official rate. However, as of end-March 1995 the spread was 4.5 per- cent and it widened to about 6.5 percent after the recent wage increase announcements. Surrender requirements have been reduced substantially in recent years and only traditional exports, credit card proceeds, and a few services remain subject to these requirements. The authorities intend to conduct foreign exchange transactions directly in the market, once a money and foreign exchange desk is fully operational at the Central Bank. l-/ The 1991 reform of the exchange system is described in EBS/91/127. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - The Dominican Republic maintains exchange restrictions evidenced by the existence of external payments arrears and a restriction on profit remit- tances. As explained below, certain arrears have been cleared during 1994 and in early 1995 while others remain in dispute or under negotiation. Also, the elimination of the restriction on profit remittances is envisaged in the draft Foreign Investment,Law recently approved by the Deputies' Chamber and now subject to the Senate's approval. b. Trade policy Most tariff rates have remained in a range of 15 percent to 30 percent since the tariff reform of September 1990. An additional tariff premium introduced at that time was eliminated in September 1993. A tariff surcharge was reduced from 7 percent to 3 percent in June 1994 and will be eliminated in 1995. The tax on sales of foreign exchange was reduced from 2 percent to 1.5 percent in March 1994. However, the trade regime still involves a multiplicity of duty rates with peaks as high as 70 percent, and average rates higher than in many developing countries. The authorities recognized that the trade regime would have to be revised in light of the recent signing by the Dominican Government of the agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) (subject now to ratification by Congress). The existing import licensing mechanisms would have to be replaced by tariffs. Also, in light of the WTO's Customs Valua- tion Code, all tariffs will be applied to the transaction cost reflected in the importer's invoice and, thus, the existing custom valuation list would have to be eliminated. The introduction of new multilateral norms and disciplines following the Uruguay Round will adversely affect the preferential status accorded by industrial countries to countries like the Dominican Republic under various preferential arrangements. 1/ Though these measures will be implemented gradually (over a period of up to ten years) they would have a negative impact on tax revenue from international trade taxes. The staff stressed the importance of improving further the administration and collection of domestic taxes to offset this loss. C. External debt On February 14, 1994, the Dominican Republic signed an agreement with commercial bank creditors to restructure about USS1.1 billion of debt (US$780 million of principal and US$300 million of past due interest). The agreement was executed on August 30, 1994 and involved an up front payment Yl/ A clear example for the Dominican Republic is the elimination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement, a system of bilateral export restraint agreements that regulates textiles and clothing exports by developing countries to industrial markets. As a result, competition in the U.S. market for Dominican textiles and clothing exporters is likely to increase and the benefits currently receive.d under a special offshore assembly program between Caribbean nations and the United States are likely to be eroded. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - of US$172 million. The agreement included two options (a cash buyback of eligible debt, and the exchange of eligible principal remaining unpaid after the cash buyback through collateralized discount bonds), and set forth arrangements for clearing interest arrears. From May 1993 until the execu- tion date, the Dominican Republic made partial payments of US$750,000 a month which were credited against interest obligations falling due. At the end of 1994, the total outstanding external debt of the Dominican Republic (including Fund credit) amounted to USS3.9 billion of which about USSO. billion was overdue (Tables 6 and 7). During 1994 the Dominican Republic cleared its arrears to Argentina through a debt-buyback agreement and reached an agreement with the OPEC Special Fund for the restructuring of the overdue debt that has been presented to the Dominican Congress for ratification. Early in 1995, the Dominican Republic cleared its arrears to Paraguay and has recently reached an agreement with the Venezuelan Investment Fund for the restructuring of the overdue debt. Negotiations continue on restructuring agreements with Taiwan Province of China, and a few Japanese suppliers. Most arrears to Paris Club creditors also have been cleared with the exception of those to the CCC of the United States. The authorities explained that a long process of reconciliation of the amounts involved has delayed the resolution of this pending issue. They are seeking to reach a satisfactory and prompt settlement of these arrears. 5. Medium-term outlook The staff has prepared a revised balance of payments projection for the period through the year 2000 taking into account the assumptions contem- plated in the discussions and the latest World Economic Outlook projection of commodity prices. L/ The main assumptions underlying the revised medium-term projections are presented in Table 8. The prospects for 1995 and 1996 are for a further reduction in the current account deficit to less than 1 percent of GDP. Increases of most export prices (both of agricul- tural and mineral products) are projected for 1995 and the volume of exports also is expected to rise, helped by increased agricultural and mining out- put. Export earnings are expected to grow more slowly in 1996 and to fall in 1997 owing to less favorable export prices for the major commodities. The maintenance of prudent macroeconomic policies (including a cautious wage policy), continued growth in tourism and free trade zone receipts, a moderate inflow of capital, and a favorable outcome regarding the avail- ability of foreign financing to close the gap identified above (or a further tightening of fiscal policies) would permit the Dominican Republic to replenish somewhat its net international reserves, by about US$35 million in 1995 and US$SO million in 1996. Under this scenario, subsequent to 1996, net international reserves would increase by about US$77 million a year on 1/ However, the magnitude of the salary increases recently granted to workers in the public and the private sectors raises concerns regarding the feasibility of the medium-term outlook discussed with the authorities.

The Dominican Republic's balance of payments remains vulnerable to external shocks. Table 10 illustrates the sensitivity to a 1 percentage point reduction in the growth of exports, an increase in international oil prices of US$l a barrel per year, a 1 percentage point reduction in tourism receipts, a 1 percent point reduction in the growth of free trade zone earnings, and a 1 percentage point increase in external interest rates. These shocks would lead to a worse current account outcome compared to the baseline scenario, particularly in the case of higher oil prices and lower growth in tourism receipts. 6. Social indicators and the environment During recent years, the Dominican Republic has made progress in poverty alleviation and has developed plans to protect the environment. The execution of programs aimed at improving social and economic conditions has continued and several large infrastructure works have been completed in 1994. Also, the allocation of funds to social projects (particularly to health and education) has increased, water supply and sanitation systems for rural areas and small towns have been improved, and assistance programs for low income groups have been initiated. Funding from the World Bank and the IDB and grants from the European Community (under the Lome IV Agreement) have been allocated to these social projects. A recent study elaborated by a nonprofit private foundation (financed by a grant from the U.S. AID) concludes that income distribution and poverty indicators have improved markedly since the late 1980s. The study identified the stabilization policies that began to be implemented in mid-1989 and the continued expan- sion of the labor-intensive free trade zones and the tourism sector as the major contributors to this improvement. Regarding environmental issues, the authorities recognized weaknesses in the legal framework (with a multitude of seemingly contradictory regula- tions), and the institutional framework (with several agencies having responsibility for natural resources resulting in overlapping responsi- bilities and functions). They explained that key environmental issues are deforestation, degradation of the urban environment, and the impact of certain unplanned population settlements in the tourist areas that seem to be negatively affecting the coastal ecosystems. A National Environmental Action Plan has been elaborated with the assistance of UNDP to address these problems as well as to improve the management and preservation of river basins. A commission headed by the Vice President of the Republic was recently created to coordinate and supervise this plan. 7. Statistical issues The authorities have made efforts to resolve deficiencies in macro- economic and social statistics that pose difficulties for economic and social analysis and policy making. The revision of the National Accounts Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - statistics, being made with technical assistance from UNDP, is expected to be completed next year. As part of this project, the authorities have recently released revised GDP sectoral data (at constant prices) from 1980 onward that include output from the free trade zones and tourism (the most dynamic sectors that were excluded from official statistics before). The consumer price index has been revised to include a more updated basket of goods. Fiscal data from 1980 onward also have been thoroughly revised to provide more consistency and increased coverage incorporating net lending operations of certain government agencies and improved data on government expenditure. Also, the balance of payments statistics are being improved with technical assistance from the Fund. The opportunity of data provision to the Fund also has improved in recent years, but delays still persist regarding fiscal and balance of payments data. IV. Staff Appraisal In 1990 the Dominican Republic began implementing an economic program involving macroeconomic adjustment and a wide range of structural reforms. The program remained on track until late 1993 and succeeded in reducing inflation, promoting economic growth, and strengthening the balance of payments. At the same time, progress was made in re-establishing relations with external creditors. However, in 1994 financial policies weakened and structural reforms stalled, eroding confidence and giving rise to insta- bility in the financial markets. Since September 1994, the authorities have acted to move the official exchange rate closer to the market rate and have tightened credit and fiscal policies, thus helping to contain the loss of international reserves. However, in the view of the staff, achievement of macroeconomic stability and sustained growth in the medium term requires further fiscal consolida- tion. Improvements are required in the collection and administration of domestic taxes aimed at combating tax evasion, particularly in view of the possible losses in tariff revenue stemming from the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreement. While efforts to modernize the internal tax office, streamline the public administration, and improve expenditure control are welcomed and should be pursued vigorously, the staff encourages the authorities to consider increasing certain tax rates, in particular the value-added tax which is among the lowest in Latin America. They should also liberalize the domestic prices of oil derivatives, ensure competition in this market, and convert the oil tax to an ad valorem basis without delay. During the discussions the staff emphasized that a cautious wage policy in the public sector remained crucial for the restoration of a sustainable fiscal position and to send adequate signals to the private sector, thereby helping to preserve low inflation and external competitiveness. However, the magnitude of the recently announced wage increases raise doubts regard- ing the possibility of restoring a strong fiscal stance and creates concerns regarding economic growth, inflation, and the balance of payments outlook. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - The authorities are well advised to take promptly the additional fiscal measures that may be needed to offset the increased wage bill, ensuring the maintenance of a strong fiscal stance, and avoiding recourse to domestic financing. The staff welcomes the intention of the authorities to rationalize investment outlays in 1995 and would encourage them to prioritize projects, focusing on those projects that yield high returns and improve social and environmental conditions, while maintaining a careful control over capital expenditure. A well-designed investment program would facilitate access to foreign financing. Approval by Congress of legislation on foreign investment and the privatization of the electricity sector would permit the elimination of remaining restrictions on profit remittances, which would improve the investment environment and open the way for the participation of the private sector in the electricity sector, helping attract longer-term capital. The staff encourages the authorities to seek the divesture or privatization of the rest of state-owned enterprises, thereby strengthening fiscal perfor- mance and the efficiency of the economy. On monetary policy, the authorities are urged to continue efforts to improve monetary management and programming, as well as strengthen the financial position of the Central Bank and streamline its procedures and operations. The budget should absorb any losses that may result from the liquidation of failed financial institutions and the protection of depositors. Progress has been made in the modernization of the Superinten- dency of Banks, but a further strengthening of supervisory capabilities is called for in order to ensure the effective enforcement of prudential regulations and proper monitoring of the financial institutions. The recent presentation of the draft Monetary and Financial Code for Congressional approval is welcomed as it will consolidate reforms that have been imple- mented in recent years and will promote competition in the financial sector. Notwithstanding the devaluation of the peso in the official market in September 1994, a differential still persists with the inter-bank market which has further widened following the recently announced wage increases. The staff urges the authorities to promptly restore the more flexible arrangement that was announced in early September (but suspended subse- quently) , to support this arrangement with a strong fiscal stance and tight monetary policy, and to avoid multiple currency practices at all times. While the reform of the trade regime has been consolidated with the recent enactment of the new customs law, several modifications may have to be introduced mainly in light of the signing of the Uruguay Round Agreement. The authorities should revise the regulatory and legislative framework, identify reforms that may be needed for the implementation of the commit- ments assumed, and elaborate the specific arrangements that the Dominican Republic would be able to propose for the transitional period contemplated under the WTO. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - The staff welcomes the significant efforts made by the Dominican Republic toward normalizing relations with foreign creditors, as evidenced by the execution of the debt-restructuring agreement with commercial bank creditors, and the clearing of most pending arrears with Paris Club and other official bilateral creditors. In this regard, the authorities are encouraged to complete ongoing negotiations for the elimination of remaining arrears and clarify existing disputes in order to clear any pending obliga- tion as soon as possible, while making every effort to avoid the accumula- tion of new arrears. Considering that the new foreign investment law currently under discus- sion by the Dominican Congress, and expected to be approved soon, would eliminate the exchange restrictions arising from the limitations on some profit remittances, the staff recommends the temporary approval for the retention of these restrictions by the Dominican Republic. In summary, after a weakening of policies in 1994 that had adverse effects on economic performance, the authorities engaged in actions to regain momentum in their adjustment efforts. However, the success of these efforts could be jeopardized by the recent wage increases. Moreover, these efforts need to be supported by fiscal consolidation, a flexible exchange rate policy, and the continuation of structural reforms. This will help restore conditions for sustained growth and a viable balance of payments, and will provide the basis for the continued support of the international financial community as has been the case in recent years. It is recommended that the Dominican Republic remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - V. Proposed Decision The following draft decision is proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the Dominican Republic's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, in light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with the Dominican Republic conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance Over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. The Dominican Republic maintains exchange restrictions in the form of limitations on some profit remittances. The Fund encourages the Dominican Republic to eliminate these practices as soon as possible. In the meantime, the Fund grants approval for the retention by the Dominican Republic of the restrictions on some profit remittances until May 31, 1996, or the completion of the next Article IV consultation with the Dominican Republic, whichever is earlier.
