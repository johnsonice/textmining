These developments reflected rapid growth of exports (spurred on by productivity growth and progress in restructuring) and weak domestic demand owing to sizable fiscal adjustment and tight credit. l Growth was sustained in the first half of 1995 as the continued strength of exports carried over into domestic demand. Financial policies remained tight, and inflation declined further. l Progress in restructuring reflects reforms introduced in earlier years and hard budget constraints as a result of tight financial policies. However, political instability and administrative constraints have recently contributed to delays in implementing structural reform. l While Slovakia met the performance criteria at end-1994, completion of the review under the (precautionary) SBA has been delayed by slow formulation of structural policies and, more recently, an unexpected shift in privatization policy. In June 1995, the Government decided to cancel the second-wave voucher scheme; to distribute "privatization bonds" (valued at the equivalent of 8 percent of GDP) to the population; and to maintain state ownership or control in a large number of enterprises. Policv issues l The discussions focussed on the proper stance of financial policies to consolidate last year's favorable developments, and on the need to reinvigorate the process of structural reform. l Risk of economic overheating reflecting the expansionary effect from the expected issuance of the privatization bonds in conjunction with (a) rapid recovery of domestic demand and (b) a large swing of the fiscal accounts in the latter half of 1995 as expenditure controls are relaxed. a In the area of structural reform, the key issue was the impact of the recent policy shift on the pace of privatization. Staff nosition l Tightening of financial policies is called for to prevent overheating of the economy. This should be best achieved by adopting a more ambitious fiscal target for 1995, an approach that the Government was reluctant to adopt. The staff welcomes the monetary authorities' intention to tighten credit conditions but notes that it is a second-best solution with adverse consequences for growth.

There is a serious risk that the recent slowdown, and backtracking, in the privatization process will impede future growth. l The authorities should limit the role of the state in "strategic" enterprises--for which state control but not ownership is officially envisaged--strictly in compliance with the existing commercial code and announce plans to privatize such enterprises. The Government would thereby reassure the market about its market orientation, permit an acceleration of the privatization process, and secure the financial position of the agency responsible for servicing the privatization bonds. l The staff envisages resuming discussions on completion of the review under the SBA once the authorities have defined policies that would provide a basis for reinvigoration of the privatization process and address the fiscal implications of the privatization bonds.

Introduction On July 22, 1994, the Executive Board concluded the 1994 Article IV consultation, and approved a 20-month stand-by arrangement (SBA) for SDR 115.8 million (45 percent of quota) as well as a second purchase under the Systemic Transformation Facility (STF) for SDR 64.35 million (25 percent of quota). Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation were initiated during January 18-February 1 and completed during July 6-14, 1995 in a subsequent visit to Bratislava. u While Slovakia met the program's performance criteria for end-December 1994, the review under the SBA has been delayed by slow formulation of structural policies and, more recently, an unexpected shift in privatization policy. 2/ The authorities have requested resumption of the discussidns for completion of the review later this year. At the conclusion of the 1994 Article IV consultation with the Slovak Republic (EBM/94/67, 7/22/94), Executive Directors commended the authorities for their efforts in coping with the task of building a new state while simultaneously managing the transition to a market economy; and for strengthening confidence in the economy through progress in addressing the macroeconomic imbalances. However, they expressed concern about the slow pace of structural reform after independence. Elections at end-September 1994 led to the return to power of Mr. MeEiar who had been Prime Minister from mid-1992 to March 1994. On December 13, 1994--after having being unable to reach agreement with other parties--Mr. MeEiar formed a majority coalition government with the rightist Slovak National Party and the leftist Workers' Association Party. 1;/ The Slovak representatives included Vice Premier and Finance Minister Kozlik, Economy Minister Duclj, Labor and Social Affairs Minister KeltoZSova, Privatization Minister Bisak, National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) Governor Masar and Vice-Governor Jusko, State Secretaries of Finance Autner and Magula, and other senior officials of the Slovak Government. An earlier mission (December 7-15, 1994) assisted in the preparation of a draft budget and of the monetary program for 1995. Staff members who participated on missions to Bratislava at various times included Messrs. Zervoudakis (Head), Marrese, Sukselainen, Odenius, Monroe (all EU), Anayiotos and Brooks (both PDR), and Mrs. Ricasa (Administrative Assistant, EUl). Mr. Georgiou (Fund Resident Representative) worked closely with the visiting missions. The January mission collaborated on structural reform issues with an overlapping World Bank mission led by Mr. Singh (EC2CO). Mr. Rig&z, Assistant to the Executive Director for the Slovak Republic, attended most discussions. 2/ The first phased purchase under the SBA was made as scheduled upon observance of performance criteria at end-September 1994. Availability of the next purchase depends on end-1994 performance criteria that were comfortably obsenred, and on the first review under the SBA that was originally due by mid-February.

Its outstanding use of Fund resources was SDR 379.2 million (147.3 percent of quota) on June 30, 1995. Against the background of a favorable balance of payments position, the authorities indicated their intention not to make further purchases under the SM. Relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II, respectively. II. &acknround Over the past eighteen months, Slovakia's economic performance was considerably better than programmed in spite of political instability that slowed and indeed jeopardized the pace of structural reform. Macroeconomic performance was quite good: real GDP rose by 5 percent in 1994, inflation was halved to 12 percent, the external current account swung into a surplus equivalent to 6 percent of GDP, and official foreign reserves more than doubled to reach the equivalent of 3 months of imports of goods and services by year-end (Table 1 and Charts l-3). Financial policy targets, including all performance criteria, were also comfortably observed in 1994. The economic turnaround was apparently sustained in the first half of 1995 with continued growth, lower inflation and unemployment rates, and a further rise in official reserves. Political developments and administrative constraints, however, have caused further slippages in implementing structural reforms and delayed completion of the first review under the SBA. Privatization lagged as the new Government adopted a strategy that differed from that of its predecessor, and prospects for a quicker pace. of privatization were diminished in June by the Government's decision to cancel the second-wave voucher scheme and to maintain state ownership or control in a large number of enterprises. Banking reform, including adoption of improved loan classification and provisioning standards, was delayed from late 1994, although key steps have been taken in recent months. In the area of trade reform, the authorities have been reluctant to remove the 10 percent import surcharge, and final elimination is now delayed by 18 months to mid-1996. The key elements of Slovakia's recent economic performance are: a . A surge in extorts. Exports increased by 20 percent in volume terms in 1994 as enterprises-- in the midst of transformation and adjustment --capitalized on a favorable external environment (5-6 percent growth of foreign markets). Exports to OECD countries (one third of Slovakia's exports in 1993) rose by over 40 percent in volume, while exports to the Czech Republic stopped declining and those to the rest of the world rose by about 15 percent. Exports grew steadily throughout 1994, and their volume in January-May 1995 was about 20 percent higher than a year earlier. Although a low initial level of exports, as well as demand conditions at home and abroad, explain a good deal of Slovakia's export performance, this Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public56 56 54 52 M 48 46 44 42 4C -3- CHART1 SIDVAK REPUBLIC REAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS, 1991 - 1995 56 Real GDP (In billions of koruny. 1964 prices) 56 -54 -52 .M . 48 - 46 - 44 '. .' . ...' - 42 .lMU I I II III IV I II III IV I II In IV 1 n m IV 140 1991 1992 1993 1994 A 140 140 Total Industrial Production (Constant prices, 1991=100) no- - 130 120 . - 120 - 110 70 - : ,' : : - 70 . . *n(u . 60 "'I"'~"".""..."'..'."...."......'.."..,."- JAN APR JUL OCT JAN APR l&L OCT JAN APR JUL OCT 1991 1993 JAN APR & OCT JAN lg9Asp; ” 16 16 Unemployment Rate (In percent) ,*---...m 14 . _... - -. -..- _..------..____/-- .P-4 =. -... ,.-- _...--- *-.. . 14 -. ,.-----.~~ .' 12 - #.. =.. /.--_..- _ 12 ,' 2' ~-----____ 10 . ,' ----A____.. ,..- ,;' . 10 6. ,,*' ,.** -0 , 6- ,,*' -6 .' ,' 4. ,' /' -4 ,' .' .' 2. -2 Undk o',"'."",."""".*...,'........................._ JAN APR JUL OCT JAN APR JUL MT JAN APR JUL 0’3 JAN APR JUL OCT ’ 1991 JAN 1992 1993 1994 1g9AgPR Sources: Slovak authorities and IMP staff estimates.

Private consumption declined by 2 percent reflecting the modest recovery of real wages, a further decline in employment, and the sizable fiscal retrenchment which mainly took the form of lower net transfers. Fixed investment stagnated as a result of the slow pace of structural reform, political uncertainty, relatively high interest rates, and cautious bank lending. Preliminary data for the first half of 1995 point to a stronger-than-expected recovery of domestic demand led by nongovernment consumption and, especially, investment; retail sales and imports were, respectively, about 8 percent and 20 percent higher in volume than a year earlier. The fiscal deficit was reduced by 6 percentage points to 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 (against a target of 4 percent of GDP). With nominal expenditures slightly higher than projected on account of extrabudgetary operations, this outcome was made possible by higher direct taxes owing to the stronger than expected economic activity, The good fiscal performance continued into the first half of 1995, when general government operations showed a surplus equivalent to 2 percent of annual GDP, as spending was held below budgeted amounts through control of discretionary expenditures. &/ A faster than targeted rise in broad money during 1994 (18 l/2 percent against a target of 10 l/2 percent) was consistent with increased demand for financial assets and stemmed entirely from a rise in net foreign assets (NFA) of the banking system.. Net domestic assets (NDA) of the banking system declined by 1 l/2 percent during l994, compared with a programmed 5 percent increase.

Notwith- standing continued foreign exchange inflows, broad money grew by only 3 percent during the first half of 1995 owing, in part, to the fiscal surplus and sterilization by the NBS. C. Bn increase in economic activit s ye1atInflation. On the supply side, the export surge in 1994 was made possible by a 7 percent rise in industrial output-- reversing a continuous contraction since the late 1980s--as well as weak domestic demand. u Despite the increase in output, however, employment declined by almost 2 percent in 1994, and the unemployment rate peaked around 15 percent. A weakening of economic activity in the second half of’ 1994 appears to have been short- lived: information on the first half of 1995 points to a strong rise in industrial output (up 6 percent from a year ago) and a decline in the unemployment rate to 13.3 Ipercent at end-May 1995 (Chart 1). Financial restraint ensured progress toward price stability: the 12-month rate of inflation declined, as programmed, to 12 percent in December 1994, down from 215 percent a year earlier. However, as the 1993 inflation rate incorporated the effects of the VAT introduction and the currency devaluation, the decline in the underlying rate of inflation was considerably smaller, probably 3-4 percentage points. Prices rose by only 3 percent during,the first 6 months of l995, reducing the 12-month rate to 10 l/2 percent in June. d. 4 strenntheninP of the externrtl Dosi tion . With surging exports and stagnant imports, the current account balance recorded a surplus of 6 percent of GDP (USSO. billion) in 1994, representing a swing of 11 percentage points from the previous year. The capital account surplus was lower than targeted, reflecting a shortfall in official financing and an accumulation of claims under the payments agreement with the Czech Republic. u Overall, the balance of payments recorded a surplus of USS1.4 billion in 1994, USSO. billion higher than programmed, and official foreign reserves rose to USS2.2 billion (3 months of imports of goods and services). Foreign reserves strengthened further during the first half of 1995; however, the trade account --though still in a small surplus-- deteriorated on a seasonally adjusted basis, as import growth appears to I/ The increase in output was more pronounced in export-oriented industries (mainly chemicals, basic metals, and paper), while construction output declined by 1 l/2 percent and the services sector remained buoyant. u In particular, delays in disbursement of financial assistance by the G-24 and of project loans by international financial institutions. At a G-24 pledging session on July 15, 1994, !ilovakia received commitments equivalent to US$240 million in the form of balance of payments assistance in 1994-95 (evenly distributed between the two years). Against these commitments, disbursements were nil in 1994 and are expected to amount to US$70 million in 1995.

Setbacks in structural reform Dolicies. Reflecting the strong start of the reform process under the federation, large gains were made in economic transformation as indicated by the export-led recovery and the increase in the private sector's contribution to GDP to almost 60 percent in 1994. Specifically, the early reforms and tight financial policies imposed hard budget constraints on enterprises and fostered adjustment at the micro level. However, these gains are being jeopardized by recent setbacks in structural reform policies. Political developments, in particular, contributed to delays in privatization. The second--and final--wave of large-scale privatization was initiated in 1993 and involved enterprises valued at about Sk 260 billion (US$8 l/2 billion). u The authorities' objective under the program was to privatize one third of the remaining (as of early 1993) majority state-owned enterprises by mid-1995, i.e., enterprises valued at Sk 95 billion. As in the first wave, they were to use standard methods (direct sales, stock market sales, and public tenders) as well as the voucher scheme. Mr. MoravEik's Government started the second-wave voucher scheme in September 1994 with the sale of voucher books to 3.5 million Slovaks at a nominal price, as was the case also in the first wave of voucher privati- zation. However, the new Government initially postponed and, in June 1995, unexpectedly decided to cancel the second-wave voucher scheme. To that end, the National Property Fund (NPF) will distribute bonds to the population-- valued at Sk 35 billion, equivalent to 8 percent of GDP--in exchange for the voucher books (see section III.1 below for the financial implications). Meanwhile, privatization via standard has been relatively slow despite increased effort in 1994, and the value of enterprises privatized since early.1993 was about 40 percent of the program target for mid-1995. 2/ Furthermore, recent legislation regarding "strategic" enterprises is likely to prevent the acceleration of the privatization process envisaged under the program (see section 111.3). u By comparison, enterprises valued at Sk 170 billion (US$5 l/2 billion) were included in the first wave of large-scale privatization which was largely completed under the federation (1991-92). The NPF still maintains small shareholdings in a large number of them--and a majority of shares in enterprises valued at about Sk 15 billion. u The book value of enterprises privatized amounted to Sk 10 billion in 1993, Sk 24 billion in 1994, and Sk 5 billion in January-June 1995. Enterprises are considered privatized when at least 51 percent of the shares are in private ownership and the size of an enterprise is measured by the book value of equity.

ReDort on Po1ic.v Discussions The recent shift in prLvatizat1on policy, together with uncertainties about financial policies in the period ahead, complicated the completion of the scheduled review under the SBA. Against this background, the discussions focussed on the stance of financial policies that might conso- lidate last year's favorable developments, and on the need to reinvigorate the process of structural reform. 1. Bacroeconomic nolicit3s The authorities were generally pleased with the gains in stabilization, and their main objective for 1995 was to progress further by sustaining high growth, reducing inflation to single-digit level, and achieving full current account convertibility. However, they were concerned that output growth-- concentrated in the export-oriented sector --was unbalanced and unemployment remained uncomfortably high. In these circumstances, the authorities envisaged increased public spending to help depressed sectors (e.g., construction) and improve public infrastructure. However, they realized the importance of keeping spending commitments ?within the limits set by broader macroeconomic considerations. Given Slovakia's short track record, the authorities also wished to avotd the impression of a break with the financially prudent policies of the past two years. Regarding the macroeconomic outlook, there was agreement that, with broadly unchanged financial policies, domestic demand would firm and replace exports as the main source of output growth in 1995. Data for early 1995 were consistent with this expectation: after contracting last year--mainly because of the large fisca:l retrenchment--private consumption appeared to be recovering with rising activity and incomes. Enterprise investment for modernization and expansion, especially in the export-oriented sector, was increasing in response to higher output and retained earnings over the past year. The contribution of the foreign balance to output growth,'on the other hand, was likely to decline--and probably turn negative--as export growth would eventually decelerate (reflecting, in part, capacity constraints in some sectors and increased domestic absorption of exportables) and as imports picked up from low levels (as indicated by trade data). The financial policy targets for 1995 --compatible with the aim of reducing inflation to .single digits --envisioned a slightly higher fiscal deficit (3 percent of GDP) in 1995, and more normal credit conditions with lower nominal interest rates and a faster rise of credit to enterprises. The exchange rate, an important nominal anchor, seemed broadly appropriate for the time being. The current account surplus was expected to diminish in 1995, reflecting a recovery in domestic demand in 1995 and the projected domestic-foreign inflation differential. In any case, the strength of the external position was a relatively recent phenomenon, dating only from the second quarter of 1994.

Noting that the scheme effectively constituted a fiscal transfer to the population, the staff called for adoption of a more ambitious fiscal target based on expenditure cuts of about 1-l l/2 percent of GDP in 1995, even though it recognized that the bonds would not be distributed until January 1996 and that there were limitations on their use. 1/ Moreover, fiscal tightening was required by the strengthening of domestic demand and the additional pressures expected to result, with unchanged policies, from the unusually large swing of the fiscal balance in the second half of 1995 into a deficit equivalent to 5 percent of annual GDP. u Concerned about these risks to financial stability, the monetary authorities adopted more restrictive credit targets (implying lower credit to enterprises) in place of fiscal correction, even though this may have adverse consequences on real interest rates and growth. They also indicated their intention to tighten credit conditions further as needed. The authorities envisage that their financial and exchange rate policies will support a 5-6 percent growth rate, decrease the inflation rate to 8 percent, and raise official foreign reserves to USS3.3 billion (3.6 months of imports) by end-1995. I/ The staff argued that the population was likely to feel wealthier even before the bonds were distributed and that the limitations on their use would not significantly reduce their liquidity. The bonds --equivalent in value to 8 percent of annual GDP and 12 percent of broad money--will be transferable, repayable in cash in 5 years, and pay market-related interest. They may be used, inter alia, for settlement of liabilities to the NPF (including by secondary market purchasers), and for downpayments on apartment purchases. The inflationary effect stems, in part, from the fact that the market value of the shares that the population would have acquired through the voucher scheme does not probably exceed one half of the face value of the bonds. 2/ This is expected to occur given that the annual fiscal deficit is still projected at 3 percent of GDP in 1995, and that the authorities intend to lift the controls on expenditures in the second half of 1995.

The fiscal deficit is projected at 3 percent of GDP in 1995, which is 1 percent less than the target, but 1 1,/2 percent higher than the outturn, for 1994 (Table 2). Overall, the projections imply bank borrowing by the general government of about 2 l/2 percent of GDP. The deficit is consistent with a small primary surplus and a reduction of the (gross) government debt/GDP ratio--which stood at one third at end-1994--over the medium term. JJ This assessment, however, depends on the assumption that the current estimate of quasi-fiscal deficits --most notably on account of bad debt in banks' portfolio-- is broadly accurate (section 111.4) and that the NPF's financial position will remain healthy (section 111.3). In response to staff concerns regarding the high revenue and expenditure to GDP ratios (over 50 percent), the authorities pointed to the progress already made in limiting the role of the! Government, noting in particular that the ll-percentage point decline in the underlying fiscal deficit between 1992 and 1994 had been almost entirely achieved through a reduction in the expenditure/GDP ratio. They also noted that socioeconomic conditions --a rise in long-term unemployment, and low and only moderately u Net government debt was equivalent to 7 percent of GDP at end-1994. However, the bulk of government assets consists of claims on countries with debt servicing problems.

Specifically, the authorities intend to streamline the social safety net (by reducing the number of available social benefits and targeting them better) through legislation to be adopted by early 1996. However, they have cited demographic (relatively low life expectancy for Slovak men) and social reasons for their reluctance to raise the retirement age, Monetarv policy .is geared to reducing inflation to single digits, within the context of a fixed exchange rate. It envisages a 12 percent increase in broad money during 1995, consistent with a small increase in velocity. The expected distribution of privatization bonds, which are substitutes of household deposits with banks, is likely to decrease the demand for broad money. Given a projected rise in banking system NFA of USSO. billion, the targeted liquidity growth implies a rise in banking system NDA of 3 percent during 1995 (Table 3). Credit to enterprises and households would rise by 4 l/2 percent during 1995 compared with 2 percent last year. In line with progress in reducing inflation, the NBS lowered the discount rate to 11 percent in mid-March--from 12 percent, set in late 1993--triggering a response from commercial banks (Chart 5). JJ The NBS intends to complete the transition to reliance on indirect instruments of monetary policy in the course of this year. In preparation for this step, the NBS has supplemented bank-specific ceilings with indirect instruments over the. past two years, and abolished ceilings on all but five major commercial banks as of October 1994. On a phased basis, the NBS intends to abolish the remaining bank-specific ceilings with the exception of ceilings on two banks (the Savings Bank and the Consolidation Bank), which will remain in effect so as to promote competition and restructuring within the banking sector and for prudential reasons. 2;/ With assistance from the Fund, the NBS has been developing its capacity for open market L/ Deposit and lending rates have been relatively unresponsive to changes in banks' liquidity (as reflected in interbank rates) and general market conditions since early 1994, thus discouraging enterprise borrowing and contributing to under-utilization of bank-specific ceilings (Chart 5). This phenomenon is largely attributable to the practice of banks (especially the Savings Bank, the dominant deposit-taker) of setting deposit and lending rates on the basis of the NBS discount rate even though the discount facility has become insignificant. 2J The credit ceiling on the Savings Bank, which accounts for one half of total deposits but less than 20 percent of bank loans, is intended to promote competition within the banking system and prevent imprudent lending. The ceiling on the Consolidation Bank is in line with the authorities' intention to convert this bank into a work-out agency for bad loans.

The Government discontinued selective mee controbg that were in effect in the second half of 1994. These were aimed at limiting wages in loss- making enterprises as well as enterprises in the energy and financial sectors. The Government's decision reflected trade union opposition, concerns about allocational inefficiencies, and an assessment that wage growth in 1994 (and early this year) had been moderate. The wage restraint was attributed to hard budget constraints on enterprises rather than the effectiveness of wage controls. Nevertheless, the Government intends to adopt corrective measures should there be evidence of excessive wage increases. Despite the marked improvement in the outlook, the uncertainties remain considerable. Given the relatively short track record and uncertainties in the market about the Government's policy intentions, an adverse shift in expectations could not be ruled out. It is also possible that export growth may continue at a rapid pace even as domestic demand rises, thereby generating inflationary pressures. In light of these risks, the authorities indicated their preparedness to adapt their stance on credit policy in consultation with the staff. 2. External sector issues and medium-term outlook Encouraged by the strengthened external position, the authorities confirmed their intention to introduce current account convertibility and accept the obligations of Article VIII by January 1, 1996. In preparation for this step, several measures have been taken or are being implemented. 2/ The staff encouraged the Slovak authorities to eliminate outstanding restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction before accepting the u Auctions of refinance credits, once the main instrument of injecting liquidity, have been suspended since mid-1994, when the NBS' principal task shifted to sterilizing inflows of foreign exchange. Since then and until recently, the NBS had to rely on government debt issues (securitfzed "old" NBS loans) whose timing and terms, however, it could not control. 2/ A new foreign exchange law is to be approved in September 1995, the travel allowance for travel abroad was doubled to US$l,OOO per person per year on July 1, 1995, and the bilateral payments agreement with the Czech Republic is expected to be eliminated in October 1995. Effective May 19, 1995 the NBS revalued the Slovak koruna by 4 percent under the bilateral payments agreement, thereby erasing most of Slovakia's 5 percent devaluation vis-a-vis the Czech koruna in December 1993. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - obligations of Article VIII. u The authorities also indicated their intention to relax restrictions on the capital account; however, the scope and timing of these measures were still under study. Slovakia's imoort svstem is relatively free of restrictions, with an average import tariff of 6 percent. In March 1994, while the external position was still weak, the Government introduced a 10 percent surcharge on imports of consumer goods that was to be eliminated by end-1994. The new Government has rescinded this latter decision, however; they now envisage eliminating it only by mid,-1996. They 'were, inter alia, concerned about the effects on the balance of payments of envisaged modifications to the clearing account with the Czech Republic, but also of the effects on the budget of early elimination of the surclharge (its annual yield is estimated at 0.7 percent of GDP). Considering the continued strength of the external position, the staff regretted the authorities' decision to continue the import surcharge beyond end-1994 and urged that Lt be phased out by end- 1995. Regarding the medium term it was agreed that continued high (4-5 percent) growth and further progress toward price stability are feasible provided that there is no departure from the current stance of prudent financial policies; current market concerns are resolved through a clarification of the Government's intentions; and accelerated structural reform encourages investment and enhances efficiency (Tables 4-6). With such policies, the investment/GDP ratio could return to historical levels, while the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) could be expected to continue to decline. This is expected to be matched by higher national savings, reflecting in part a steady rise in government savings. The external outlook has considerably improved since the SBA was approved, reflecting the strong export performance and rapid growth of foreign reserves during 1994. u The envisaged recovery in domestic demand would shift the external current account from sizable surpluses in 1994-95 into a broadly balanced position over the medium term. Foreign investment is expected to pick up as structural reform accelerates, particularly privatization. Official foreign reserves are projected to 1/ Slovakia maintains a number of restrictions on payments and transfers for current transactions under the transitional provisions of Article XIV. These include limits on the amount of foreign exchange that can be purchased by natural resident persons for current account payments; restrictions on the transferability by nonresidents of the proceeds of current payments (such as wages) from koruna-denominated .accounts; and restrictions on the availability of foreign exchange for the payment of interest to nonresidents on koruna-denominated short-term bonds. In addition, the payments agreement with the Czech Republic, in effect since February 1993, gives rise to a multiple currency practice that is subject to approval under Article VIII. a/ This was reflected in Moody's sovereign credit rating of Slovakia as Baa3 (investment grade) in May 1994.

External debt/GDP and debt service ratios are relatively low (32 percent and 9 percent, respectively) and declining over the medium term. 3. Privatization The authorities intend to rely henceforth entirely on standard methods --in contrast with the emphasis up to now on both voucher and standard methods. This is to ensure that effective control of enterprises is transferred to clearly defined owners. They explained that the first- wave voucher scheme had often resulted in dispersed ownership structure and ineffective governance of privatized enterprises. The authorities envisage a role for foreign investment, mainly in the form of joint ventures that convey technological and management know-how. The staff is concerned that ambitious privatization targets were rendered unrealistic by recent policy changes. In March 1995, the authorities announced their intention to privatize enterprises valued at Sk 60 billion (US$2 billion) during May-September 1995 solely through standard methods so as to achieve the original program target by end- September 1995, i.e., with a 3-month delay; and to privatize additional enterprises valued at Sk 20 billion by end-1995. However, in June 1995, the Government announced its decision (incorporated in legislation passed in July) to maintain ownership or control in a large number of enterprises. Specifically, the state is to retain full ownership in 29 "important" enterprises with a total book value of over Sk 100 billion (US$3 l/2 billion), including big utilities and "armaments and machinery" firms; the latter (book value of Sk 10 billion) and some of the utilities had been slated until then for privatization. u In addition, the state will retain (or regain) veto power over "key decisions" in 45 "strategic" industrial enterprises, with a total book value of Sk 110 billion, some of which have been privatized already. u The staff argued that the targets were unrealistic in light of Slovakia's experience thus far with privatization through standard methods, persisting technical constraints, and the legislation on state presence in selected enterprises. Besides jeopardizing financial stability, the shift I/ By comparison, state assets included in both waves of large-scale privatization have an estimated book value of Sk 450 billion. Of these, enterprises with a total book value of Sk 120 billion have been already privatized. 2/ The exercise of ownership rights for all enterprises in the two lists will be shifted from the NPF to the founding Ministries; this could adversely affect privatization prospects for "strategic" enterprises which are still officially slated for privatization. Investor interest in these enterprises was also likely to decline, were they to be offered for privatization, with adverse implications for privatization revenue.

The staff encouraged the authorities to clarify their plans regarding state presence in selected enterprises by limiting the role of the state in strategic enterprises so as to strictly comply with the existing commercial code and by announcing plans to privatize strategic enterprises. u Privatization of strategic enterprises was essential to accelerate the overall privati- zation process (otherwise, privatization sales during May-December 1995 are unlikely to exceed Sk 25 billion), and to allay concerns about the Government's market orientation and the financial viability of the NPF, which will be responsible for servicing the privatization bonds. 2/ The authorities anticipated that decisions regarding the privatization of a few strategic enterprises could be made in the coming months. Legislation adopted in July 1995 enhances transparency tn the capital markets, strengthens the regulatory framework for Investment Privatization Funds (IPFs), and limits thieir role in enterprise governance. u The authorities believed that the IPFs--managed by investment companies that cannot be challenged because of dispersed ownership--often interfered needlessly in enterprise management through inexperienced representatives, engaged in anti-competitive actions through their participation in the management boards of many enterprises, used inside information in trading shares, and had made difficult-to-meet promi.ses to uninformed investors. The curtailed role of the IPFs was consistent, in their view, with the increased emphasis on standard methods and with practices in Western countries (especially the United States) with regard to mutual funds. While welcoming the authorities' intentions with respect to improved transparency and strengthened regulations on the IPFs, World Bank and Fund staff expressed concern that the envisaged legislation would limit the role L/ The staff recommended that state involvement in corporate management should be based only on the extent of its shareholding in a company: the state should be able to use its veto power to block key decisions explicitly specified in the commercial code only if it still owns 34 percent of the company shares. u The NPF--recipient of privatization proceeds and owner of shares in a large number of enterprises-- is not included in the definition of the general government. The NPF revenues are mainly used to cover costs related to the privatization process and financial restructuring of viable enterprises. Prior to the Government's decision to issue privatization bonds, the NPF was expected to remain in broad financial balance in the coming years based on recent revenue performance and existing expenditure commitments. 2/ An amendment to the Securities Act introduced stricter monitoring procedures and disclosure requirements. An amendment to the Investment Funds Act restricted the voting rights of "first-wave" IPFs (thus requiring a larger number of IPFs to combine forces in order to exercise effective control of an enterprise), and introduced transparency and limits on fees charged by the investment companies managing the funds.

Furthermore, Western practices on mutual funds--adopted in response to special historical circumstances--are not necessarily appropriate for Slovakia where properly regulated IPFs could play a constructive role in enterprise governance. 4. BankinP- reform and other structural issues As of end-1994, about one third of bank claims on enterprises and households experienced debt servicing delays. However, Slovak banks have accumulated sizable loan-loss provisions and reserves, and have been able to collateralize their loans to a significant degree over the last several years. u According to a study prepared by the NBS and an international consulting company (McKinsey), if the three largest banks are allowed to provision for bad loans with before-tax proflts, they should be able to recapitalize themselves without outside resources. 2/ The NBS adopted regulations on loan classification and loan-loss provisioning in accordance with international practice effective July 1, 1995. Banks may be granted up to three years to comply fully with the provisioning requirements. Tax deductibility for loan-loss provisioning by banks--which was to be introduced in late 1994 under the program--has yet to be introduced, primarily because of the Finance Ministry's fiscal concerns. The authorities indicated that related legislation would be submitted to Parliament in September and would take effect in January 1996. In addition, restructuring and privatization plans for the two major banks (that are still majority state-owned) were currently under development. Besides continued reliance on hard budget constraints and measures in the area of privatization and banking reform, the authorfties envisaged changes in the existing legal framework to facilitate enterprise restructuring. So far, little progress has been made with regard to the enactment and implementation of effective bankruptcy procedures. A revised bankruptcy law became effective in June 1993 but has yet to be effectively implemented, reflecting both technical flaws in the law and an overburdened (as well as inexperienced) judicial system. The staff noted with concern that energy prices for households, unchanged from late 1993, are substantially subsidized, and that the 1/ Actual provisions and reserves were estimated at 55 percent of the "recommended" level at end-1994 (the latter calculated before taking into account loan collateral). Once collateral is factored in, the recommended loan-loss provisions should be significantly lower. 2/ Of these, the Savings Bank is a state-owned jotnt-stock company, the General Credit Bank (VUB) has been partially (less than 50 percent) privatized, and the Investment and Development Bank (IRB) has been fully privatized.

The authorities indicated that a phased pl.an to adjust prices was being considered. IV. Statistical Issues Immediately after independence in 1993, statistical problems seriously impeded economic analysis, not least because of the difficulty in compiling separate macroeconomic accounts for Slovakia in the pre-independence period (Appendix III). Since then considerable progress has been made, reflecting in part technical assistance from the Fund and other agencies. Problems, however, remain with regard to the national accounts and the balance of payments (short-term capital flows), while consolidated accounts of the general government have not become offi.cially available yet. Data are generally available on a timely basis. V. Staff ADDoraisal The turnaround in Slovakia's macroeconomic performance has been impressive. Led by unexpectedly rapid growth of exports (spurred by the 1993 devaluation, increased productivity and progress in restructuring), output rebounded strongly, the external current account swung into a sizable surplus, and the official :foreign exchange reserves reached relatively comfortable levels; meanwhile, inflation was reduced sharply to just over 10 percent. While many factors contributed, the economic turnaround is surely partly due to the determined fas:hion with which the authorities have stabilized the economy. These policies, together with the reform policies adopted in earlier years, imposed hard budget constraints on enterprises and led to the rebound that is now underway. The authorities' record of financial prudence unfortunately contrasts with a slow implementatton of structural reform policies over the past two years. Concerns in this area are further intensified by the recent shift in privatization policy which risks jeopardizing financial stability, involves setbacks in structural refolrm, and weakens market confidence in government policies. Only with further progress on inflation and in strengthening market confidence can the Slovak authorities look forward to enhanced prospects for investment and growth on sustainable basis. There are already signs that the strength of exports is carrying over into domestic demand to a larger extent than earlier anticipated. This will be compounded in the second half of the year by the expected issuance of the privatization bonds and the unusually large swing of the fiscal accounts in the second half-year. A tightening of financial policies would thus seem to be called for to prevent overheating of the economy, which would put at risk earlier stabilization gains. This should be best achieved by adopting a more ambitious fiscal target for 1995 based on expenditure cuts, an approach that the Government has been reluctant to adopt. The staff welcomes the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - monetary authorities' intention to tighten credit conditions but notes that it is a second-best solution with adverse consequences on growth. The deterioration in the financial position of the NPF, which will be responsible for servicing the privatization bonds, also calls for keeping the fiscal deficit under close control in the coming years. In addition, the fiscal accounts will need to allow for increasing structural reform costs. To that end,' the authorities should make further progress toward a more efficient government by reducing the relatively high expenditure/GDP ratio so as to release real resources to the nongovernment sector. This will require reform of the social safety net and of the system of government services, including health and education. The authorities have made only a modest start in these areas. Progress with privatization is essential in order to enhance economic efficiency, restore market confidence, and encourage domestic and foreign investment. The staff sees a serious risk that the recent slowdown, and backtracking, in the privatization process could impede future growth. The Government's decision to cancel the voucher scheme and to rely entirely on standard methods has already delayed the privatization process. Moreover, the adoption of recent legislation-- introducing permanent state ownership or control in a large number of enterprises --prompts concerns in this regard and dampens investor interest in these enterprises should they be offered for privatization under current conditions. Recent legislation to strengthen regulation of the capital markets, including of the IPFs, filled a serious gap; however, it did so in part by weakening corporate governance. Passage of an effective bankruptcy law would be an important complement to privatization. With regard to banking reform, the recent steps to strengthen the financial position of banks are welcome, and the authorities' approach of relying on provisioning for bank recapitalization appears workable in the Slovak circumstances. In recent years, the major banks (including those still under state control) have made commendable efforts to address their bad debt problems and have shown prudence in their lending decisions. However, good governance will be most effectively achieved through full privatization of the banks. Continuing strength in the external accounts should hasten the phasing out of the 10 percent import surcharge. The staff regrets the authorities decision to continue the import surcharge until mid-1996 and urges its early removal. Slovakia maintains a number of exchange restrictions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, as described in this report. In addition, the payments agreement with the Czech Republic gives rise to a multiple currency practice that is subject to approval under Article VIII. In view of the discriminatory nature of this practice, the staff does not recommend its approval. The staff welcomes the authorities' decision to raise the foreign exchange allowance for tourist travel abroad, and strongly supports their intention to liberalize the exchange system further with a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - view to achieving full current account uonvertibility and Article VIII status by January 1, 1996.

The currency of the Slovak Republic is the Slovak koruna, created on February 8, 1993 upon the dissolution of the currency union with the Czech Republic, which had used the Czechoslovak koruna as its currency. A single exchange rate applies to all transactions with the convertible currency area except the Czech Republic. The exchange rate is pegged to a basket of two currencies (the deutsche mark and the U.S. dollar). Following a 10 percent devaluation on July 9, 1993, the exchange rate stood at Sk 29.4 per U.S. dollar on June 30, 1995.

Slovak Rerdlic. RelatL (with The Slovak Republic became a member of the World Bank on January 1, 1993, by joint succession with the Czech Republic to the membership of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. A Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) (US$450 million), approved in June 1991 with Czechoslovakia.has been Eully disbursed. The Czech and Slovak Republics have assumed repayment obligations in the ratio of 2:l. The SAL was co-financed by the Japanese Export-Import Bank in the amount of US$200 million. A Country Economic Memorandum (CEK), which provides the basis for the Bank's future lending program, was circulated to the World Bank Executive Directors in July 1994. An Economic Recovery Loan (ERL) was approved in November 1993. The ERL supports Slovakia's ongoing transformation by financing many of the one-off costs associated with restructuring and the break up of the federation. The loan supports reforms in four areas.: (a) fiscal retrenchment; (b) strengthening and diversifying the financial sector; (c) continued privatization, private sector development and enterprise restructuring; and (d) a more efficient social safety net. As of January 1995, the loan has been fully disbursed. The Board approved the first telecommunications loan in May 1993 that will strengthen the international and domestic long-distance networks. The loan, with World Bank participation of US$55 million, was co-financed with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The International Finance Corporati.on (IFC) has held investment seminars for several enterprises and has, been in touch with large joint ventures and companies. The Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) has completed a diagnostic study of the foreign :investment climate in Slovakia and the report has been discussed with the authorities in December 1993. Although the Bank had 'been preparing several projects in the areas of enterprise and bank reform, energy, forestry, health finance and in the social sectors, the Government informed the Bank in April 1995 that further project preparation would have to be postponed until Slovakia has developed its medium-term strategy. In about six months, the Government would present its investment program to the international financing agencies, and the Bank and the Government would agree, jointly, on a program of cooperation.

Statistical problems seriously impeded economic analysis immediately after Slovakia's independence. Since then, the statistical base has improved considerably in conjunction with the technical assistance offered by the Fund (missions from RUl, FAD, MAR, STA, and the resident representative) and other agencies. From the point of view of macroeconomic analysis and policy making, the most important remaining problems involve the national accounts. Other outstanding issues include: the creation of consolidated accounts for the general governme.nt, the enhancement of capital account statistics', and the revision of the weights underlying the consumer price index. These areas have been.given special emphasis in the preparation of future technical assistance operations. With regard to macroeconomic statistics, the authorities have an open publication policy, which means that most relevant data are published with a lag of no more than six months. However, the staff has access to preliminary data with relatively short time lags--three weeks or less for budgetary data, ten days to a month for monetary data, a week or less for exchange rates and foreign reserve i.nformation, andas long as three months for other fiscal,.real sector, and balance of payments data. Real sector For the real sector, the timely-issuance of real sector data'(other than GDP data) has improved greatly. Serious difficulties still outstanding, however, arise from the limited coverage of national accounts data and the lags in their issuance. The national accounts are available from the expenditure side, but GDP is not broken down into sectoral components or income components in a manner which is consistent with the expenditure presentation. Inconsistencies also exist between industrial value added and production statistics as well as between industrial production and foreign trade data. Moreover, GDP data are subject to large revisions. With regard to prices, the current CPI index is based on weights reflecting the average 1989 expenditure pattern of households. These weights will be updated as of January 1, 1996. Fiscal sector Budgetary information has become much better during the past two years, even though coverage and classification of fiscal transactions have changed frequently--partly because of institutional changes within the government sector-- and double counting of certain extrabudgetary transactions has occurred with regularity. Data on government financing and debt service have improved in quality and timeliness. Local authorities' quarterly accounts are now received as a matter of course. Data on social security funds (established as independent extrabudgetary institutions in January 1994) have also improved, but are still somewhat irregular and of uneven quality. The authorities are planning to revise fiscal statistics in 1996 to comply with international statistical standards.
