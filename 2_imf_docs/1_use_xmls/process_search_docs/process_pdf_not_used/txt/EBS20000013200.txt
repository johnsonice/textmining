However, performance in 1999 was generally satisfactory in relation to the program targets. In particular, the fiscal deficit target for 1999 was achieved with a margin, and the CBJ’s net foreign asset position strengthened substantially as the balance of payments outcome was much more favorable than programmed. Significant progress has been achieved in structural reform, including fiscal monitoring and control, government debt management, trade liberalization, and privatization. Available indicators suggest that economic growth is recovering in 2000 in the context of continued low inflation, and fiscal policy is broadly on track. External sector developments appear to reflect an incipient recovery. Official international reserves have surpassed US$2.6 billion, equivalent to more than 8 months of imports or one-third of JD broad money. Macroeconomic policies--The 2000 program targets an increase in the real GDP growth rate to 3 percent, continued low inflation, and maintenance of the comfortable reserve position. The overall fiscal deficit before grants (including spending from privatization proceeds) is targeted at 7.5 percent of GDP in 2000, above the preliminary 1999 outturn. After grants, the overall fiscal deficit is programmed at 2.7 percent of GDP in 2oo0, below the preliminary 1999 outturn. The domestic cash needs of the government will be met through the auctioning of government securities. The deficit before grants is projected to be reduced by 1 percentage point of GDP each year in 2001-2002, primarily on the basis of the pIanned introduction of the VAT and continued restraint on current expenditure. The staff reiterated the view that an eventual move towards greater exchange rate flexibility would be desirable. However, the authorities felt that a change in the exchange rate regime would not be appropriate at this stage. Hence, monetary policy in 2000 will continue to be guided primarily by the objective of maintaining the stability of the Jordanian dinar. Structural policies-The reforms envisaged in the fiscal area would improve the tax and pension systems, and introduce flexibility to the domestic pricing of petroleum products. In the area of tax policy, the program calls for the conversion of the GST into a full-fledged VAT, and for a reform of the income tax. In the financial sector, the focus is on prudential regulation and supervision of the banking system, and further market development. As regards privatization, following the successful sale of JTC shares in early 2000, the main focus will be on privatizing the airline and power companies. Access and other issues-The purchases under the extended arrangement are being rephased, taking into account, inter alia, the larger than programmed improvement in the external position and the lack of reduction in the overall fiscal deficit in the current year. The availability and reliability of statisticsin Jordan now appears to be.more adequate for program monitoring purposes. The staff supports the authorities’ request for a waiver of nonobservance of a structural performance criterion for end-March 2000 relating to the submission of legislation converting the GST into a VAT; and completion of the second review.

Discussions for the 2000 Article IV consultation and second review under the extended arrangement were held in Amman during February 20-March 9, in Washington on the occasion of the IMFC spring meeting, and again in Amman during May 24-June 1. The Jordanian representatives included the Ministers of Finance, Planning, Industry and Trade, and Energy; the Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ); and representatives of the public enterprises, commercial banks, and the private sector.’ In their letter of request for completion of the review (Attachment I), the authorities are also requesting a waiver of the end-March 2000 structural performance criterion on submission to parliament of amendments to the GST law. 2. The extended arrangement was approved on April 15, 1999, on which occasion the Executive Board also concluded the last Article IV consultation. In concluding the first program review on October 5, 1999, directors noted that the authorities’ commitment to both macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms had contributed to the improvement in economic conditions and confidence. They stressed, however, that a sustained revival in economic growth would require continued fiscal restraint, the maintenance of monetary stability, and the vigorous pursuit of a range of structural reforms in such areas as the tax system and privatization. So far, Jordan has made purchases of SDR 2 1.32 million out of a total access under the EFF amounting to SDR 127.88 million (equivalent to 75 percent of quota). As of May 31,2000, Jordan’s outstanding Fund purchases amounted to SDR 355.70 million, equivalent to 208.6 percent of quota. Jordan has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4; in 1997, most remaining restrictions on capital account transactions were lifted.2 3. On the political front, King Abdullah is considered to have established his authority well since ascending the throne in February 1999, and he has often affirmed his intention to pursue modemization and economic reform. The government has recently been changed, but the direction of economic policy set by the King is expected to be maintained, and key members of the economic team have remained in office.3 ’ The mission teams consisted of Mr. Furtado (Head), Ms. Bhattacharya and Mr. Hardy (MED), Mr. Beaumont (PDR), Ms. Fouad (FAD); and Ms. Terrazas (Research Assistant, MED, February/March mission). Mr. Burton joined the mission team in Amman during the first round of discussions. 2 Jordan’s relations with the Fund are summarized in Appendix I. Relations with the World Bank group are summarized in Appendix II. 3 The new cabinet recently endorsed, without change, the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). Thus, the authorities’ letter requesting completion of the second review is dated July 4, 2000, even though the negotiation of the MEFP was completed on June 1.

Real GDP grew at only about 1 ‘/z percent annually, implying that income per head has been falling. With a rapidly growing labor force, the official unemployment rate remained at about 14 percent, but unofficial estimates put the rate at double this level. Much of the poor growth performance can be attributed to exogenous factors, such as weak demand in the region and impediments to trade with neighboring countries, in particular Iraq, but some inadequacy of domestic policies in creating an environment conducive to productive investment must share in the blame. 5. The budget deficit and the public debt remained high, with rigidities on the expenditure side and slow growth hampering fiscal adjustment. The overall fiscal deficit amounted to about 7% percent of GDP before grants during the second half of the 199Os, except for 1998, when some policy slippages, the clearance of domestic arrears, and the widening of the coverage of government expenditures in the fiscal statistics inflated the deficit by 3 percentage points of GDP (Box 1 discusses a wider concept of the public sector deficit). The fiscal deficit after grants-which is the concept relevant to debt dynamics-was in the range of only 2% to 3’/2 percent of GDP (again with the exception of 1998, when it was higher). Fiscal adjustment has been made difficult by slow growth and rigidities on the expenditure side. Wages, pensions, and interest outlays constitute more than half of current spending, while military expenditure accounts for another third. As a result, current spending has been maintained at around 30 percent of GDP, while adjustment has been achieved through cuts in capital spending. The deficit of the consolidated public sector (defined to include the general budgetary government, autonomous agencies with their own budgets, the CBJ, and the Social Security Corporation) has been smaller than that of the general budgetary government (Box 1). The slow growth in GDP has left the ratio of total public sector debt to GDP close to 130 percent during the second half of the decade. 6. Yet during this period inflation was consistently low, monetary stability was reinforced, and the external position strengthened substantially. The CBJ actively managed interest rates, and in particular the rate on its certificates of deposit (CDs), to support the exchange rate peg and maintain demand for the Jordanian dinar (JD) when faced with shocks to confidence, but also to lower the cost of borrowing for investment when circumstances permitted. In this regard, it is significant that most of the increase in broad money in the second half of the 1990s can be accounted for by the increase in the net foreign assets of the banking system. Developments in Jordan’s balance of payments tended to be positive; in particular, there was a narrowing in the external trade and current accounts, and exports of manufactured goods rose by 9 percent annually over 1997-99. Official international reserves mounted quickly beginning in 1996, and reached US$1.7 billion by end-1997. Renewed tensions in the region in early 1998, and then the final illness of King Hussein, put pressure on the reserve position, but the authorities successfully defended the peg. 4 For greater details, please refer to the report on Recent Economic Developments.

The Jordanian Public Sector The public sector in Jordan consists of the central government, whose operations are governed by the general budget, a number of autonomous public agencies and public financial institutions, nonfinancial public enterprises (NFPEs), and local governments, which have limited financial autonomy. The group of autonomous agencies comprises 26 institutions with their own budgets approved by the Cabinet. Included in this group are institutions such as extrabudgetary funds (e.g., the National Aid Fund) and more or less commercially-oriented public enterprises (e.g., the Ports Authority). The Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) is the largest autonomous agency in terms of revenue, investment, and government support. The consolidated deficit of the autonomous agencies has typically been about 1 percent of GDP. Among public financial institutions, the most important are the CBJ and the Social Security Corporation (SSC). The CBJ has been making small losses since 1996, associated with the issuing CDs, but is expected to break even in 2000 due to lower domestic interest rates and the reduction in the stock of unremunerated advances to government. The SSC is largely autonomous and operates the nongovernment pension system. On a cash basis, it typically records a surplus equivalent to 2-3 percent of GDP each year, though in actuarial terms its pension liabilities are only about 70 percent funded. The evolution of the consolidated after-grants balance of the budgetary general government, the autonomous agencies, the CBJ and the SSC is shown below.

Important NFPEs include the phosphate and potash mining companies; the Jordan Telecommunications Company (JTC); the Royal Jordanian airline (RJ); and the power companies NEPCO, CEGCO, and EDCO. JTC, which has now been partially privatized, has generally been highly profitable, with revenues amounting to almost 4 percent of GDP per year, current expenditure of about 1.5 percent of GDP, and investment of about 1 percent of GDP. In recent years, RJ has rationalized its fleet and its route structure, and paid off much domestic debt, which has enabled it to make a small profit in 1999 despite lower revenues. The power sector, with revenues about equal to those of JTC, has normally achieved a small surplus on its current account, but has had to invest heavily to keep up with rising demand.

The inception of the extended arrangement coincided with a delicate political transition, which translated into financial vulnerability.’ In addition, regional conditions and domestic economic trends made a rapid recovery in growth seem unlikely. Accordingly, the growth and reserve objectives of the 1999 program were relatively modest, while the target for the fiscal deficit (before grants) implied an adjustment effort sufficient to bring it back to about its pre- 1998 level. The demand for the dinar was expected to improve gradually as the program took root and the political transition was consolidated. Given the economic and political uncertainties, the downside risks to the program were deemed substantial. 8. Economic performance in 1999 was generally satisfactory in relation to the program targets. Real GDP is estimated to have grown at 1.6 percent over the year, compared with the target of 1.2 percent (Table 1). Growth of nonagricultural output, particularly in the electricity/water and transport/communication sectors, more than offset a 20 percent decline in agriculture due to drought. The increase in the average consumer price index was only 0.6 percent, despite an increase in the General Sales Tax (GST) rate and in administered gasoline prices at mid-year. Low inflation is attributable to slack domestic demand, the effect on the price of tradable goods of the dollar appreciation, and lower customs tariffs. 9. The fiscal deficit target for 1999 was achieved with a margin. The overall fiscal deficit6 amounted to 7.3 percent of GDP (before grants), compared with the program target of 7.9 percent of GDP (and a deficit of 10.4 percent of GDP in 1998). However, the composition of the fiscal accounts was different from that envisaged under the program: the balances in nontreasury accounts were built up rather than being depleted as projected, which more than offset an overrun in the budget deficit. The overall deficit after grants in 1999 was equivalent to 3.6 percent of GDP, 0.6 percent of GDP below the program projection (Table 2). Following good performance through September, both tax and nontax revenue fell short of their programmed levels in the last quarter as transfers from JTC were cut in the run- up to its privatization and excise taxes on cars were reduced. These developments were partially offset by expenditure and net loans to public enterprises also being below programmed levels. Financing was roughly evenly split between domestic and foreign sources. The adjusted 1999 performance criteria on net bank credit to government were met, but the December indicative targets on the budget deficit and domestic budgetary revenues were missed (Table 3). 5 The negotiations took place in February 1999, coinciding with King Hussein’s death and the ascension of King Abullah. 6 The overall fiscal deficit is defined as the sum of the budget deficit and the net change in the balances in nontreasury accounts.

Broad money expanded much more rapidly than envisaged in the program. Much of the excess (6 percentage points above the program projection) came in the form of increased holdings of dinar deposits after the uncertainties of late 1998 and early 1999 (Table 4). The net domestic assets of the banking system grew only marginally due to the budgetary developments described above and relatively slow growth in credit to the private sector.’ Correspondingly, JD reserve money grew by 13 percent, rather than the 7 percent programmed (Table 5). The CBJ’s net foreign asset position strengthened substantially, while its net domestic assets contracted, reflecting the mopping up of liquidity by the CBJ and the low government borrowing needs. All monetary performance criteria were met with wide margins. 11. The CBJ lowered its interest rates substantially during 1999. With the return of confidence and the strengthening of the external position, the CBJ was able to reduce the benchmark 3-month CD rate to about 6 percent by the end of the year, more than 400 basis points below the level prevailing at the start of the extended arrangement (Chart 1). From mid-year, the CBJ felt confident enough that it could leave considerable excess reserves with the commercial banks and eventually reduce the interest rate on its overnight deposit facility to near zero, in an effort to induce more lending to the private sector. The effect was limited, however, because commercial banks were concerned about the profitability of investment projects, and about maintaining lending rates at a level sufficient to cover the cost of deposits, which came down only slowly.* 7 The economic slowdown has led to some deterioration in the quality of banks’ loan portfolios: more than 11 percent of banks’ loans were classified as impaired in June 1999 (the most recent date for which data are available), 4.5 percent higher than in 1996, and the proportion would be higher still if the classification were based on the standard criterion of 90 days past due, rather the 180 days past due criterion in force in Jordan. However, according to available reports, the banking system as a whole was profitable in 1999, all banks met the 12 percent capital adequacy requirement, and the average risk-weighted capital ratio was above 20 percent. a The average interest rate on time deposits fell from 8.3 percent at end-1998 to 7.9 percent at end- 1999, while the average rate on bank loans fell from 12.9 percent to 12.7 percent over the same period. Deposit and loan rates fell to 7.2 and 12.0 percent, respectively, by end-April 2000. Econometric studies suggest that a 100 basis points change in the 3-month CD rate will lead after about 9 months to a 20-40 basis points change in average term deposit and overdraft lending rates, However, marginal rates appear to move more quickly; reportedly large customers negotiate deposit or lending rates with their banks based on current market conditions.

The external current account registered a surplus of 5.2 percent of GDP, including grants of 5.2 percent of GDP, and UN compensation transfers of 3.3 percent of GDP (Table 6).9 The trade deficit was narrower than projected, as lower growth of exports of phosphates, fertilizer, and agricultural products was more than offset by lower imports, especially in the first quarter. The current account outturn also reflected a higher than anticipated level of foreign grants and UN compensation transfers. Strong private capital inflows started in the second quarter of the year as confidence returned, contributing to a substantial capital account surplus. Official foreign exchange reserves reached an unprecedented US$2 billion (almost 7 months of imports) by the end of 1999, compared with the program target of US$l.2 billion. The real effective exchange rate index (1990=100) rose in the course of the year from about 114 in the first quarter to 117 in the fourth due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies, but on average was at about the same level as that prevailing since late-1997 (Chart 2; Box 2 contains a further discussion of Jordan’s external competitiveness). 13. Significant progress was achieved during 1999 in several areas of structural reform. Steps were taken to improve fiscal monitoring and control, for example, through the establishment of a fiscal monitoring unit, and the prohibition of new spending commitments at the end of the year, which had the effect of reducing the year-end ‘float’. In the area of government debt management, regular auctions of government securities were introduced as the main form of domestic borrowing for the budget, the proceeds from which have allowed the stock of noninterest bearing credit from the CBJ to government to be reduced substantially.” In the trade area, the maximum import tariff rate was reduced to 35 percent (from 40 percent), rates on imported inputs were lowered, excise taxes on cars were cut by almost half, and a further reduction of the maximum tariff rate (to 30 percent) was announced with the 2000 budget. Moreover, many of the enabling legislative steps were taken for Jordan’s membership in the WTO. In October, the CBJ reintroduced a spread of 0.3 percent between its buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar (it had bought and sold dollars at its official selling rate since 1996); since then, the interbank foreign exchange market has become more active. 9 In recent years Jordanians have been receiving funds from the U.N. Compensation Commission, established under Security Council Resolution 687 (1991). These inflows rose from US$65 million in 1998 to US$248 million in 1999, and are expected to reach some US$O.5 billion in 2000. Earlier payments were compensation for those who had to depart Kuwait or Iraq due to the Gulf crisis, or for those who suffered personal injuries. More recent compensation covered losses of personal property, income, financial assets, and real estate. These funds are processed by the Ministry of Labor in Jordan, so-they lower net credit to the general government until they are disbursed to the individual claiming the compensation. lo The securities auctions have functioned well: all important banks participate, and the interest rate on treasury bills is comparable to that on central bank CDs.

Measures of Jordan’s International Competitiveness The maintenance of the competitiveness-of Jordan’s tradable goods sector is essential for the revival of growth, especially given the openness of the economy. Indicators of competitiveness include measures of the real effective exchange rate and of trade performance. Real effective exchange rate (REER)-The Jordanian dinar has appreciated moderately in recent years. Following a large depreciation in 1988-89, the REER of the JD remained roughly constant over 1990-96. However, the REER appreciated by 15 percent during 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. Since then, it has fluctuated in a contained range, reflecting movements in the U.S. dollar against other major currencies. A number of identifiable factors may affect the “equilibrium” REER. On the one hand, Jordan has undertaken extensive trade reform in recent years-tariffs have been reduced significantly, as have nontariff barriers such as import monopolies. While these reforms improve efficiency by correcting relative prices, they also have an effect similar to that of an appreciation of the real exchange rate relative to its equilibrium level. On the other hand, the recent rise in the world oil price would tend to raise Jordan’s equilibrium real exchange rate because the negative balance-of-payments impact of higher oil import prices should be offset over the medium term by the positive impact of stronger regional demand for Jordanian exports of goods and labor services. Trade performance-Jordan’s recent trade performance has been mixed. Overall exports have been flat, but exports of manufactured goods grew at a healthy pace in 1998-99. Jordan’s share in EU imports has fallen from its peak, but is still higher than in 1992-93 (Chart). Jordan’s share in the imports of Middle Eastern countries was lower in 1998-99 than earlier in the decade, but a large part of the fall is attributable to the decline in exports to Iraq; Jordan’s share in the imports of important economies in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has tended to increase. In recent years, the market shares in the Middle East and the EU of Jordan’s regional competitors such as Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria have generally fallen, but Turkey’s export performance has been better.

A private management contract was awarded to a French concern to run the operations of the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) in the Amman area. The contract includes clauses providing incentives to reduce wastage and system losses. An agreement was concluded with a foreign-led consortium to operate, upgrade, and extend the Aqaba railway. This deal should not only lead to about US$lOO million investment in the railway, but also facilitate investments in the mining and fertilizer sectors. The government-owned Jordan Investment Company sold its minority shareholdings in ten companies, including its remaining shares in the Housing Bank. Meanwhile, as a prelude to privatization, the Royal Jordanian airline (RJ) and the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) started undergoing major restructuring. RJ’s noncore businesses, such as duty-free shops and engine maintenance facilities, were separated from its flight operations, with a view to privatizing the former in the course of 2000. The proceeds from the sale of noncore businesses will be used to pay off RJ’s domestic bank debt, and the government assumed RJ’s debt to the petroleum refinery, so the only significant liabilities that will be left with RJ flight operations will be aircraft leases. In the power sector, the NEPCO was split into a generating company (CEGCO), a distribution company (EDCO), both of which are to be privatized, and a transmission company (the scaled-down NEPCO). An independent regulatory body for the power sector was established, and negotiations began with candidates for the independent power producer (IPP) project. B. Developments to Date in 2000 15. Available indicators suggest that economic growth is recovering. In particular, nonagricultural output expanded by around 3 percent in the first quarter, with strong growth in nontraditional exports, non-oil imports (which comprise in large part inputs and investment goods), and tourism. Adequate winter rains should allow agriculture to recover substantially from last year’s drought. Hence, real growth of GDP could reach 3 percent this year, although there is downside risk, due, for instance, to the possibility of delays in the start of some large investment projects. Inflation continues to be low. 16. Fiscal policy is broadly on track. The overall fiscal deficit before grants amounted _ to 1.3 percent of GDP in the first quarter (compared to 1 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 1999), and the deficit after grants was just 0.4 percent of GDP. During the first quarter the government issued JD 60 million net in bills and bonds, in line with the program objectives of developing the market for government securities and retiring interest-free advances from the CBJ-the outstanding stock declined by JD 40 million. In March the government formally assumed JD 158 million in domestic WAJ debt that it had previously been servicing.” Of this total, most of the commercial bank loans of JD 32 million and loans from the Social Security Corporation (SSC) amounting to JD 71 million were restructured, resulting in lower amortization payments in 2000. -- ‘I Due to WAYS financial difficulties, the guarantees on this domestic debt have been called over the last few years. The government’s decision to assume the debt was determined primarily by the objective of restructuring it in more favorable terms.

The net foreign assets of the banking system were bolstered by the receipt of privatization proceeds from abroad (see below) and UN compensation funds. Growth in credit to the private sector remained moderate, though lending rates have continued to fall slowly. The share of deposits in foreign currency rose slightly, perhaps due to the disbursement of UN compensation funds, which are thought to be largely saved in dollar- denominated accounts. In February, the CBJ restored the interest rate on its overnight facility to a level just below that on its CDs, and, in response to rising U.S. interest rates, from May onwards it allowed the CD rate to rise about 50 basis points. 18. External sector developments appeared to reflect an incipient recovery. In the first quarter of 2000, the external current account showed a small deficit excluding grants and receipts of UN compensation; including grants and UN compensation, a surplus equivalent to 3.2 percent of GDP was recorded. The.value of imports recovered from the very depressed level of the previous year, in part due to higher oil prices. The surplus on the services account also improved. The capital account was dominated by the inflow of privatization receipts, with the overall balance of payments showing a surplus of more than US$700 million, or about 10 percent of GDP. Official international reserves have surpassed US$2.6 billion, equivalent to more than 8 months of imports or one-third of JD broad money. The real effective exchange rate reflected the rise of the U.S. dollar against other major currencietihe index reached 119.5 in March (1990=100). 19. Further progress has been made in the area of structural reforms. The maximum import tariff rate was reduced to 30 percent in April, followed by the elimination of tariffs on numerous industrial inputs.12 Jordan became a member of the WTO in April, which required the amendment of several laws, including the GST law, which parliament considered during its regular session early in the year. Rules of parliamentary procedure prevented the authorities from submitting to parliament at that time the additional set of amendments to the GST law needed to convert the GST into a value-added tax. Therefore, the structural performance criterion on submission of these amendments was not observed. However, the VAT amendments were introduced at a special session of parliament that opened in May and are presently being debated. In the financial area, to promote competition between banks and reduce lending rates, the CBJ required banks to publish their prime lending rates, deregulated their commissions, and reduced reserve requirements (from 14 percent to 12 percent). The current special session of parliament is expected to pass the new Banking, Deposits Insurance, and Insurance Companies Laws.13 I2 Jordan’s tariff regime now has five bands (0,5, 10,20, and 30 percent), and the Customs Department of the Ministry of Finance calculates the weighted average tariff rate at 13.5 percent in mid-2000, down from 16.6 percent at end-l 998. I3 The main features of the Banking Law are described in EBS/S l/99. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - 20. The telecom privatization represented a major step forward in the privatization area. In January, a share of 40 percent of JTC was sold to a foreign-led consortium, and of 8 percent to the SSC.14 Total receipts after costs were JD 410 million (equivalent to 7.4 percent of GDP), of which JD 358 million was from abroad. The funds received were placed in special accounts at the central bank, where they earn interest at market rates. In order to regulate the use of privatization proceeds, the government submitted to parliament a new Privatization Law, which has been approved by session. The law establishes a Privatization Council’ P arliament during the current special to oversee the privatization strategy. and to decide on the use of privatization proceeds, an Executive Privatization Commission 16 to manage the preparation and implementation of privatizations, and a Privatization Proceeds Fund. It also specifies that privatization proceeds can be used for investment in financial assets; the retirement of government debt; meeting the direct costs of privatization; support to workers affected by the privatization process; and infrastructure projects and social programs. The operational details have yet to be established by the Privatization Council. 21. Progress is being made with other elements of the privatization program. Bids have been received for RJ’s duty-free shops and flight training subsidiary, and discussions are underway with two potential strategic partners for the airline operations. The government has retained a consultant to review the separation effected last year of the assets of NEPCO, CEGCO, and EDCO, and to help design a definitive power purchasing agreement between CEGCO and NEPCO. Meanwhile, the government is in the process of retaining an advisor to help in specifying, by the end of the year, the steps that will be needed to make the regulatory commission fully operational, and the modalities for privatization of CEGCO and EDCO. IV. THEPROPOSEDPROGRAMFOR 2000 22. The discussions on the program for 2000 were protracted, resulting in a substantial revision in the schedule for the current review. This was principally because the budgetary outlook has been adversely affected by several factors, and extensive negotiations were required to agree on the budget deficit target. Involved discussions were needed also to reach understandings on the use of privatization proceeds following the large sale of JTC shares. The program targets maintenance of the overall fiscal deficit before grants (including spending from privatization proceeds) at about the same level in relation to GDP as in 1999; the deficit after grants is expected to decline below its 1999 level. The I4 An additional 1 percent is to be sold to employees. l5 The Privatization Council is to be chaired by the Prime Minister and comprises the Minister of Finance, and several other ministers, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Director of the Privatization Commission, and three experts appointed by Cabinet. I6 The Privatization Commission is charged with the implementation of the privatization program and its director is attached to the Prime Minister’s office and appointed by Cabinet for a period of two years.

A. Macroeconomic Framework” 23. The program targets an increase in the real GDP growth rate, continued low inflation, and maintenance of the comfortable reserve position. Real GDP growth is targeted at 3 percent in 2000, predicated on a rebound in agricultural production following the severe drought of 1999, and the ongoing pace of activity in the rest of the economy. The authorities envisage that the growth rate would accelerate to 4 percent or more by 2002, based on the strength of large mining projects, development of the tourism sector, and investment stimulated by the structural reforms. CPI inflation is targeted at 2% percent, with the GDP deflator lagging somewhat, on account of a projected decline in the terms of trade. Inflation is projected to remain low during the remaining period of the extended arrangement. Following the large increases during 1999 and early 2000, end-year official foreign exchange reserves are targeted at US$2.5 billion (or 30 percent of broad money). The implied increase over the end-l 999 level (about US$SOO million) is commensurate with the receipts from abroad related to the JTC privatization. Thereafter, foreign exchange reserves are projected to remain approximately constant at that level. B. Fiscal Policy’* 24. The program targets an overall deficit before grants (including spending from privatization proceeds) of 7.5 percent of GDP in 2000. Reclassification of amortization payments (on WAJ domestic debt assumed by the government early this year) from net lending (deficit expanding) to financing (deficit neutral) will reduce the measured deficit target by 0.5 percent of GDP in 2000 compared with the practice in 1999.19 The 2000 deficit before reclassification would be 8.0 percent of GDP compared with the preliminary 1999 outturn of 7.3 percent of GDP (see text table). The budget deficit (which excludes spending from privatization proceeds) is targeted at 7 percent of GDP in 2000. In addition, the government has decided to spend a limited portion of the proceeds from the sale of JTC __ I7 The macroeconomic framework is discussed in paragraphs 9-l 1 of the MEFP (Attachment I). I8 Fiscal policy and the structural reforms in the fiscal area discussed in paragraphs 12-13 and 17-20 of the MEFP (see Attachment I). l9 Amortization on this debt in 2000 was originally projected at ID 37 million (0.7 percent of GDP), but is now projected at JD 3 1 million (0.5 percent of GDP, about the same level as in 1999) as the result of rescheduling following the assumption by government. Interest due in 2000 amounts to ID 17 million (0.3 percent of GDP).

The target for the overall fiscal deficit before grants falls short of that . envisaged at the time of the first review primarily because the “oil surplus” is now projected to be about 2 percentage points of GDP lower than projected earlier.20 However, the amount of measures, 2% percentage points of GDP (discussed below), remains comparable to that ” The lower oil surplus is due to the increase in the price at which Jordan imports oil from Iraq, from an average of US$l2.5 per barrel in 1999 to an estimated US$l9 in 2000, and constant domestic prices. The authorities felt unable to increase domestic petroleum prices this year, as suggested by the mission, after the 9 percent hike in gasoline prices in mid- 1999 (regular gasoline in Jordan now costs JD 0.24 per litre, or about US$l.20 per U.S. gallon, compared to an ex-refinery price of about US$O.72 per gallon at end-1999). Higher oil prices will increase the value of the oil grant from Iraq by about 1.2 percent of GDP.

After grants, the overall fiscal deficit is programmed at 2.7 percent of GDP in 2000 (compared with 2.1 percent of GDP projected at the time of the first review). 25. The program seeks to limit the trend deterioration in the fiscal position. In the absence of measures, revenue in 2000 would have declined by 2.7 percentage points of GDP, reflecting a reduction in the “oil surplus”, lower revenue from JTC following its privatization tariff, and the import tariff reductions implemented in mid-1999 and March of 2000. On the’ expenditure side, there are pressures amounting to 0.6 percent of GDP arising from the wage increases granted in mid-1999 and higher external interest payments. These effects would have been only partly offset by the full-year impact (1 percent of GDP) of the increase in the GST rate (from 10 percent to 13 percent) in mid-1999. Thus, the increase in the fiscal deficit before grants in the absence of measures would have amounted to 2.3 percent of GDP, which would have been compounded by an increase in capital expenditure (including spending from privatization proceeds) by 0.7 percent of GDP. The program incorporates measures amounting to 2.2 percent of GDP, comprising: (i) increases in a number of fees, a tax on airline tickets, and increased jet fuel prices (0.5 percent of GDP); (ii) land sales by the Jordan Valley Authority (0.5 percent of GDP); and (iii) reductions in current expenditure, including containment in military outlays and elimination of the remaining food subsidy (1.2 percent of GDP). In addition, as noted above, amortization of WAJ domestic debt has been reclassified from net lending to financing following its assumption by the government, with a corresponding downward impact on the measured fiscal deficit. During the discussions, the staff expressed concern that revenue might fall short of projections, but the authorities were confident that the revenue targets would be achieved, and stressed that they were fully committed to the deficit target and would take measures as necessary in the event of revenue shortfalls. 26. The bulk of the privatization proceeds will be invested in financial assets or used for debt reduction operations. As noted, the just approved Privatization Law permits privatization proceeds to be spent on infrastructure projects, social programs, and support to workers affected by the privatization process. However, consistent with its strategy to avoid unsustainable increases in public expenditure as a result of privatization, the government plans to limit spending on infrastructure projects and social programs to 15 percent of the proceeds. Thus, a total of JD 62 million could be spent out of the net proceeds from the recent sale of shares in JTC (which amounted to JD 410 million); for 2000, it is agreed that only a portion of this total-JD 27 million, equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP-would be spent under the 2000 program. Spending from the Privatization Proceeds Fund will be specified in the budget law, subject to the normal budgetary audit procedures, and reported to parliament. 27. The domestic cash needs of the government will be met through the auctioning of government securities. The overall fiscal financing need in 2000 is projected at JD 148 million (2.7 percent of GDP). After a small net repayment of external debt, the government’s residual financing need amounts to JD 161 million. This is far less than the net proceeds from the JTC privatization, which, however, are effectively frozen in special privatization accounts (except for the amount of JD 27 million noted above). Hence, the government will need to mobilize domestic cash resources of about JD 130 million to finance Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - its operations. This will be done primarily through auctions of treasury bills and bonds (the outstanding stocks of these securities is projected to increase, respectively, by JD 90 million and JD 40 million by the end of the year). In the event the auction proceeds were to exceed- the government’s cash needs, the excess would be allocated to the retirement of interest free advances obtained in the past from the CBJ.*’ 28. The discussions addressed the challenge of strengthening the fiscal position over the medium term. The authorities recognize the vital importance of reducing the stock of government debt outstanding and Jordan’s dependence on foreign grants for budget financing. To this end they envisage decreasing the budget deficit before grants by 1 percentage point of GDP each year in 2001-2002, primarily on the basis of the planned introduction of the VAT and continued restraint on current expenditure. Spending from privatization proceeds during that period will be the subject of the next program review in light of the amount spent in 2000, and possible additional privatization receipts. At this stage, it is projected that the overall fiscal deficit would not exceed 6.3 percent of GDP in 2001 and 5.3 percent of GDP in 2002; the deficit after grants is projected to remain stable at around 2% percent of GDP since grants may decline from the high level projected for 2000. On this basis, the ratio of total public and publicly guaranteed debt to GDP should fall substantially over 2000-2002 (Box 3). Given the already relatively high tax burden, these objectives will require continued fiscal consolidation and structural reforms designed to rationalize government expenditure over the medium term. 29. The structural reforms envisaged in the fiscal area would improve the tax and pension systems, and introduce flexibility to the domestic pricing of petroleum products. In the area of tax policy, the program calls for the conversion of the GST into a full-fledged VAT, and for a reform of the income tax. The related amendments to the GST law, which are being considered by parliament, aim at extending the tax to the wholesale and retail stage with a full refunding mechanism, broadening the base for taxed services, reducing exemptions, and replacing some exemptions by zero rates. Adoption of a budget for 2001 incorporating the implementation of the VAT constitutes a structural performance criterion. The amendments to the income tax law, which have been subject of technical assistance from the Fund, are still being discussed within the government but are expected to be submitted to parliament at the start of the next ordinary session in November (a structural performance criterion), so that the reform is implemented in the course of 2001. They are aimed at, inter alia, unifying the corporate income tax rates, simplifying and rationalizing the personal . . *I The issue of government securities and redempti& of debt at the central bank also absorbs liquidity, thus allowing the central bank to issue fewer CDs, which reduces its interest expenses. Hence, for the government sector as a whole, the issue of government securities is cost neutral for any given monetary policy stance.

Government and Government-Guaranteed Debt Jordan continues to be burdened with a heavy stock of public debt, with an overall debt to GDP ratio of almost 130.percent. Even though the government deficit after grants was below 4 percent of GDP in most of the second half of the 199Os, the slow growth in nominal GDP has kept the debt ratio broadly unchanged. Currently, about 80 percent of Jordan’s government and government-guaranteed debt is external, and most of the rest is owed to the domestic banking system. Much of the external debt consists of bilateral official claims, of which claims of Paris Club creditors form the largest share. There is very little short-term nongovemment external debt. Domestic debt consists primarily of the CBJ’s claims on government, which are mostly not remunerated; marketable government securities held by the commercial banks; and bank loans to nonfinancial public enterprises.’ The revision to the classification of public sector institutions from 1999 (see EBS/99/180, Appendix IV) had the effect of increasing measured net domestic public debt by 1.5 percent of GDP. The overall debt ratio is declining sharply in 2000 as privatization-related deposits have reduced the banking system’s net claims on government and the ratio of external debt to GDP is also expected to fall. Further significant declines in the debt ratio are projected over the remainder of the program period as growth accelerates and the government exercises consistent fiscal restraint. Meanwhile, net domestic commercial bank credit to government is projected to rise further due to the increased issuance of government securities; correspondingly, the government has already begun paying off advances from the CBJ, and no longer resorts to significant nonbank financing. The program envisages that investment by NFPEs will require some revival in their need for bank credit.

With regard to import taxation, the staff welcomed the recent reductions in tariff rates but was concerned that further exemptions for industrial inputs would erode the revenue base and increase effective protection. 30. The authorities are committed to designing the new petroleum pricing mechanism and the reform of the civil service pension system. The inclusion of these elements constitutes an important addition to the menu of structural policies supported through the extended arrangement. The authorities acknowledged the importance of these issues, as evidenced by the loss of “oil surplus” in the current fiscal year and the prospect of rising pension payments by the budget over the medium term. Addressing them, and in particular pension reform, will be essential if fiscal consolidation is to be sustained. However, the development of appropriate systems is technically challenging, and external technical assistance is viewed as critical. The government is committed to adopt, before the end of 2000, an oil pricing strategy based on which the domestic prices of petroleum products will be adjusted in line with import price developments starting in 2001. A draft strategy to reform the civil service pension system will be presented to the cabinet by the Ministry of Finance.** 31. The next stage of fiscal reform will be a rationalization of other government expenditure over the medium term. To this end, as noted in the MEFP, the government is at the early stages of designing, with technical assistance from the World Bank, public sector reforms whose primary objective would be a more efficient delivery public services, in particular in the areas of health and education. C. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies23 32. The discussions addressed the relationship between monetary and exchange rate policy, and the exchange rate regime. The staff reiterated the view that moving towards greater exchange rate flexibility would be desirable. This would allow the real effective exchange rate to adjust to external and other shocks affecting Jordan, rather than being dominated by movements of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies, as at present. It would also decouple interest rates in Jordan from those in the United States. In these circumstances, the staff noted that further tightening of monetary conditions in the United States would imply a similar trend in Jordan, with an adverse impact on the incipient recovery. The staff also expressed concern that the appreciation of the U.S. dollar (and, ** The Fund provided technical assistance earlier this year and recommended the following options, which vary in terms of their ambitiousness and speed of implementation: (i) reforming the existing public pension system to bring it more in line with the private pension scheme operated by the SSC; (ii) consolidating the public pension system with the SSC; and (iii) conducting a comprehensive systemic reform, including the civil service pay and allowance scales. 23 The macroeconomic policies and structural reforms covered in this section are discussed in paragraphs 14 and 21-22 of the MEFP (see Attachment I). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - consequently, of the JD), particularly in relation to the Euro, would be detrimental to Jordan’s tradable goods sector. 33. The authorities were of the view that a change in the exchange rate regime would not be appropriate at this stage. They are aware that benefits could be derived from a more flexible exchange rate regime, but were above all concerned that a change would be interpreted by the markets as prelude to a depreciation. This posed the risk that a move to greater flexibility might render it very costly to maintain the stability of the currency by initially requiring steep increases in interest rates, especially because the demand for the dinar as a conduit for savings in Jordan and neighboring territories was intrinsically linked to its stability. Regarding the competitiveness issue, the authorities did not dispute that the recent appreciation was potentially detrimental to exports, but pointed out that the benefits of a depreciation would tend to be dissipated by inflation given the openness of the economy. Moreover, they were encouraged by the export performance in the first quarter of 2000, particularly the 9 percent growth in nontraditional exports-and in any event expected that movements of major currencies were likely to be reversed. 34. Monetary policy in 2000 will thus continue to be guided primarily by the objective of maintaining the stability of the Jordanian dinar. After the recent rise in official interest rates in reaction to the rise in U.S. interest rates, and given the comfortable reserve position and the concern over the still fragile real economy, the CBJ will seek to minimize further increases in rates, subject to maintenance of reserves at a safe level. The CBJ is projecting that its net international reserves will increase by about JD 360 million over the year, largely reflecting receipts from abroad related to the JTC privatization. However, the program floor in this area incorporates a margin for nonsterilized intervention, which widens in steps to JD 100 million (about US$140 million) by end-December 2000. Based on developments in the first four months of 2000, broad money growth is expected to decelerate this year to about 8% percent, which would still allow for ample credit to the private sector to finance the prospective pick-up in investment and business activity. With the decline in money market interest rates over the past year, the authorities expect that commercial bank lending rates will come down further during the next few months, a trend that should encourage economic expansion. 35. The structural reforms envisaged for the financial sector focus on prudential regulation and supervision of the banking system, and further market development. In the prudential area, the CBJ will introduce a new regulation defining commercial banks’ maximum foreign currency exposure relative to their capital, in accordance with international best practice. The CBJ is aware of the strain on the quality of commercial banks’ loan portfolios imposed by slow economic growth, and of the importance of maintaining bank soundness. Therefore, the CBJ is prepared to tighten provisioning requirements even as commercial banks’ profitability has come under pressure. In particular, it is phasing in over three years a requirement for banks to classify as impaired, and make provisions against, all loans more than 90 days past due, as against 180 days previously; already in 2000 they have reduced the criterion to 150 days past due. As regards development of the money and capital markets, the main vehicle under the program is securitization of government debt. However, the impact of the ongoing auctions is modest due to the excessively strict limits on the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - issuance of government securities stipulated in the Public Debt Law. To address this issue, the government intends to submit to parliament, at the start of the next ordinary session in November, a revised public debt law that will rationalize the rules for issuing public debt and the tax treatment of different instruments for government borrowing. To promote development of the interbank foreign exchange market, the CBJ will make merely indicative rather than mandatory the CBJ’s announced exchange rates of the Jordanian dinar against currencies other than the U.S. dollar; and increase the minimum size of foreign exchange transactions between the CBJ and commercial banks. D. Public Enterprise Reform and Privatization24 36. Following the successful sale of JTC shares in early 2000, the main focus of the privatization program will be on the airline and power companies. Concerning RJ, the duty-free subsidiary is expected to be sold by end-July, and the flight training subsidiary by end-September. The other subsidiaries (catering, engine overhaul, and aircraft maintenance) are expected to be privatized by the end of the year. Proceeds from these sales will go to retire F2J’s domestic debt. The government is seeking a strategic partner for the airline, whose operations were profitable in 1999 and are expected to improve further in 2000. Concerning the power sector, the next steps in the privatization process are selecting the IPP, completing the process of separating the three power companies, and putting in place the regulatory commission. The IPP will be chosen by end-July, which will allow groundbreaking for the new power plant in early 2001. The government has retained a consultant to review the separation effected last year of the assets of NEPCO, CEGCO, and EDCO, and to help design a definitive power purchasing agreement between CEGCO and NEPCO that will be in effect in early 2001. The World Bank is assisting the government in the process of specifying the steps that will be needed to make the regulatory commission fully operational and the modalities for privatization of CEGCO and EDCO. 37. The privatization program is being extended to other sectors. The government is in the process of corporatizing the operations of its storage facilities such as silos and cold storage units with a view to their privatization. The JIC expects to sell its shares in an additional eight companies during 2000. WAJ is preparing to offer a private management contract for its operations in the Wadi Mussa region, and a build-operate-transfer arrangement for the development of a waste-water treatment facility in the Amman region; WAJ management is also studying the scope for the introduction of private management and capital into other projects, such as a desalination plant. Before year-end, the government will conduct a preparatory study for the awarding of a private management contract for operation of the postal service. 24 Public enterprise reform and privatization are discussed in paragraphs 23-26 of the MEFP (see Attachment I).

The modified schedule (Appendix III) takes into account, inter alia, the larger than programmed improvement in the external position and the lack of reduction in the overall fiscal deficit in the current year. Quantitative performance criteria have been set for end-September and end- December 2000. They cover the same variables as under the 1999 program, with the addition of quarterly ceilings on spending out of privatization proceeds. The MEFP also specifies structural performance criteria and benchmarks for the remainder of 2000. Progress in implementing the domestic oil pricing strategy will be the subject of program reviews. Quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, and structural performance criteria and benchmarks, for 2001 will be specified in the context of the third program review. V. EXTERNALOUTLOOKANDCAPACITYTOREPAYTHEFWND 39. The balance of payments outlook for the remainder of 2000 points to the stability of foreign exchange reserves at around their present level. The surplus on the external current account is expected to fall from the high level in 1999. Higher oil prices, the reductions in customs tariffs, the import of capital goods for mining projects, and the weak outlook for the world market for phosphates will likely outweigh the expected growth in nontraditional exports and a substantial increase in foreign grants and UN compensation transfers. In contrast, the capital account surplus is expected to increase, primarily on account of the large inflow resulting from the recent sale of JTC shares. Rescheduling of interest and amortization payments under the fifth agreement with the Paris Club will continue to provide significant support for Jordan’s foreign reserves. This agreement, reached in May 1999, has since been signed by all bilateral creditors, and completion of the second review under the extended arrangement will release the second annual rescheduling tranche. 40. A continued strong foreign reserve position is projected for the medium term. The external current account is projected to move towards a modest deficit, primarily because the UN compensation transfers are anticipated to be completed by 2002, but also because the weakening of the private savings-investment balance (reflecting higher investment) is projected to outpace the improvements in the fiscal position. However, the capital account (net of privatization inflows) is anticipated to strengthen, as recent and prospective structural reforms should underpin higher FDI and portfolio inflows. In the absence of adverse shocks, and provided that sound economic and financial policies continue to be pursued beyond the program period, the ratio of Jordan’s public and publicly- guaranteed external debt to GDP would decline from 105 percent at the end of 1999 (97 percent excluding collateralized Brady bonds) to 78 percent by 2004 (Table 7). The debt service ratio would remain stable at some 20-23 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services. 26 25 Program monitoring issues are covered in paragraphs 28 and 29 of the MEFP (see Attachment I). 26 The stability of the debt service ratio despite the declining ratio of debt to GDP reflects the graduated structure of amortization schedules on Jordan’s external debt. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - 41. The prospective reduction in Jordan’s external debt burden, together with the low share of Fund credit within that debt, provide reasonable assurances regarding Jordan’s capacity to meet its financial obligations to the Fund. Obligations to the Fund were some 6% percent of public external debt at end-1999, and service of Fund credit constituted 6% percent of total external debt service. Assuming that all purchases under the extended arrangement are made according to the revised schedule, outstanding Fund credit would rise to a peak of 230 percent of quota by December 2001, when it would account for 6% percent of total public external debt. Debt service obligations to the Fund would peak at 2.7 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services in 2003, accounting for 12.2 percent of public external debt service obligations (Table 8). VI. STATISTICAL~SSUES~' 42. The availability and reliability of statistics in Jordan now appears to be more adequate for program monitoring purposes. The Jordanian Department of Statistics has begun compiling revised annual national account, quarterly GDP statistics, and a producer price index, which are being released on a more timely basis, although with some delays. Concerning fiscal statistics, a bulletin with detailed data is now published shortly after the end of each month. Trust accounts and autonomous agencies have been reclassified, and recently the authorities have requested and received technical assistance from the Fund on classifying the flows into and out of non-treasury accounts. The authorities have expressed their intention to subscribe to the Fund’s General Data Dissemination Standards and have taken most preparatory steps in this regard. VII. STAFFAPPRAISAL 43. Jordan’s economic situation now compares quite favorably with that prevailing at the start of the extended arrangement. The targets under the 1999 program were relatively modest, but this should not detract from the achievement of the authorities in implementing the first annual program under difficult circumstances. Real GDP exceeded somewhat the target despite a drought-induced drop in agricultural output, confidence in the dinar has rebounded and official external reserves by far exceeded the programmed level, the fiscal deficit has been reduced and the fiscal accounts made much more transparent. Moreover, the authorities are to be commended for their achievements in several areas of structural reform, notably in improving fiscal monitoring and control, introducing regular auctions of government securities, lowering import tariffs, and taking steps to promote greater activity in the interbank foreign exchange market. The telecom privatization represented a major step forward in the privatization area. The staff also attaches importance to the various legislative steps taken in 1999 that enabled Jordan’s accession to the WTO, and structural reforms have regained momentum. -- ” Statistical issues are discussed in greater detail in Appendix IV.

The principal remaining challenge is to raise the anemic rate of economic growth and reverse the decline in per capita income seen in recent years. Meeting this challenge in full will be difficult without improvements in the regional environment, but a further strengthening of macroeconomic policies and continued progress with structural reforms will contribute to better growth performance. 45. The program for 2000 aims at consolidating the progress achieved in the first year of the arrangement. A significant increase in growth is envisaged, aided by a turnaround in agricultural production, and maintaining low inflation and the comfortable reserve position. In support of these objectives, the authorities remain committed to fiscal and monetary discipline and to structural reforms covering the areas of taxation, energy pricing, pensions, public debt management, development of the money and capital markets, bank soundness, and privatization. The early signs are encouraging, with available indicators suggesting that economic growth is beginning to recover, with healthy growth in trade flows and tourism activity. 46. The protracted discussions on the program for 2000 reflected, in part, the adverse effect of several factors on the fiscal outlook, notably the pressures on government revenue associated with higher oil import prices and with some elements of structural reform. Under the circumstances, the staff is of the view that targeting maintenance of the overall fiscal deficit at about the same level in relation to GDP as in 1999 is acceptable, and is encouraged by the authorities’ assurances that the target will be achieved. However, the staff would like to have seen a greater readiness to pass through to domestic prices some of the increase in petroleum import costs, which would have allowed the adoption of a more ambitious fiscal program. In this regard, the staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to design with Fund technical assistance a mechanism to be put in place in 2001 for the purpose of relating domestic prices to import prices. With regard to import taxation, the staff urges the authorities to refrain from granting further exemptions, which erode the tax base and increase effective protection. 47. For the future, the staff and the authorities see as imperative the need to reduce the stock of government debt outstanding, taking into account the uncertainties about the future availability of foreign grants. Therefore, the program is based on a path for the overall fiscal deficit that would bring about a significant reduction in the public debt to GDP ratio in the coming years. However, this path will only materialize if the programmed structural reforms in the fiscal area are fully implemented, notably the conversion of the GST into a full-fledged VAT and the rationalization of the income tax system. In addition, it is necessary to activate efforts to rationalize government expenditure. Such efforts, including the envisaged reform of the government’s pension system, hold the key to a sustainable fiscal. _ . position over the longer term. 48. In the period ahead, the authorities may be confronted with a clearer trade-off between keeping official interest rates at relatively low levels and maintaining a comfortable level of reserves. Given the initial conditions for the 2000 program, the staff supports the CBJ’s stance of minimizing recourse to interest rate increases subject to the maintenance of a safe level of reserves, as reflected in the margin vis-Lvis the baseline monetary projections that has been allowed for in setting the NIR target. The staff is confident that the authorities will remain vigilant in this area, and would tighten monetary Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - conditions if this were necessary to protect the credibility of the peg of the Jordanian dinar to the U.S. dollar. The staff fully supports structural reforms envisaged for the financial sector,, which focus on prudential regulation and supervision of the banking system, and further market development. With regard to the latter, the staff attaches importance to the ongoing securitization of government debt, and urges the authorities to implement expeditiously the envisaged reform of the public debt law in order to eliminate undue constraints on public debt management. 49. The staff continues to believe that moving towards greater exchange rate flexibility would be desirable as it would facilitate adjustment in the real effective exchange rate to factors relevant to Jordan’s circumstances, rather than U.S. economic conditions, and widen the scope for an independent interest rate policy. These points are particularly relevant in current circumstances, where the ongoing tightening of monetary conditions in the United States would imply a similar trend in Jordan, possibly with an adverse impact on the incipient recovery. The staff is also concerned that the appreciation of the JD under the peg, particularly in relation to the Euro, may be detrimental to Jordan’s tradable goods sector and hinder achievement of higher economic growth through diversification. While not dismissing the authorities’ concerns over the possible adverse effects of a change in the exchange rate regime on the demand for the dinar as a conduit for savings in Jordan and neighboring territories, the staff notes that the conditions for an orderly exit from the present exchange rate regime have improved markedly over the last year. 50. Major progress has been achieved with privatization, and the next stage is ambitious. Following the successful sale of JTC shares in early 2000, the authorities are expected to proceed with the same determination with their objectives for the Royal Jordanian airline and the power companies. In the power sector, the steps that are to be taken with World Bank assistance to make the regulatory commission fully operational are an essential condition for successful privatization. The government’s commitment to privatization is demonstrated by its recent and very welcome initiative to extend the privatization program to other sectors, including the postal service. The recent approval of the Privatization Law, which establishes, inter alia, a framework for the use of the proceeds from privatization, is another important step. In this regard, the staff welcomes the government’s decision to limit such spending this year to a small share of the substantial proceeds on account of the telecom privatization, and encourages the authorities to fully integrate such spending in the regular budgetary process. 51. The availability and reliability of statistics in Jordan now appears to be more adequate for program monitoring purposes. The staff has seen particularly favorably the improvement in the flow of fiscal statistics, which are now available monthly on a comprehensive basis. Good progress has also been made in the area of national income accounts. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to subscribe to the Fund’s General Data Dissemination Standards, and the preparatory steps taken to this end. 52. The staff supports the authorities’ request for: (i) a waiver of nonobservance of a structural performance criterion for end-March 2000 relating to the submission of legislation converting the GST into a VAT; and (ii) completion of the second review.

Jordan has consulted with the Fund in accordance with paragraph 3(f) of the extended arrangement for Jordan (EBS/99/5 1, Supplement 3,4/28/99) and the second paragraph of the letter of the Minister of Finance and Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan dated March 3 1,1999. 2.

As of April 30,2000, Jordan had received 59 Bank loans and 15 IDA credits totaling US$l,850.6 million net of cancellations and terminations. All the credits and 47 of the loans have been fully disbursed. Project implementation and disbursement performance have been satisfactory. The IFC has made loans and equity investments in Jordan with total commitments of US$l87.0 million; and, in addition, about USS78.0 million in syndications. 2. The World Bank’s country assistance strategy (CAS) discussed with the Executive Board in December 1999 has four major objectives: (i) accelerating economic growth, emphasizing higher levels of private investment, export development, and tourism; (ii) promoting human development, including social protection; (iii) undertaking public sector reforms; and (iv) improving water resources management and the environment. The strategy is a continuation of providing support to government’s key objective of returning the Jordanian economy to a higher growth path and fiscal sustainability, and to reduce poverty. The strategy has been pursued through a series of policy-based adjustment loans to support structural reforms in energy (USS80 million, 1997) agriculture (US$SO million,1 997), and economic reform and development (ERDL I, US$SO million, 1995, ERDL II, US$lZO million, 1996, and ERDL III, US$l20 million, 1999). Japan, Germany, Italy, and the EU each cofinanced one or more of these loans. An action program in trade, finance, the regulatory environment, and private sector development formulated in connection with the ERDL series of adjustment loans has by and large been successfully completed. The centerpiece of the new CAS (2000-02) would be a series of three single-tranche adjustment loans to support public sector reforms. 3. The World Bank is supporting the government’s direct interventions to fight poverty through the Social Productivity Program. This broad program is addressing the problems of the poorest segment of the population through a combination of infrastructure improvements in poor communities and refugee camps, an innovative income transfer program, a program to match job training efforts to the needs of the economy, and micro-enterprise support. The Bank loans are directly supporting the community infrastructure and job training programs, while Bank’s technical services have helped in the design of the other components of the program. The World Bank also continues to address critical physical, institutional, and policy constraints through investment projects in tourism, water supply, and health sector reforms. Assistance is also planned for export and investment promotion, agricultural services, and water and wastewater management. Provided the government’s adjustment and reform programs stay on track, the World Bank expects to be able to commit approximately US$300-US$450 million in new lending to Jordan during 2000-02. 4. The World Bank’s nonlending and economic and sector work provides analytical support for the government’s reform programs. Recent work has dealt with privatization, trade incentives, financial development, the role of government, the nature of and response to poverty, the needs and opportunities facing the private sector, the water sector, the health sector, and the higher education sector. The World Bank has recently discussed with the Government to undertake a joint economic growth study which is proposed to be started in Fall 2000 and completed by Spring 200 1.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Jordan On [July 251, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Jordan at the same time as it completed the second review of the program supported under the Extended Fund Facility. Background Jordan’s economic performance in 1999 and early 2000 was generally satisfactory. After the difficult conditions of 1998 and early 1999, the authorities were successful in reinforcing confidence in the national currency, as signaled by the impressive rebound in international reserves to nearly US$2 billion (7 months of imports) by end-1999, and rapid growth in the demand for money; following the receipt of large privatization proceeds in early-2000, international reserves now exceed US$2.5 billion. With the return of confidence and the strengthening of the external position, the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) was able to reduce its benchmark 3-month CD rate to about 6 percent by the end of 1999, more than 400 basis points below the level prevailing at the start of the extended arrangement; retail interest rates have begun to come down as well. Inflation continued to be very low. The fiscal deficit target for 1999 was achieved with a margin: the overall fiscal deficit before grants amounted to 7.3 percent of GDP, compared with the program target of 7.9 percent of GDP (and a deficit of 10.4 percent of GDP in 1998); the overall deficit after grants in 3999 was equivalent to 3.6 percent of GDP. ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of --. the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-46- The external current account including grants registered a surplus of 5.2 percent of GDP, and was in balance excluding grants, while the trade deficit was narrower than projected. Strong private capital inflows started in the second quarter of the year as confidence returned, contributing to a substantial capital account surplus. Available indicators suggest that these trends have continued in the early part of 2000, with some hopeful signs of a pick-up in economic activity. Significant progress was achieved since the start of the program in several areas of structural reform. In particular, the privatization program has gained momentum. Important milestones in 1999 include the awarding of a private management contract to run the operations of the Water Authority of Jordan in the Amman area, and the agreement with a foreign-led consortium to operate, upgrade, and extend the Aqaba railway. Most prominently, in January 2000 the government concluded the sale of a major stake in the telecommunications company to a foreign-led consortium for about US$500 million. In the area of government debt management, regular auctions of government securities were introduced as the main form of domestic borrowing for the budget. In the trade area, the maximum import tariff rate was reduced to first from 40 percent to 35 percent and then to 30 percent, rates on numerous imported inputs were lowered, and excise taxes on cars were cut by almost half; Jordan became a member of the WTO in April 2000. Nonetheless, economic growth continued to be disappointing. Jordan’s real GDP is estimated to have increased by only I .6 percent in 1999, in part because of the effect of severe drought on agricultural output; this rate of growth was better than programmed, but still unsatisfactory given the high rate of population growth. Achieving rapid growth, while preserving the gains in macroeconomic stabilization and reducing Jordan’s vulnerability to external shocks, remains the main challenge of economic policy. To this end the authorities are pursuing a comprehensive medium-term strategy based on prudent macroeconomic policies and ambitious structural reforms. They are confident that economic growth will reach to at least 3 percent in 2000 and accelerate in subsequent years. Meanwhile, inflation should remain low, and Jordan’s international reserves will be maintained at the current comfortable level. The government will continue to exercise fiscal restraint, and target a budget deficit before grants of 7.0 percent of GDP; including a limited amount of spending out of receipts from privatization, the overall fiscal deficit is projected at 7.5 percent of GDP before grants, and 2.7 percent of GDP after grants. In coming years the government intends to set the fiscal deficit on a declining path to help lift Jordan’s heavy debt burden. Integral to the authorities’ growth strategy is a wide-ranging structural reform agenda, which will cover the areas of taxation and other government revenues, public debt management, the public pension system, bank soundness, and privatization. For example, the Jordanian parliament has already begun debating legislation that would transform the current General Sales Tax into a Value Added Tax, and by the end of the year the government intends to introduce legislation to rationalize the income tax system and update the legal framework governing public debt management. The authorities have recognized the importance of reforming the public pension system so as to promote savings and labor market efficiency, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-47- will formulate a detailed plan of action in this area. A modernized Banking Law is close to being enacted, and the central bank is strengthening provisioning requirements on impaired loans. The privatization program in 2000-01 will focus on the national airline and the power sector, and may be extended over time, for example, in the water and postal sectors. Executive Board Assessment Public information Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF’s assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.

Dear Mr. Kijhler: The attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies reviews recent economic and policy developments, updates the medium-term framework set out at the time of the first review under the extended arrangement, and specifies the government’s macroeconomic and structural policies constituting the 2000 program. The government believes that performance in relation to the 1999 program was successful, and that the policies proposed for the current year are consistent with sound medium-term economic objectives. Accordingly, we hereby request completion of the second review. The program envisaged that legislation modifying the General Sales Tax (GST) to convert it into a value added tax would be submitted to parliament before the end of March 2000. However, the last ordinary session of parliament had to consider first other amendments to the GST law in the context of Jordan’s accession to the WTO. As approval of the WTO- related amendments took longer than expected, submission of those related to the VAT was delayed. We have recently submitted them to an extraordinary session of parliament, and they are currently under consideration. On this basis, the government requests a waiver for the non-observance of the end-March structural performance criterion. The government stands ready to take, in consultation with the Fund staff, any additional measures that may be required to achieve the program’s objectives. The government will also continue to provide the Fund staff with any information that may be relevant to the assessment of policy implementation and performance under the program. Sincerely yours, IS/ IS/ Michel Marto Ziad Fariz Minister of Finance Governor Ministry of Finance Central Bank of Jordan Attachment: Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50- ATTACHMENT JORDAN Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies, 2000 1. This Memorandum reviews key economic and policy developments thus far under the extended arrangement, updates the medium-term framework, and specifies the government’s macroeconomic and structural policies constituting the 2000 economic program. As detailed below, the government believes that performance under the 1999 program was successful, and that the policies proposed for the current year are consistent with sound medium-term economic objectives. I. DEVELOPMENTS~NDERTHE 1999 MACROECONOMICPROGRAM 2. The government is satisfied with the progress made in strengthening macroeconomic policies in 1999, although economic growth was adversely affected by the severe drought and the continued impediments to regional trade. The adoption of the new program in early 1999, and its steady implementation on a broad policy front, contributed most notably to a rebound in the demand for the Jordanian dinar, which was translated into a substantial buildup of official foreign exchange reserves and lower interest rates. At the same time, year- on-year CPI inflation amounted to only 0.6 percent in 1999, substantially below the 1998 level (3.1 percent). Real GDP growth is estimated at 1.6 percent, compared with the original forecast of 1.2 percent, as better-than-projected performance of non-agricultural sectors more than offset a 20 percent decline in agricultural output due to the drought. 3. The fiscal target for 1999 was achieved with a comfortable margin. The overall fiscal deficit amounted to 7.4 percent of GDP, compared with the program target of 7.9 percent of GDP. The deficit after grants was equivalent to 3.6 percent of GDP, 0.6 percent of GDP below the program projection; also excluding rescheduled interest from expenditure, the deficit amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP. This, combined with an increase in external loan disbursements, contributed to a sharp reduction in the government’s domestic borrowing requirement, from 6.2 percent of GDP in 1998 to 1.6 percent in 1999. 4. Prudent monetary policy during 1999 contributed importantly to the recovery in confidence and the rebound in the demand for the dinar after the uncertainties of late 1998 and early 1999. The principal source of monetary expansion, which totaled 12 percent over the year, was a rapid accumulation of net foreign assets by the banking system, reflected mainly in a pronounced growth of dinar deposits. The banking system’s net domestic assets increased only marginally due to low recourse to bank borrowing by the budget and relatively slow growth in credit to the private sector. The Central Bank of Jordan’s (CBJ) net foreign asset position strengthened substantially, while its net domestic assets contracted, reflecting the absorption of liquidity by the CBJ and the low government borrowing needs. With the return of confidence and the strengthening of the external position, the CBJ was able to reduce the benchmark 3-month CD rate to about 6 percent, more than 400 basis points below the level prevailing early in the year; retail interest rates began to decline as well.

Regarding the balance of payments, the external current account recorded a surplus of 5.2 percent of GDP in 1999. This high surplus included UN compensation transfers of 3.3 percent of GDP to Jordanians who had incurred losses stemming from the Gulf crisis. The trade deficit was narrower than projected, as lower growth of exports of phosphates, fertilizer, and agricultural products was more than offset by lower imports, especially in the first quarter. The current account outturn also reflected a higher than anticipated level of foreign grants. Strong private capital inflows started in the second quarter of the year as confidence returned, contributing to a substantial capital account surplus:Official foreign exchange reserves reached an unprecedented US$2 billion (almost 7 months of imports and more than 25 percent of JD broad money) by the end of 1999; reserves were boosted in early 2000 by the sale of shares in the Jordan Telecommunications Company (JTC), and they now stand at US$2.6 billion. II. IMPLEMENTATIONOFSTRUCTURALPOLICIES 6. Over the past year, the government has made sustained efforts in structural reform, emphasizing fiscal transparency, steps to raise efficiency in the public sector, financial sector reform, trade liberalization, and privatization. l In the fiscal area, the government accounts with the banking system have been reclassified, and the fiscal monitoring unit created last March is publishing a monthly report on budgetary developments. 0 Regarding the public sector, the operations in the Amman area of the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) have been placed under private management, and the Aqaba Railway has been leased to a foreign company. Moreover, as a prelude to privatization, the Royal Jordanian airline (RJ) and the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) are undergoing major restructurings. 0 In the area of financial sector reform, we introduced last fall a regular series of government securities auctions, which has become the main form of domestic borrowing for the budget, and allowed the stock of non-interest bearing credit from the CBJ to government to be reduced significantly. In an effort to promote competition between banks and reduce lending rates, we have recently required banks to publish their prime lending rates, deregulated their commissions, and reduced reserve requirements (from 14 percent to 12 percent). In October, to help stimulate the interbank foreign exchange market, the CBJ reintroduced a spread of 0.3 percent between its buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar (it had bought and sold dollars at its official selling rate since 1996); since then, the interbank foreign exchange market has become noticeably more active. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - 0 In the trade area, the maximum import tariff rate was reduced to 35 percent in July 1999 (from 40 percent), and a further reduction to 30 percent was implemented in April 2000. Tariffs on imported inputs have been cut to low levels or eliminated, and taxes on imported cars have been cut by almost half. 7. Jordan became a member of the WTO on April 11,200O. As part of the membership process we have undertaken several reforms, notably enactment by parliament of legislation harmonizing GST rates on domestic and imported goods, amendments to the customs law, and passage of a new law on intellectual property rights. 8. The privatization program has picked up momentum. Following the privatization of Jordan Cement Factories in late 1998, the Jordan Investment Company (JIC) divested its shares in 10 companies during 1999 and, in the largest privatization to date in Jordan, the government sold last January a 40 percent stake in JTC to a French-led consortium that will play a leading role in the company’s management. In addition, the Social Security Corporation bought an 8 percent stake in the company, and a further 1 percent of shares will be sold to the employees. Meanwhile, enabling steps have been taken for the sale of RJ and privatization in the power sector. The legislation necessary to create the RJ airline company and privatize it was presented to parliament late last year and is currently under consideration. Concurrently, bids for the duty-free shops and for the flight training operations have been received, and potential strategic partners for the airline have been approached. In the power sector, the above-noted restructuring of NEPCO has entailed the transfer of its former generation and distribution functions to two newly created companies--the Central Electricity Generation Company (CEGCO) and the Electricity Distribution Company (EDCO), which operate independently and are targeted for privatization. Moreover, legislation was passed that will allow a strengthening of the regulatory framework for the sector, and the government has received bids from prospective independent power producers (IPPs) for construction of a power plant. III. MEDIUM-TERM SETTINCANDPOLICIESFOR 2000 9. The government’s economic program aims to raise substantially economic growth, reduce unemployment, and fight poverty. Maintaining financial stability and enhancing the environment for private sector activity are essential for improving growth performance. Accordingly, we remain committed to bringing down the fiscal deficit, lowering the public debt burden, and continuing to pursue a prudent monetary policy as essential elements of our strategy to increase investor confidence in the Jordanian economy. In addition, the government will further advance its wide-ranging program of structural reforms. -._ 10. As regards the medium-term macroeconomic outlook, we hope that real GDP growth will accelerate to at least 3 percent in 2000 and to 4 percent or more by 2002, on the basis of a rebound in agricultural production, the impact of large mining projects, development of the tourism sector, and investment stimulated by the structural reforms. Favorable developments in the region could enable substantially higher growth to be achieved. Inflation should remain Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - , subdued throughout the period. Following the large increases during 1999 and early 2000, official foreign exchange reserves are targeted to remain at comfortable levels. 11. A prudent fiscal stance is central for the achievement of our macroeconomic objectives. A key consideration in this regard is the need to diminish steadily Jordan’s high public debt burden. However, we are also mindful that an unduly rapid fiscal adjustment would have a negative effect on growth and employment. Taking these considerations into account, we have targeted a budget deficit before grants of 7.0 percent of GDP in 2000 (2.2 percent of GDP after grants). Looking ahead, we intend to reduce the budget deficit before grants to 6.0 percent of GDP in 2001 and 5.0 percent of GDP by 2002. In addition to the budget deficits, there will be limited spending from privatization proceeds as detailed in paragraph 23. On this basis, the ratio of total public and publicly guaranteed debt to GDP should decline substantially over the same period. The government believes that the proposed path for the deficit is appropriately ambitious if account is taken of the budgetary costs associated with structural reforms and of the likely levels of grant finance in future years. A. Macroeconomic Policies 12. In the absence of measures, the fiscal position ran the risk of deteriorating substantially in 2000. This was due, most importantly, to the sharp increase in the import price of oil and the associated reduction in the projected “oil surplus” accruing to the budget, by about 2 % percent of GDP compared with 1999, which was not fully anticipated at the time of the budget exercise. In addition, several important structural reforms-the reduction in customs tariffs, the privatization of JTC, and the issuance of government securities to replace interest-free advances from the CBJ-will result in net losses to the budget of about 1 percent of GDP. The budget adopted by parliament in January contained measures that would offset these losses by about 1 percent of GDP, including elimination of the remaining food subsidy, increases in a number of fees, and land sales by the Jordan Valley Authority; subsequently, the government has introduced a tax on airline tickets and increased jet fuel prices, with a combined yield of JD 12 million (0.2 percent of GDP) in 2000. To close the remaining gap in relation to the budget deficit target, we are committed to expenditure savings relative to the budgetary allocations totaling 2.0 percent of GDP, evenly split between the public investment program and current expenditure. In the first quarter of 2000, the budget deficit amounted to 1.3 percent of annual GDP, and we are confident that the deficit target for the year will be reached. 13. As regards the financing of the budget deficit, all domestic borrowing is being conducted according to the announced schedule of government securities auctions. We are committed to auctioning, during 2000, at least JD 644 million in treasury bills and JD 80 million in treasury bonds, as a result of which the outstanding stocks of these securities will increase, respectively, by JD 90 million and JD 40 million by the end of the year. Auction proceeds in excess of the government’s domestic financing needs are being allocated to the retirement of interest free advances obtained in the past from the CBJ as a further step towards their eventual elimination. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - 14. Monetary and in particular interest rate policy will continue to be guided primarily by the objective of maintaining the stability of the Jordanian dinar. Consistent with this approach, we have recently raised official interest rates slightly in reaction to the rise in U.S. interest rates, which has contributed to the stability of international reserves. For the year as a whole, we will target an increase in the CBJ’s net international reserves by at least JD 258 million (Table l), largely reflecting receipts from abroad related to the JTC privatization. Since the recovery of money demand after the uncertainties of early 1999 is believed to have run its course, and based on developments in the first four months of 2000, broad money growth is expected to decelerate this year to about 8 % percent. This would still allow for ample credit to the private sector to finance the prospective pick-up in investment and business activity. Consistent with the objectives for monetary policy and international reserves, and in the light of the reduction in reserve requirements as of March, the net domestic assets of the CBJ are expected to contract over the year by at least JD 262 million (Table 1). With the decline in money market interest rates over the past year, we expect that commercial bank lending rates will come down further during the next few months, a trend that should encourage economic expansion. 15. In 2000, the surplus on the external current account is expected to fall from the high level in 1999. Higher oil prices, the reductions in customs tariffs, the import of capital goods for mining projects, and the weak outlook for the world market for phosphates will likely outweigh the expected growth in nontraditional exports and a substantial increase in foreign grants. Indeed, the trade deficit in the first four months of 2000 was US$150 million larger than in the corresponding period in 1999, with imports rebounding by 17 percent and exports rising by 3 % percent in value terms. These factors will be significantly offset by a higher inflow of UN compensation transfers in 2000, as evidenced by developments in the first quarter, when US$2 19 million of such transfers were received. In contrast, the capital account surplus is expected to increase, primarily on account of the large inflow resulting from the recent sale of JTC shares. This places us in a position to use debt buyback operations at discount and debt swap arrangements, as favorable opportunities for such transactions arise, to reduce the debt and interest burden. Given the high level of official foreign exchange reserves and the outlook for the balance of payments, the program will target the maintenance of reserves at around their present level. B. Structural Policies 16. We envisage that the pace of structural reforms will intensify in the period ahead as we build on the foundation laid down since early 1999. This will touch, inter alia, the areas of taxation, energy pricing, pensions, public debt management, development of the money and capital markets, bank soundness, and privatization. Fiscal reforms 17. In the area of tax policy, we intend to convert the General Sales Tax (GST) into a full-fledged VAT and to reform the income tax. The government has submitted to parliament during the extraordinary session convened on May 21 the “second stage” Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 55 - amendment to the GST law, which will convert this tax into a VAT. According to the proposed amendment, the list of exemptions under the GST will be reduced substantially. The amendments to the income tax law are being finalized in time for their submission to parliament at the start of the next ordinary session in November, with a view to implementing the reform in the context of the budget for 2001. Their purpose is to rationalize the income tax system by harmonizing and simplifying tax rates, and broadening the tax base. 18. Recent developments in the oil market have demonstrated the vulnerability of the budget to fluctuations in oil prices. We are requesting Fund technical assistance to help design a mechanism to address this vulnerability. We expect that the government will adopt later this year an oil pricing strategy drawing on this study. 19. The public pension system, in its current form, poses a steadily increasing burden on the budget. In recognition of these drawbacks, the government is preparing a reform of the public pension system, with the ultimate goal of bringing public sector employees within the framework of the Social Security Corporation (SSC), while preserving the financial viability of the SSC. A draft strategy will be prepared by the Ministry of Finance to be presented to the cabinet by end-December 2000. 20. The government is at the early stages of designing, with technical assistance from the World Bank, public sector reforms whose primary objectives would be to improve the delivery of public services, in particular in the areas of health and education. In this context, action plans are being prepared in the areas of, inter alia, service delivery, financial management, procurement procedures, human resource management, institutional accountability, and judicial reform. Financial sector reforms 21. Priority is being attached to the fUrther development of the money and capital markets. As noted, we are implementing during 2000 a schedule for auctioning government securities within the limits of the public debt law. However, as these limits hinder public debt management, we intend to prepare and submit to parliament, at the start of the next ordinary session in November, a revised public debt law that will provide a more comprehensive framework for the issue or assumption of public debt in all forms within prudent limits, and rationalize the tax treatment of different instruments for government borrowing. Concerning the interbank foreign exchange market, we will make merely indicative rather than mandatory the CBJ’s announced exchange rates of the Jordanian dinar against currencies other than the U.S. dollar; and increase the minimum size of foreign exchange transactions between the CBJ and commercial banks. To upgrade the large value payment system, we plan to begin installing a real time gross settlement system later this year, and have it operational in the first half of 2001. 22. We will continue to strengthen the prudential regulation and supervision of the banking system so as to promote the sound development of the sector. In particular, we will introduce a new regulation defining commercial banks’ maximum foreign currency exposure relative to their capital, in accordance with international best practice. We are also phasing in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 56 - over three years a requirement for banks to classify as impaired, and make provisions against, all loans more than 90 days past due, as against 180 days previously; already in 2000 we have reduced the criterion to 150 days past due. The current special session of parliament is considering the new banking, deposit insurance, and insurance companies laws. Privatization 23. The government regards privatization as one of the centerpieces of its structural policy agenda. The Privatization Law just approved by the Lower House of parliament establishes a Privatization Council to oversee the privatization strategy and to decide on the use of privatization proceeds, an Executive Privatization Commission, and a Privatization Proceeds Fund. It also specifies the purposes for which privatization proceeds can be spent, namely: infrastructure projects; social programs; and support to workers affected by the privatization process. Consistent with the government’s strategy to avoid unsustainable increases in public expenditure as a result of privatization, the bulk of the proceeds will be invested in financial assets or used to retire public debt. However, in support of its growth and poverty reduction objectives, the government intends to use up to 15 percent of the proceeds for high quality spending on infrastructure and social sectors. In this context, an amount of up to JD 27 million could be spent in 2000; in selecting projects, we will ensure that due consideration is given to the implications for future recurrent costs. Spending in later years out of privatization proceeds will be the subject of the next program review in light of the amount spent in 2000, possible additional privatization proceeds, and the opportunities for debt buybacks. At this stage, we project that the overall fiscal deficit, which includes spending out of privatization proceeds, will not exceed 7.5 percent of GDP in 2000, 6.3 percent of GDP in 2001, and 5.3 percent of GDP in 2002. Spending from the Privatization Proceeds Fund will be specified in the budget law, subject to the normal budgetary audit procedures, and reported to parliament. 24. Following the successtil sale of JTC shares in early 2000, the main focus of the privatization program will be on the Royal Jordanian airline and the power sector. Concerning RJ, we hope to complete the sale of its duty free subsidiary by end-July, of the flight training subsidiary by end-September, and of its catering, engine overhaul, and aircraft maintenance subsidiaries, as well as of various shareholdings by the end of the year. Proceeds from these sales will go to retire RJ’s domestic debt. RJ flight operations were profitable in 1999, and we are continuing to improve its route structure and financial structure so as to increase future profitability. We are actively marketing the airline to potential strategic partners, but if no attractive partner can be found we will pursue the option of offering shares to a consortium of financial investors and airline management consultants. In the near future we expect parliament to revoke Decree Number 10 of 1969 (which chartered RJ as a public entity), so that RJ can be formally corporatized prior to privatization. 25. The next steps in the reform of the power sector are selecting the IPP, completing the process of separating EDCO and CEGCO from NEPCO, and putting in place the regulatory commission. The IPP will be chosen by end-July, which will allow groundbreaking for the new power plant in early 2001. The government has retained a consultant to review the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - separation effected last year of the assets of NEPCO, CEGCO, and EDCO, and to help design a definitive power purchasing agreement between CEGCO and NEPCO that will be in effect in early 2001. Meanwhile, the govemment is in the process of retaining an advisor to help in specifying, by the end of the year, the steps that will be needed to make the regulatory commission fully operational, and the modalities for privatization of CEGCO and EDCO. 26. We are also pursuing privatization schemes in a number of other sectors. We are already in the process of corporatizing the operation of Ministry of Industry and Trade storage facilities such as silos and cold storage units with a view to their privatization later this year or early in 2001. The JIC expects to sell its shares in an additional eight companies during 2000. WAJ is preparing to offer a private management contract for its operations in the Wadi Mussa region, and a build-operate-transfer arrangement for the development of a waste-water treatment facility in the region of Amman; WAJ management is also studying the scope for the introduction of private management and capital into other projects, such as a desalination plant. Before year-end, we will conduct a preparatory study for the awarding of a private management contract for operation of the postal service. Social policies 27. The Social Productivity Program remains the cornerstone of our anti-poverty efforts. To ensure effective implementation, a special unit has been established at the Ministry of Planning to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate the implementation of the program’s four component&he National Aid Fund, the Small and Micro Enterprises Development Program, the Training and Employment Support Program, and the Community Infrastructure Development Program. In addition, a Family Income Supplement scheme has been introduced with the objective of bridging the gap between the current income levels of poor working households and the absolute poverty line. IV. PROGRAMMONITORING 28. Purchases under the extended arrangement will continue to be subject to the observance of performance criteria, completion of program reviews, and a continuous performance criterion on the non-accumulation of new external payments arrears. In addition, the government will not impose restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, introduce multiple currency practices, conclude bilateral payments arrangements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Article of Agreement, or impose import restrictions for balance of payments reasons. 29. The quantitative performance criteria for end-September and end-December 2000 are specified in Table 1. They apply to changes in net international reserves and net domestic assets of the CBJ; the change in net bank claims on government; spending out of privatization proceeds; stock of public and publicly guaranteed short-term external debt; and the contracting of nonconcessional medium- and long-term public and publicly guaranteed external debt (with a sub-ceiling on the contracting of debt with a maturity of up to and including 5 years). Table 1 also specifies indicative targets for the budget deficit after grants Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 58 - and for domestic budgetary revenue excluding grants and privatization receipts. The program also includes structural performance criteria and benchmarks, which are specified in Table 2. Progress in implementing the domestic oil pricing strategy will be the subject of program reviews. Quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, and structural performance criteria and benchmarks, for 2001 will be specified in the context of the third program review.
