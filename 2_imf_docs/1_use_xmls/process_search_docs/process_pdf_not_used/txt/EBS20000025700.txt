The staff team consisted of Mr. Harris (head), Mr. Lazar, Ms. Adenauer, Mr. OssiC, Ms. Le (all AFR), Ms. Carpenter (INS-Assistant), and Mr. Le Bouder, the Fund’s Senior Resident Representative in Guinea. Mr. Larbi and Ms. Adam of the World Bank participated fully in the mission. Mr. Plant (AFR) participated in the first half of the mission. Mr. Qndo Ma%, Alternate Executive Director for Guinea, joined the mission during the second week and participated fully in the discussions during his stay. The Guinean representatives in these discussions included Mr. SidimC, the Prime Minister; Mr. Camara, Minister of Economy and Finance; Mr. Bah, Governor of the Central Bank; and other senior officials. The mission also met with the Ministers of Health, Social Affairs, Public Works and Transportation, Education, and Fisheries. The Alternate Executive Director, the Mission Chief, and the Senior Resident Representative were also received by President ContC. A three-year arrangement under the ESAF, in an amount equivalent to SDR 70.8 million (90 percent of Ninth Review of Quotas), was approved on January 13, 1997. The third annual arrangement under the PRGF was approved on December 2 1, 1999, and the first loan thereunder, in an amount equivalent to SDR 7.9 million, was disbursed soon thereafter. As the original three-year arrangement would have expired on January 12,2000, prior to the date envisaged for the disbursement of the second and third loans under the third annual arrangement, an extension of the three-year commitment period to January 12,200l has been granted. The present review will therefore be the last under the arrangement before its expiration, and so no further performance criteria have been established as conditions of disbursement of the third loan, which will not be requested. If the second loan is disbursed as envisaged, Guinea’s outstanding use of Fund resources would rise from SDR 90.1 million (84.1 percent of Eleventh Review of Quotas) at end-October 2000 to SDR 98 million (91.5 percent of quota) at end-December 2000. In completing the 1999 Article IV consultation on December 2 1, 1999, Executive Directors welcomed the prompt remedial actions taken to counter the adverse effects of exogenous shocks on the economy, but stressed the need to create a sound policy environment for sustained growth. They noted the importance of reinforcing fiscal discipline and expenditure control, as well as durably enhancing revenue performance. They welcomed progress in banking sector reform and stressed the need to maintain a realistic exchange rate. Directors also observed that governance problems remained an important issue in Guinea and urged the government to demonstrate its commitment to tight corruption, including through establishment of an anticonuption committee, and the strengthening of the judicial system. The Guinean authorities have agreed to the publication of the staff report, and the letter of intent and memorandum of economic and financial policies.

The third annual arrangement under the PRGF was approved on December 2 1, 1999. The three-year commitment period has been extended from January 12,200O to January 12,200l. A new three-year PRGF arrangement is to be discussed with the authorities in early 200 1. Recent economic and financial developments l Output growth is projected at 4.5 percent in 2000, up from 3.3 percent in 1999, while average inflation is projected to rise from 4.6 percent in 1999 to 7.7 percent in 2000, reflecting higher oil prices and the continued depreciation of the Guinean franc, The external current account deficit is projected to improve from 6.9 percent to 5.9 percent of GDP. Guinea met most of its debt service obligations in 2000, but accumulated some arrears by continuing to pay the Paris Club on the basis of the 1997 rescheduling agreement that expired at end-1999. l Economic and financial developments in the latter half of 1999 and during 2000 were, for the most part, adversely affected by exogenous events: the deterioration of the security situation on its borders; a pronounced deterioration in its terms of trade; and large shortfalls in expected external assistance, reflecting in part delays in implementing agreed policy measures. l Revenue shortfalls in early 2000 further reduced available resources. Through ad hoc revenue measures and draconian expenditure compression, the authorities met key fiscal and monetary targets of the program for end-March 2000, though the net foreign assets target was missed. However, the underlying fiscal situation was unsustainable, and key structural reforms were delayed. Two quantitative and two structural performance criteria were not observed at end-March 2000. l The completion of the first program review has thus been delayed, and an interim program through end-September was set up, with monthly fiscal and monetary objectives and additional structural measures. Implementation of this interim program by end-September was largely satisfactory and the program was brought back on track. l The public finance situation will remain difficult through end-2000. The primary surplus is projected at 2.9 percent of GDP, slightly below the revised program level. The budget deficit in the last quarter of 2000 will be financed by an increase in domestic bank credit to the government, to be repaid at the end of the first quarter of 2001. Broad money is projected Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- to expand by 20.9 percent, and the net domestic assets of the banking system by 24 percent, owing to the sharp rise in credit to the government. Outlook for 2001 l Output growth is projected at 4.5 percent in 2001, and average inflation at 9.5 percent, though it should slow to below 5 percent by year-end. The current account deficit is projected to widen to 6.5 percent of GDP, reflecting higher import demand. l Agreement was reached on the key elements of the budget for 200 1, and on additional poverty-related spending to be financed by the resources likely to be made available from debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. The primary surplus of the baseline budget is projected to rise from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2000 to 3.7 percent, and the overall deficit to decline from 5.3 percent to 4 percent of GDP. The additional poverty-related spending will be integrated with the baseline budget into the Finance Law for 2001 to be approved by the Parliament. l The authorities have prepared the interim poverty reduction strategy paper, and have agreed with the staffs of the Fund and the World Bank on a series of quantified intermediate outcome indicators, as well as triggers for the HIPC completion point. Issues raised in the staff appraisal The staff appraisal underscores the need to: l Sustain consistently the reform effort and avoid the policy slippages of past years. l Strengthen revenue mobilization by rectifying weaknesses in the taxation of public enterprises and in customs, reducing abuses of the system of flat-rate taxation of the informal sector, and gradually eliminating the pervasive exemptions. l Press ahead with public enterprise restructuring and privatization. l Improve further the conduct of monetary policy and the efficiency of the foreign exchange market. l Achieve further improvements in public accountability and governance, including through reform of the judiciary. l Deepen the participation of civil society in the preparation of the poverty reduction strategy, and expand it to relevant areas of policy formulation and monitoring.

In a letter to the Managing Director, dated December 6,2000, and in the accompanying memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) (Appendix I, Attachment), the government of Guinea describes the implementation of its economic and financial program for the period October 1999-September 2000, supported by the Fund through the third annual Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, as well as the steps it intends to follow to ensure the attainment of the objectives for the rest of the period covered under the third annual arrangement and for 200 1. Guinea’s adjustment effort has also received considerable support from the World Bank. A new structural adjustment operation (SAC IV) is expected to be approved by the Bank in the first quarter of 2001. Details of Guinea’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are summarized in Appendices II and III, respectively. 2. Statistics are weak in Guinea. An April 2000 STA mission noted important deficiencies in balance of payments, national accounts, and price statistics, and made recommendations to rectify the shortcomings. Available fiscal data are not sufficiently comprehensive, due to the existence of extrabudgetary accounts.’ They also still suffer from difficulties related to expenditure tracking, although these are being resolved, in particular with the introduction of the computerized expenditure tracking system. A money and banking statistics mission visited Conakry in November 2000 (see Appendix IV). II. ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSANDPROGRAMIMPLEMENTATIONIN 1999-20002 A. Overview 3. Economic and financial developments in Guinea in the latter half of 1999 and during 2000 were adversely affected by exogenous developments, as well as by endogenous factors, including the late adjustment of domestic petroleum prices and delays in implementing key measures. First, the resumption of the civil war in Sierra Leone in late 1999 led to a further substantial inflow of retigees into Guinea, as well as to repeated incursions of rebel forces from both Sierra Leone and Liberia, which increased in intensity and frequency beginning in ’ See also footnote 9 below. 2 In January 2000, President ContC appointed a new Minister of Finance and, in June 2000, he reshuffled his cabinet, eliminating the Ministry of Planning and Cooperation, whose i%nctions were reallocated between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Local elections held in June 2000 were won decisively by the ruling party, but the opposition accused the government of electoral fraud, and several people died in subsequent civil unrest. Parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for November 26,2000, have been postponed. A new date has not yet been set. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- August 2000.3 In response, the Guinean authorities, with encouragement but little financial support from the donor community, have increased their contribution to the ECOMOG forces (the military branch of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)) in Sierra Leone, and redeployed troops to the borders.4 The cost of these operations has increased the strain on Guinea’s public finances. 4. Second, Guinea has suffered a pronounced deterioration in its terms of trade over the past 18 months, caused by the decline in the world prices of Guinea’s main export products-bauxite, alumina, and gold-as well as the sharp rise in prices of imported petroleum products. The result has been shortfalls in mining and petroleum product taxes;’ a deterioration of the external current account; a weakening of economic activity; and increased pressure on domestic prices and the exchange rate. 5. Third, since the beginning of 1999, budgetary assistance from donors has fallen considerably short of expectations. In large part, this shortfall reflected delays on the part of the Guinean authorities in implementing agreed measures.6 At the same time, the government continued to meet most of its external debt-service obligations, resulting in a projected net resource outflow (excluding project aid) in 2000 of GF 12 1 billion (2.3 percent of GDP). As a result, the supply of foreign exchange in the official auction market has been very tight, exerting downward pressure on the exchange rate, which the central bank attempted to counter through periodic sales from its reserves. This situation has been further aggravated 3 One UN staff worker in the refugee camps was killed during one of the cross-border raids. As a result, as of September 17,2000, all UN-led operations have been suspended in the regions bordering Liberia, and UN staff have been evacuated to Conakry. 4 By end- September 2000, Guinea’s outlays for the ECOMOG peacekeeping troops amounted to GF 26 billion, compared with revised annual allocations of GF 3 1 billion under the interim program, and of GF 19 billion in the original program. The authorities expect the amount to increase to GF 53 billion by the end of the year. 5 The petroleum tax rate in Guinea is the difference between the fixed retail sales price and the cost of petroleum products (including, for example, import costs and the guaranteed margins to importers and distributors). The failure to adjust the retail sales prices to take account of the sharp increase in import costs over the past 18 months thus severely squeezed domestic petroleum tax revenue. 6 Moreover, new disbursements of budgetary assistance from the European Union (EU) were suspended in late 1999, pending the results of an audit of the use of resources provided to Guinea over the period 1993-99. The audit was completed in November 2000, and Guinea is expected to reimburse to the EU GF 14.8 billion for ineligible expenditures. The authorities have also agreed to a program of structural measures designed to prevent the recurrence of such problems, some of which are part of ongoing reforms of public finance management (see Box 1, and paragraph 7 of the memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP), Appendix I, Attachment). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- since August 2000 by the additional requirements of foreign exchange for military procurement. 6. The Guinean authorities thus faced a very difficult situation with respect to the fiscal and monetary objectives of the third annual PRGF arrangement for the first half of the program period (October 1999 to March 2000), as available resources were considerably lower than assumed under the program. This lack of resources not only reflected the lack of external financing, but was also due to a large shortfall during the first months of 2000 in petroleum tax revenues (the direct result of the failure to adjust domestic retail prices promptly to the increase in import prices of petroleum products), as well as to weak value- added tax (VAT) collections from key public enterprises. At the same time, military spending was running at almost twice the rate envisaged under the program. 7. In an attempt to meet the program’s fiscal objectives for end-March 2000, the authorities implemented during February-March 2000 a series of ad hoc measures to raise revenue,’ as well as a draconian compression of expenditures. Using a monthly, forward- looking cash-flow plan introduced in February 2000, the government limited current expenditure to the payment of civil service salaries, expenditures for the ECOMOG peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone, and external debt-service payments, There was some repayment of domestic arrears from 1999, but no expenditure commitments were made either for government consumption of water, electricity, telecommunication services in the first quarter of 2000 (thus incurring arrears to these suppliers), or for goods and services in any line ministries, including in the priority areas of education and health. 8. These measures enabled the authorities to meet the end-March 2000 performance criterion on the central government primary balance, as well as those on reserve money and net bank credit to the government. However, the floor on net foreign assets of the central bank (also a performance criterion for end-March 2000) was missed by a large margin, and the performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of external payments arrears was also not observed at the test dates.8 There were also further delays in implementing structural and governance measures, such that two of the seven structural performance criteria (one for end- December 1999, and one for end-March 2000) were not observed. 9. More important, because of the ad hoc nature of the revenue measures and the lack of commitments for key categories of expenditures, the underlying fiscal position was judged by a staff mission to Conakry in May 2000 to be unsustainable. It was thus decided to delay the completion of the first program review and establish a monthly fiscal and monetary ’ These included a one-off payment from the alumina company (amounting to more than 10 percent of first-quarter revenue); advance payments of taxes and dividends by several large public enterprises; and the sale of the government shares in a recently formed cotton company. * See Tables 1 and 2 of the MEFP, Appendix I, Attachment.

Under this interim program, projected year-end revenue was consistent with the original program target, on the basis of an increase in the petroleum tax scheduled for July 2000 and measures to improve tax receipts in the fishing sector (the increased enforcement of fishing licenses and collection of taxes from commercial fishermen in Guinean waters). Expenditure was expected to broadly reach the original target at the end of the year, with priority expenditure in the second half of 2000 brought back to budgeted levels. Additional financing from the banking system was foreseen through end-2000 to make up for postponed donor disbursements. On the structural front, ali measures foreseen in the program were to be implemented as planned by end-September, and additional measures were added for end- August 2000 to advance structural reforms. These included in the area of governance, making operational the anticorruption committee; in public enterprise reform, beginning implementation of the action plan to reform the mining parastatal (ANAIM), and completing the tax audits of four major public enterprises; in the area of public finances, auditing customs and revising the mechanisms for setting domestic petroleum prices; and, in the banking and financial sector, completing the audit of the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea (BCRG). B. Implementation of the Interim Program 11. The implementation of the interim program was largely satisfactory and the program has been brought back on track. The revised targets for end-September 2000 for the primary surplus, reserve money, and net bank credit to the government were observed, and domestic arrears were reduced as planned. Moreover, a considerable effort was made to tighten expenditure management and improve its composition, as well as to strengthen revenue mobilization, and the structural reform program advanced measurably (see Box 1). However, the target for the net foreign assets of the central bank was not met. C. Developments in Output and Prices9 12. Real GDP growth slowed to 3.3 percent in 1999, compared with 4.5 percent in 1998, reflecting the impact on agricultural output of the unstable security situation along Guinea’s borders. Output growth is expected to rebound to 4.5 percent in 2000, despite the deepening adverse effects of the regional conflict on agricultural production, transport and services, primarily on account of a robust expansion of mining activities. Overall investment increased by L percentage point to 22 percent of GDP in 1999, driven primarily by public investment. However, overall consumption also increased slightly, lowering the gross domestic savings rate to 17.7 percent of GDP in 1999 from 18.9 percent in 1998. ’ Guinea’s national accounts data were significantly revised in late 2000, leading to lower current GDP figures and higher constant GDP figures (see Box 2).

Measures to Improve Governance in Guinea Some of the structural reforms implemented under the interim program, in addition to strengthening budgetary performance, also helped to further improve transparency and strengthen governance. On the expenditure front, these included the introduction of the computerized expenditure tracking system (in June), and the adoption of a revised general accounting framework for the public finances (in August 2000). Together with the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), these reforms contribute to closer monitoring of expenditure and its composition. As the MTEF is extended to all budgetary expenditure, the combination of these instruments should also contribute to greater expenditure efficiency. On the revenue side, the authorities launched in mid- 1999 a reform plan for reorganizing customs and by end-September 2000 had completed the tax audits of the utility enterprises and the audit of customs invoices and procedures. The action plans formulated on the basis of the tax audits will correct some of the systemic problems that led to shortfalls in tax collections from these enterprises in the past, particularly as concerns the VAT. The customs audit has allowed the authorities to identify the scope of the abuse of the flat-rate payment system aimed at informal importers. Together with the enhanced monitoring of exemptions and the ongoing reform of the customs, these measures should help to strengthen overall revenue performance. The National Anticorruption Committee has already conducted a preliminary review of some dubious treasury operations and of fishery licenses, identifying some cases of abuse. It will also follow up on the results of the tax and customs audits, and be involved in the ex post verification of the government accounts, leading up to the preparation of a report on budget execution to be submitted to Parliament. Finally, as part of their effort to increase transparency, the authorities have begun in 2000 to hold regular press briefings on budget execution, a process greatly facilitated by the computerized expenditure tracking system. Reflecting the compression of public spending in 2000, the domestic savings rate is projected to rise to 20.1 percent of GDP, while overall investment should remain stable as a percentage of GDP. Average inflation eased to 4.6 percent in 1999 from 5.1 percent in 1998, but prices increased rapidly during the last three months of 1999, owing to a significant increase in retail petroleum prices (15-20 percent) in October 1999 and a strong depreciation of the Guinean franc. Given the further 60 percent increase in retail petroleum prices at end-August 2000 and the continued depreciation of the Guinean franc, the inflation rate had increased to 6.5 percent by September 2000, and it is projected at 7.7 percent for the year as a whole (compared with the original program target of 5.8 percent) (Table 1). D. Public Finances 13. On the fiscal front, the budget deficit and, consequently, government borrowing from the central bank continued to increase through July 2000. However, the situation improved in August as measures under the interim program took effect, and, by end-September 2000, the budgetary situation had improved significantly. The end-September revenue outcome was still some 3 percent below the objective of the interim program, owing to the shortfall of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- Box 2. Guinea: Revision of National Accounts Guinea’s former Ministry of Plan, which now forms part of the Ministry of Finance, revised its national accounts statistics for the years of 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, implementing a new methodology. Compared with the previous data collection, the number of enterprises included in the analysis has increased, with a view to covering the complete range of important private and public companies. During three months, a group of 15 statisticians visited 206 companies to obtain 1997 data and 227 companies for 1998 data. Further, an increased effort has been made to streamline national accounts data with budgetary data, data from international aid flows, data collected at decentralized levels and social security data. This operation is of high importance for the Guinean national statistical system, as national accounts data were often disruptive in the past, with several sources publishing competing versions of data sets that were often not internally coherent. Moreover, these former data suffered from methodological weaknesses and were not in line with budgetary or balance of payments numbers. The new data reveal that nominal GDP was overestimated in the past. On average, the revised numbers for the years of 1995, 1996, I997 and 1998 are three percent lower than the previous figures. Average nominal GDP growth during the same period is one percentage point lower than according to the old data. The base year for calculating GDP in constant prices was changed from 1994 to 1996, leading to revised real GDP figures which are on average seven percent higher than the previous ones. The average real growth rate over the years of 1995 to 1998, however, remains almost the same as before, i.e., 4.8 percent compared to 4.6 percent. These revisions also have implications for the preliminary national accounts data for 1999 and the projections for 2000 and 2001, which are now lower in current prices and higher in constant ones. Even though nominal growth rates have not significantly changed according to the revisions, absolute GDP figures to which they are applied are now lower. Regarding real GDP, growth rates have been corrected downwards for the years 1999,2000, and 200 1. petroleum taxes and weak VAT collections from major public enterprises (Table 4). However, other taxes, particularly import duties, improved markedly, reflecting in part the impact of the customs reform (see Box 3). On the expenditure side, spending in priority sectors and on pensions was brought back in line with the budget. Domestically financed capital expenditures remained compressed, and overall current expenditures were in line with the objectives of the interim program, as other nonidentified expenditures were lower than expected, offsetting the revenue shortfall.” lo Despite undeniable progress in recent years in reconciling the budgetary and the monetary accounts, the treatment of the accounts of autonomous government entities, such as universities, social security, and the Road Fund, in the general government accounts (TOFE) is still incomplete. Because of the large number of these accounts, about 100, it is difficult to monitor and document all their operations in a comprehensive fashion. The discrepancies between monetary and budgetary data are reflected partly in changes in arrears and partly in changes in other “nonidentified” expenditures. The Fund staff continues to work with the authorities on analyzing the impact of these accounts on expenditure and on domestic arrears.

Guinea: Implementation of Customs Reform The customs reform plan initiated in mid- 1999, based on recommendations of an IMF technical assistance mission in early 1999, includes three major components: (a) a redefinition of the role of the preshipment inspection company, the SociCte Gin&ale de Surveillance (SGS); (b) a reduction of exemptions and measures to fight fraud and smuggling; and (c) a program to modemize the customs directorate and its procedures: . A new contract has been signed with the SGS for the period 2000-01. It clearly spells out the conditions of cooperation between the SGS and the customs directorate, including a better monitoring of the activities of the SGS by the customs directorate. The SGS has completed the installation of a data base for import values at the customs directorate. l The exemptions on petroleum taxes have been limited through the creation of quotas for enterprises benefiting from these exemptions. In addition, the exemptions under the Mining and Investment Codes are being reviewed. Measures have been taken to improve the control over imported goods in customs areas at the airport. To limit fraud, the procedure for clearing customs has been streamlined to ensure that duties are paid before customs clearance is granted. l A computerized personnel data management system has been installed and is operational. Streamlining of the customs directorate has started with the dismissal of contractual customs agents. A compulsory system of staff rotation has been introduced, under which managers have to be reassigned every five years, and a code of conduct for customs agents has been issued and widely circulated. A computerized accounting unit has been created within the customs directorate, and the internal inspection of customs has been reinforced at the regional level. Finally, “quotas” for revenue collections have been established for each tax collection unit. 14. Thus, despite higher military spending, the revised target for the primary surplus at end-September (GF 128 billion, or 2.4 percent of GDP) was met. The reduction in domestic arrears at end-September 2000 amounted to 0.7 percent of GDP, roughly in line with the interim program’s target. In addition to the repayments in the first quarter of unpaid expenditure commitments carried over from 1999, there was a significant additional reduction in the stock of outstanding domestic arrears during the first nine months of the year. External debt-service payments through end-September were 0.1 percent of GDP higher than expected, owing to the depreciation of the Guinean franc. As the shortfall in external budgetary support over the same period also amounted to 0.1 percent of GDP, the adjusted target for net bank credit to the government was met.*’ E. Money and Credit 15. The fiscal tightening enabled the authorities to meet the revised end-September targets for reserve money and net credit to the government. Broad money expanded by 8.8 percent over the course of 1999, and by a further 18 percent through end-September 2000, driven primarily by an increase in net credit to the government-which nonetheless ” Domestic debt repayments were some 0.2 percent of GDP lower than expected, as some payments were made only in the first days of October. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- remained within the programmed limit-as well as by a more moderate rise in credit to the nongovernment sector (see Table 6). 16. However, as indicated above, the revised target for end-September 2000 on the net foreign assets of the central bank was missed, although the foreign exchange auction system, established in late 1999, has operated in a satisfactory manner. After a depreciation of 33 percent in 1999 following the introduction of the auction, the Guinean franc appreciated by 5 percent in the first quarter of 2000, reflecting the BCRG’s periodic interventions to prop up the currency and inflows of project aid. However, by mid-2000, the currency again began to depreciate, as the central bank ceased to intervene. The spread between the official and parallel exchange rates has fluctuated at around 1 percent during 2000.” The present exchange arrangement represents a considerable improvement over the Box 4. Guinea: The Functioning of the Foreign Exchange Bureaus The informal market for foreign currency has existed for a long time in Guinea, even though informal currency trading was prohibited by law before 1995. In order to integrate the growing informal market into the formal one, the central bank developed new regulations to create incentives to formalize foreign exchange activities. In this context, in 1997 “official” bureaus were authorized through a licensing agreement from the central bank, which required of the bureaus the posting of a bond, physical premises, and an accounting framework. The licensed bureaus were allowed to participate in the foreign exchange market for the first time in December 1999, but their participation was suspended in the first quarter of 2000 because their activities were not sufficiently transparent. Licensed foreign exchange bureaus are organized in a formal association that promotes self-discipline among its members by monitoring their transactions and sanctioning those members who fail to respect their obligations. The use of cellular phones to exchange information makes for an efficient market and the easy adjustment of the exchange rate in Conakry to market-clearing levels. The high degree of organization also enables any operator to buy or to borrow foreign currencies or Guinean tiancs from colleagues to meet transaction requirements. The bureaus have been increasingly involved in the foreign exchange transactions of the informal mining sector (gold and diamond exporters), due to efficiency and confidentiality concerns. With an estimated 70 percent of foreign exchange activity in Guinea channeled through the informal market and foreign exchange bureaus, the integration of the bureaus into the official foreign exchange market should contribute to alleviating supply constraints on the official market, and enhancing its overall efficiency. ‘* Since the beginning of 2000, the spread has remained within the 2 percent range, with two exceptions-an upward spike in mid-April, and a downward spike in early September. The first was largely due to central bank intervention. The second may have reflected the effects on the official supply of foreign exchange of the uncertainty caused by the border attacks that began in late August.

Nonetheless, owing to the absence of a formal mechanism to ensure that the spread between the two rates never exceeds 2 percent, this arrangement constitutes a multiple currency practice subject to IMF jurisdiction under Article VIII. Since the authorities have not yet set a clear timetable for the introduction of such a formal mechanism, the staff does not recommend the approval of the multiple currency practice.13 F. Developments in the External Sector 17. The current account deficit, excluding official transfers, widened from the equivalent of 6.1 percent of GDP in 1998 to 6.8 percent in 1999 (from 2.3 percent to 3.7 percent, including official transfers), primarily on account of the sharp deterioration of the merchandise trade balance resulting from the decline in receipts from Guinea’s principal mining exports (Table 7). The trade balance is projected to improve substantially in 2000, as receipts from mining exports have strengthened while imports have stagnated, thus narrowing the current account deficit to 5.9 percent of GDP (2.7 percent, including official transfers). 18. The capital account surplus fell further in 1999, as donor budget support and private capital inflows fell off sharply. It is expected to decline marginally in 2000, despite a recovery in private capital inflows relative to their extremely low level in 1999. Given the projected improvement in the current account in 2000, however, the overall deficit is projected to narrow by half, to US$46 million. The deficit could be covered by the drawdown of reserves and the accumulation of external payments arrears, including to the Paris Club, thus breaching the relevant performance criterion at end-March 2000. 19. Notwithstanding the virtual absence of budgetary donor assistance during 1999-2000, Guinea continued to make debt-service payments to Paris Club creditors on the basis of the terms and conditions of the 1997 rescheduling arrangement, and to multilateral creditors. As such, Guinea has thus technically accumulated reschedulable arrears to Paris Club creditors (US$l9.7 million).‘4 In addition, Guinea continued to accumuiate payments arrears to Russia, as well as to a number of non-Paris Club bilateral creditors (including China, Egypt, and Morocco).” Negotiations are under way with these bilateral creditors on the treatment of I3 This issue will be taken up during the next staff mission with a view to eliminating the multiple currency practice. l4 Details on the composition of the stock of the external public debt outstanding at end- 1999, and its value in net present value terms, are presented in the decision point document under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative) (EBS/00/243 and IDA/SecM2000-6723, November 29,200O). ” The total stock of arrears at end-September 2000 was UW82.6 million, of which US$420 million was owed to Russia.

After long discussion, agreement in principle was reached in April 2000 on the modalities of treatment of the Russian debt, including the interest and exchange rates to be used in the calculations, and, in November 2000, the Guinean authorities made an initial cash payment of US$l million in the context of this agreement. 20. As indicated above (paragraph 12), prices increased rapidly in the last three months of 1999. As a result, the real effective exchange rate depreciated by 14 percent in 1999. It strengthened somewhat in the first quarter of 2000, as the nominal value of the Guinean franc rose by 5 percent, but declined again after July 2000 with the renewed nominal depreciation of the currency (Figure 3). G. Structural Reforms 21. After delays in early 2000, considerable progress was made in implementing structural reforms in the second half of 2000, especially with regard to public finances and the public enterprise sector.16 This progress facilitated the strengthening of the fiscal position at end-September 2000. Moreover, the central bank has already started to implement the recommendations of the audit of its operations completed at end-August 2000, and to move toward the use of more flexible tools for liquidity management, in line with the recommendations of the May 2000 MAE technical assistance mission.17 22. The restructuring of the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) has begun, with the adoption of an action plan, based on the recommendations of a technical assistance mission from an international consulting firm. The new management has begun to implement the plan, with positive initial results, including the reduction of the arrears on pension payments to the equivalent of about 6 months on average by end-September 2000, compared with arrears of 18-24 months two years ago. Finally, the National Anticorruption Committee (CNLC), which was created in February 2000, began operations in June; it has already completed a preliminary examination of dubious practices in the management of fishing licenses and at the treasury, and is expected to submit a definitive plan for its future activities in early January 2001. As a result of these measures, all of the structural performance criteria and benchmarks of the original program have now been met (Appendix I, Attachment, Table 2). l6 Details of the structural measures implemented by end-September under the interim program are presented in paragraphs 7-9 of the MEFP (Appendix I, Attachment).

POLICY DISCUSSIONSANDOUTLOOKFORTHEREMAINDER OFTHEPROGRAMAND F0~2001 A. Economic Environment Through end-March 2001 23. The policy discussions focused on dealing with the consequences of the absence of additional foreign financing before end-2000 in the context of a relatively weak external environment. The expenditure pressures in the last quarter of 2000, including for national defense and other noncompressible outlays, such as wages and debt service, create the need for additional domestic bank financing for the budget deficit (see below), notwithstanding the possible adverse effect on domestic prices and the exchange rate that this measure may have.18 24. Moreover, the economic environment is further complicated by the conflict at Guinea’s borders, and the uncertainty of its effects on military spending and economic activity. The interruption of the UN activities in support of the refugees on Guinean territory has led to increasing pressures on the indigenous population in the affected areas, to which the government also has to respond. Finally, the delay in the parliamentary election has complicated the political situation at a time when concerted national action is necessary, inter alia, to complete the full poverty reduction strategy paper. 25. All in all, the Guinean authorities have responded well to the difficult environment, acting decisively to counter program slippages, albeit after a poor start in early 2000. The mission took note of the key measures that had been taken over the last six months. Revenue mobilization and, particularly, expenditure management had been strengthened; the expansion of domestic credit had been held within the limits set under the interim program; and delays in implementing key structural measures had been overcome. There were also clear signs of progress toward rationalizing the operations of the central bank and the conduct of monetary policy in general. Nonetheless, a much more consistent approach will be necessary to maintain the momentum of reform and reestablish the credibility of Guinea’s government. This would be particularly important in the present context, where Guinea is seeking substantial additional resources from debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative to carry out its poverty reduction strategy. 26. The authorities conceded that program implementation had not been sufficiently consistent. In the first two months of 2000, they had focused too narrowly on respecting the narrowly defined quantitative performance criteria, without due regard to the quality of the fiscal adjustment or the importance of the structural measures that had been put off, However, they noted that the awareness in the government and the administration of the importance of a sustained overall effort was now much deeper. In addition, the more open I8 This domestic bridge financing would be repaid using resources from external financing expected to be disbursed at the end of the first quarter of 2001; the period of additional monetary expansion would thereby be limited to roughly four-five months.

B. Fiscal Policy 27. The fiscal situation will remain difficult during the last quarter of 2000. Government revenue at year’s end is expected to reach about 11 ‘/z percent of GDP. Current expenditure is projected to be slightly above the level programmed in May 2000, as military spending is expected to rise to about 1 percent of GDP, or 10 percent of current expenditure. In addition, as a result of an agreement reached with trade unions in the context of the petroleum price hike at end-August 2000, the authorities have granted a limited wage increase (raising the wage bill 1.7 percent over the level projected in the interim program for 2000).” The primary surplus is projected to reach 2.9 percent of GDP (slightly lower than the revised program level), as domestically financed investment and nonpriority current outlays will remain compressed. Because of the shortfall in external financing expected during the last quarter of 2000, net domestic bank credit will increase by GF 45.5 billion over the last quarter (to GF 237.1 billion by end-December), which is roughly the amount of foreign budgetary assistance originally anticipated under the program.*’ The authorities intend to allow the stock of domestic arrears to rise a little toward the end of the year, and to ask Paris Club donors and lenders to defer the debt-service payments due in December by 30 to 60 days as a means of reducing the need for domestic bank financing. 28. With regard to revenue, the authorities were confident that they could reach the year-end revenue target of GF 623 billion by continuing their policy of a tight implementation of controls at customs, particularly of exemptions, and of strict execution of the action plans based on the tax audits of four public enterprises and of customs invoices.” They recognized, however, the potential risk to petroleum tax receipts that would result from further rises in import prices, given that retail prices remain administratively fixed (see below).22 I9 Part of the wage increase in 2000 reflected promotions granted to military personnel, the recruitment of additional teachers, a number of unexpected promotions in the civil service amounting to GF 1.3 billion in the last quarter. The full-year effect is estimated at GF 5.1 billion (0.1 percent of 2000 GDP). 2o The authorities will attempt to place treasury bills with private enterprises, in order to reduce the requirement of additional bank financing. *’ See paragraph 2 1 of the MEFP (Appendix I, Attachment). 22 Petroleum tax revenue is expected to reach GF 46 billion by end-2000, a shortfall of GF 24 billion relative to the program, owing to the losses experienced until September.

The authorities stressed their commitment to maintaining priority social expenditure and enhancing its efficiency, despite rising national defense requirements and the substantial noncompressible outlays falling due in the fourth quarter. Priority expenditure would still be considerably higher at the end of 2000 than military expenditure, which would exceed the programmed level by 0.6 percent of GDP.23 30. The staff also discussed in detail the draft budget for 2001, which was approved by the government on December 5,200O (a prior action for management approval of the letter of intent) and will be presented to parliament in early December 2000.24 Even under relatively optimistic revenue projections, resources are expected to be limited in 2001: there will be no external financing until the end of the first quarter of the year; and the additional debt relief from Paris Club creditors under the enhanced HIPC Initiative would only be available after approval of a new Fund-supported medium-term program, also expected toward the end of the first quarter. The authorities have therefore prepared a “baseline” budget based on conservative financing assumptions, that is, excluding the additional HIPC Initiative-related debt relief, which will be executed during the first quarter on the basis of a monthly cash-flow plan prepared in consultation with the IMF staff. The “full” budget for 2001 to be submitted for parliamentary approval will integrate the additional priority and poverty-related expenditure that is to be financed by resources from debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative (Table 5). This additional expenditure will be committed only when the additional resources have been made available. 31. Under the baseline budget, overall revenue is projected to increase to 13 percent of GDP in 2001 from 11.6 percent in 2000 on the basis of continued progress in strengthening tax and customs administration, as well as a number of new tax measures. A significant increase in nontax revenue is also projected.25 The planned introduction of the petroleum price adjustment mechanism by end-March 2001 is expected to shelter petroleum tax revenue from the effect of further fluctuations in world oil prices, and steps will be taken to reduce the incidence of exemptions. 32. On the expenditure side, the share of current expenditure in the priority sectors will remain stable, while outlays for the ECOMOG are budgeted to decline from GF 53 billion in 2000 to GF 45 billion, assuming that the regional security situation stabilizes in 2001 .The ‘3 Including wages and expenditures on goods and services, overall military expenditures are projected at GF 80 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) at end-2000. By comparison, social priority expenditures are projected to reach GF 179 billion (3.3 percent of GDP). 24 The revenue and expenditure projections, as well as the assumptions and measures underlying them, are presented in the MEFP (Appendix I, Attachment). 25 Including from the integration of the receipts of the mining parastatal (ANAIM) into the budget, a significant increase in the UN contribution for the support of the Guinean troops serving under the ECOMOG, and the introduction of a national lottery. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2o- wage bill would increase by 7.7 percent, broadly in line with the projected increase of the consumer price index (CH). Provisions are also made for the cost of public enterprise restructuring. The emphasis in capital spending is on projects in the social sectors. Total expenditure under the baseline budget is projected to remain stable at I? percent of GDP in 200 1, the same level as envisaged in the original program. The primary surplus would thus rise to 3.7 percent of GDP (from a projected 2.9 percent in 2000). Allowing for a modest reduction in domestic arrears, the overall budget deficit (on a commitment basis and excluding grants) would decline to 4 percent of GDP in 2001, from 5.3 percent GDP in 2000. C. Money and Credit 33. Discussions on monetary policy focused on dealing with the impact of the monetary expansion at the end of 2000, as well as on the authorities’ plans for reforming monetary policy management and restructuring the banking sector, drawing on the recommendations of the three technical assistance missions from the Fund and the World Bank between June and August 2000. Additional financing of the budget deficit will raise net credit to the government for the year as a whole by 19.3 percent (in percent of beginning-of-period broad money) by end-2000. Thus, broad money will increase by 20.9 percent in 2000, while net foreign assets will contract by 3.1 percent. 34. The authorities were in broad agreement with most of the recommendations of the Fund technical assistance missions concerning the conduct of monetary policy. Some of these will be implemented immediately.26 For example, the central bank has decided to introduce very short term central bank bills as an additional instrument of liquidity management, beginning in November 2000, and to reduce immediately the required reserve ratio (see below). A revised regulatory framework for the foreign exchange bureaus will be implemented by the end of the year, as will the harmonization of the bank licensing agreements and a relaxation of the rules governing the management of foreign currency accounts. Other measures-such as those aimed at reviving the interbank market, improving and harmonizing the BCRG’s refinancing activities, and rationalizing the structure of interest rates (see Appendix VI)-have been agreed to in principle. With regard to the revitalization of the interbank market, a joint commission of the central bank and the commercial banks has been established to define the regulatory framework governing a system of collateral that can be used easily in interbank transactions, and would replace the present central bank guarantee.*’ The central bank is presently evaluating internal proposals on the rationalization of the interest rate structure and, in particular, the adoption of a policy-related reference rate 26 Details are presented in the MEFP, paragraphs 15-l 8 (Appendix I, Attachment). 27 Interbank transactions declined substantially in 1999 and have ceased entirely since March 2000. This reflects in part the reluctance of the larger, more liquid banks to provide support to the smaller banks, as well as the generally tight liquidity situation in the banking system Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-21- of the BCRG that is not automatically indexed to the market rate.28 These measures will be implemented more gradually during the first half of 2001 as the exceptional level of net credit to the government is reduced. 35. Net central bank financing of the government is presently well above the statutory ceiling.29 The staff therefore recommended, and the authorities agreed, not to increase central bank financing of the government any fLrther from its peak in mid-November 2000, and to reduce outstanding net credit from the central bank to the statutory ceiling during 2001. Any additional financing of the budget deficit required by end-2000 will be covered by credit from the commercial banks. 36. The authorities will thus issue new treasury bills to finance a part of the budget deficit at the end of 2000. It is expected that much of this issue will be absorbed by the commercial banks, using resources released by the reduction announced by the central bank in November of the reserve ratio (from 11 percent to 5.5 percent, with effect from December 1,2000), which is expected to release some GF 16 billion in additional liquidity. These new treasury bills will be remunerated at a rate that is positive in real terms and sufficiently higher than the rate on previously issued bills to facilitate their purchase.30 37. Guinea’s banking system consists of seven banks. The three largest banks control 80 percent of deposits and loans, and are generally profitable and well managed. The four smaller banks are less capitalized and less profitable-they have thus far been unable to attract sufficient deposits to develop their activities, and thus have relatively little impact on the overall market. At end-March 2000, only three of the seven commercial banks were in compliance with four or more of the six prudential ratios. Two of the smaller banks have operated under restructuring plans since 1998, but their situation remains fragile, and they are still not in compliance with the solvency and own-capital ratios (Appendix VI, Table 1).31 The foreign partner has not yet contributed to the required recapitalization of one of these two banks. For the other, the BCRG has requested an external examination of various options 28 The Fund staff had urged in this context that the central bank’s refinancing rate be set sufficiently above the treasury bills auction rate to encourage the banks to lend among themselves before having recourse to the central bank. 29 The statutory ceiling on net central bank lending to the government requires that the ratio of the net current account position of the treasury at the central bank to the previous year’s budgetary revenue not exceed 20 percent. At end-1999, this ratio was 33 percent, and had risen to 5 1 percent at end-October 2000. 3o Under these assumptions, the net current account position of the treasury at the central bank at year’s end could decline to the equivalent of 48 percent of the previous year’s revenue. 3’ Given their small market share, however, it is not expected that their difficulties would call into question the stability of the entire banking system.

Monetary policy in 200 1 will continue to be directed at lowering the rate of inflation. The authorities recognized the need for a more active and efficient management of liquidity in the banking system, including through the use of central bank and treasury bills, as well as a more flexible interest rate policy. This would assume particular importance when the newly issued treasury bills reach maturity, and some of the bills may have to be rolled over as part of a sterilization operation. The stance of monetary policy will be reviewed in detail at the time of the discussions on a new PRGF-supported program. 39. Throughout most of the first quarter of 2001, as indicated above, net bank credit to the government will remain at an exceptionally high level, but it would decline significantly at end-March as disbursements of donor program assistance resume. For 2001 as a whole, the government’s net indebtedness to the banking system is projected to decline by GF 104 billion (some 18 percent of beginning-of-period money stock and 1.8 percent of GDP). The resulting contraction of net domestic assets (15 percent of beginning-of-period money) will be reflected in an accumulation of net foreign assets of the banking system (20 percent in terms of beginning-of-period broad money). Broad money is projected to expand by 5 percent from an exceptionally high base at end-2000. D. Structural Reforms 40. The mission noted the decisive actions taken to reestablish the momentum of structural reform under the interim program.33 The recently adopted overall strategy for the public enterprise sector had set the stage for accelerating the privatization and restructuring program, which would be an important signal of the government’s intention to redefine its role. The mission stressed the importance of tinalizing the energy sector framework and ensuring that privatized enterprises would be subject to the general provisions of the Mining Code or the Investment Code. The authorities shared this view, and stressed their intention to reduce exemptions by not renewing expiring special conventions and renegotiating the terms of those still in effect. 31 32 The draft 2001 budget has an allocation for the potential costs of bank restructuring. 33 See MEFP, paragraphs 19-22 (Appendix I, Attachment). ” The government also intends to conduct a comparative study of mining codes in member countries of the ECOWAS, with a view to aligning the Guinean code to best practices in the region.

The draft 2001 budget provides for the transfer of most of the proceeds from two taxes to the local governments to enable them to play a more effective role in delivering services in the context of the poverty reduction strategy. The monitoring of expenditure would be extended to these local levels. The mission stressed the importance in this context of ensuring that fiscal discipline be observed at all levels of government. 42. The mission also noted the progress made in the area of governance and accountability. Of particular importance were the measures to strengthen public finance management, and the completion of the audits of key public enterprises and of customs invoices.35 In addition, the work of the independent CNLC was of signal importance. The authorities stressed their commitment to the full implementation of the recommendations of the audits and to extend the expenditure tracking system and the medium-term expenditure framework. They also underscored the importance of supporting the work of the CNLC through close collaboration with government oversight agencies. 43. While accepting the government’s position that the two-month delay in adjusting retail petroleum prices was necessary to prepare the measure properly, the mission urged the authorities to introduce immediately the full flexibility of retail prices, while awaiting the conclusions of the study on the petroleum pricing structure and the implementation of an automatic price adjustment mechanism. The authorities were unwilling to do so at the present time, however, preferring to undertake a fundamental reform of the entire system on the basis of the consultant’s report. Given the strategic importance of imported petroleum products in the Guinean economy, this reform would have to be carefUlly introduced; nonetheless, it would be completed by end-March 200 I. E. Outlook for 2001 44. Output growth in 2001 is projected at 4.5 percent, down from the original projection of 5.5 percent, reflecting the continuing adverse effect of the border attacks on agricultural production, as well as slower expansion in the mining sector following the robust growth of 2000. Assuming a gradual stabilization of the exchange rate and of key import prices, such as petroleum, average inflation is projected to rise to 9.5 percent in 2001, but to decline on a 12-month basis rate to 4.7 percent by end-December 2001. 45. Notwithstanding the improvement in mining export receipts, the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is expected to widen from 5.9 percent of GDP in 2000 to 6.5 percent in 200 1, as imports recover from the stagnation of the past two years and net private transfers decline. The capital account surplus (excluding program assistance) is projected to narrow considerably relative to 1999-2000, owing to lower-than- anticipated project aid. The overall balance should thus worsen. Furthermore, a small strengthening of 35 See Box 1 above, and paragraphs 7-8 of the MEFP (Appendix I, Attachment). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - the foreign reserve position, from the equivalent of 2.3 to 2.6 months of imports, is projected, resulting in a residual financing gap of US$125.7 million. This gap could be entirely covered by resources from the Fund under a new arrangement, identified program financing from the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Union, and bilateral donors, and rescheduling from Paris Club creditors on Naples flow terms. 46. The external debt service due is projected to be higher in 2001, reflecting primarily the agreement reached on the service of the debt to Russia. The authorities expect to reach the decision point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in December 2000, and to benefit from the interim debt relief under the Initiative, estimated to amount to US$106.6 million during 200 I-02, of which US$9.6 million in rescheduling under Cologne terms From the Paris Club, and US$97 million from multilateral institutions.36 47. The staff and the authorities concurred on the priorities for fkture structural reforms. These include a fundamental reform of the civil service, aimed at moving to a performance- based remuneration and advancement system; a thorough revamping of the social security system; the acceleration of public enterprise privatization and restructuring; and the gradual elimination of customs exemptions. The authorities noted that the civil service statutes had already been revised, in consultation with the unions, in preparation for the shift in the remuneration and advancement system, but conceded that a comprehensive human resource management strategy still had to be devised. This would be particularly important to ensure that the administrative decentralization achieved its objectives. They also intend to launch an actuarial study of the social security system prior to engaging in a full-fledged reform program. 48. The mission also discussed in detail with the authorities the implications of the introduction of a second monetary zone among ECOWAS members, planned for 2003. The authorities observed that most of the non-CFA franc member counties of the ECOWAS would have difficulty in meeting the primary convergence criteria established for the zone (on inflation, the budget deficit, central bank financing of the budget deficit, and gross reserves), but stressed the commitment expressed at the highest levels of government to the project. They noted, however, that the steps toward compliance with the convergence criteria would have to be consistent with the national poverty reduction strategy, which would guide all government policy. They also expected certain benefits from the expected move to harmonize the trade and tax systems for Guinea’s production and trade within the subregion. There have been no major changes in the trading system since the last Article IV consultation. 36 To the extent that interim debt relief is accorded under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, the amount of the rescheduling, and thus the accumulation of reserves, would be correspondingly higher. Details of the interim assistance expected under the Initiative are presented in the decision point document under the enhanced HIPC Initiative (EBS/00/243 and IDA/SECR2000-672), November 29,200O. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - F. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Prospects3’ 49. The preliminary medium-term macroeconomic framework prepared by staff indicate output growth of over 5 percent in 2002-03, based largely on the strength of activity in the agricultural and mining sectors where Guinea has a strong comparative advantage. Inflation would stabilize at under 4 percent, and the external current account deficit, excluding official transfers, would narrow from 6.5 percent of GDP in 2001 to about 6 percent by 2003. The ratio of investment to GDP is projected at about 22% percent for the period 2002-03, while domestic savings should reach about 20% percent of GDP. 50. In the area of fiscal policy, government revenue (excluding grants) is projected to rise from 11.6 percent of GDP in 2000 to just over 13 percent in 2003, based on a continuation of the policy to reduce tax exemptions, notably in the mining sector, progress in mobilizing customs revenue, and the liberalization of petroleum prices. Under a baseline scenario (that is, excluding additional poverty-related expenditure financed by debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative), current expenditure would be reduced to less than 8.8 percent of GDP in 2003 from 9.9 percent in 2001, and the primary surplus would increase from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2000 to 4.8 percent in 2003. 51. Monetary policy will continue to aim at a low level of inflation, improving liquidity management, and strengthening the banking system, so as to facilitate the provision of adequate finance for economic activity (see Section III C). The strengthening of the instruments of monetary policy is part of an action plan to implement the key recommendations of recent technical assistance missions from the Fund and the World Bank. The authorities will continue to implement a flexible exchange rate policy. IV. THE POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY AND THE ENHANCED HIPC INITIATIVE 52. The authorities have prepared, in close consultation with civil society and the donor community, an interim poverty reduction strategy paper (I-PRSP), which sets out the process and timetable for the completion of the final Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper by end- 200 1 .38 In the context of these preparations, and in close consultation with the staffs of the Fund and the World Bank, the authorities have defined a series of quantified intermediate outcome indicators, as well as triggers for the HIPC Initiative completion point in the priority areas of health and education, the strengthening of governance, and the maintenance of 37 A complete medium-term macroeconomic framework will be prepared in the context of the discussions of a new three-year PRGF arrangement, envisaged for early 2001. 38 For details of the outlined strategy and timeline, see the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and Joint StafAssessment (EBD/00/103 and /EBD/00/104 and IDA/SecM2000-672). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - macroeconomic stability. The indicators are drawn from existing sectoral strategies, and the costing of their implementation has been completed. In preparing the budget for 2001, the authorities have determined the additional spending in the priority areas to be financed by additional resources from the interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative (see above).39 53. The decision point document for Guinea under the enhanced HJPC Initiative presents the indicators for the completion point and explains the justification for their choice; in addition, it provides a detailed description of the steps taken to enhance the efficiency and ensure a transparent monitoring of the use of the additional resources from debt relief. V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 54. The Guinean authorities have successfully implemented the interim program established last May to bring the program back on track by end-September, and have taken measures to ensure that the slippages in late 1999/early 2000 are not repeated. However, the outlook for the rest of the year and for the first quarter of 2001 remains difficult. Guinea will complete its second successive year virtually without external budgetary assistance in 2000, resulting in a sizable net transfer of resources abroad, while facing a rising security threat on its borders. The combination of these factors severely complicates the cash-flow situation through the end of March 2001, when substantial foreign assistance is expected to become available. The absence of external financing debt-service payments and the higher military spending, a significant part of which is in foreign exchange, will further strain the official foreign exchange market and exert continuing pressure on the exchange rate. Moreover, the need to finance the budget deficit through additional domestic bank borrowing will require great vigilance to ensure that inflationary pressures are kept in check. 55. Guinea must now demonstrate that it can consistently sustain its adjustment effort. This will require a marked break with the past track record of repeated policy slippages. A considerable improvement has been made in the management of public finances. It is now essential to continue the ongoing efforts to strengthen revenue mobilization, which remains well below Guinea’s potential. Of particular significance in this context will be the action plans to rectify weaknesses in the taxation of key public enterprises and in customs, the reduction in the number of abuses of the system of flat-rate taxation of the informal sector, and the gradual elimination of the pervasive impart duty and other tax exemptions. 56. On the structural front, the completion of a new framework for investment in the public utilities sector and the adoption of the public enterprise reform strategy augur well for the privatization and restructuring program. Given the good progress achieved in 2000, the 39 The priority sectors are those to which the medium-term expenditure framework is presently applied, and the levels of expenditure have been discussed in detail with the World Bank. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - authorities should now move quickly, so as to maintain the momentum of the last few months. Similarly, although the new management has managed to halt the deterioration of the social security fund, a fundamental reform of the system is clearly necessary, and the required studies should be launched immediately. 57. In the area of banking and financial sector reform, the authorities have moved with determination to implement the recommendations of the central bank audit and to improve the management of monetary policy, as well as to integrate the foreign exchange bureaus into the official market. The latter reform should contribute to increasing the supply of foreign exchange in the official market and help stabilize the exchange rate. Given the importance of microfinance in supporting rural and small-scale enterprise activity, the staff encourages the central bank to complete the new regulatory framework for these institutions as soon as possible. Although the general health of the banking system has improved, it is now necessary to decide on the approach to be taken in dealing with one of the banks presently under restructuring. 58. Significant progress has also been made in several areas toward strengthening accountability and improving governance, but there is still considerable scope for improvement. The population and the donor community place great expectations in the work of the National Anticorruption Committee. The authorities must be scrupulous in implementing the recommendations of the committee, while making concerted efforts to strengthen the judiciary and ensure its independence. 59. The staff regrets that a flexible system for the automatic adjustment of petroleum prices has not yet been put in place, particularly as the need for further discretionary adjustments cannot be excluded, given current conditions in world oil markets. The authorities should proceed apace with the study and with the revision of the petroleum pricing structure, and should ensure that the adjustment mechanism is put in place as soon as possible. 60. The authorities have made a good start toward completing the national poverty reduction strategy with the preparation of an interim poverty reduction strategy paper of good quality. They are to be commended for involving various civil society groups in the process, and must now ensure that this participation is deepened and expanded to other relevant areas of government policy formulation. The authorities have also clearly identified the planned use of the resources from the likely debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. The staff welcomes their intention to involve parliament and civil society in the monitoring of additional spending financed by these resources, and in the overall implementation of the poverty reduction policies. 61. The macroeconomic framework will need to be adjusted to reflect the priorities of the poverty reduction strategy, while maintaining the emphasis on growth and macroeconomic stability. Greater and more active involvement of the business community and of civil society in the discussions on macroeconomic policy is needed to ensure that the constraints Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - are fully understood, and that a broad consensus can be generated for necessary policies, so as to ensure their sustained implementation. 62. The Guinean authorities face certain risks in the continued implementation of the economic adjustment program. Some of these are exogenous-such as the possibility of further terms of trade shocks, or of a major deterioration in the security situation. Other possible pitfalls can be reduced by taking determined policy action to overcome the resistance of vested interest to necessary change, address the underlying causes of past policy slippages, and strengthen governance. Similarly, emphasis has been placed on administrative decentralization as a means of enhancing service delivery and overall efficiency, particularly in the context of the poverty reduction strategy-great care should now be taken to ensure that the decentralization process is properly executed. 63. The Guinean authorities have demonstrated over the last six months their awareness of the difficult situation facing the country, and their determination to improve the management of economic policy. It is now essential that they also demonstrate more convincingly the ability to implement appropriate policies in an sustained and consistent manner, so as to avoid the slippages that have adversely affected economic programs in the past. In this context, the staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers for the nonobservance of two quantitative performance criteria (at end-March 2000) and two structural performance criteria (one at end-December 1999, and one at end-March 2000), and recommends the conclusion of the first review under the third annual PRGF arrangement.

The Guinean government requests through this letter waivers for the nonobservance of two quantitative performance criteria, the target for net foreign assets of the central bank for end-March 2000, and the zero ceiling on outstanding external payments arrears, and for the nonobservance of two structural performance criteria for end-December 1999 (i.e., the establishment of an anticorruption committee) and for end-March 2000 (on the elaboration of an action plan for reform of the mining parastatal ANAIM). These two latter measures have been implemented with some delay. The government is determined to continue to execute its economic and financial structural adjustment program, as it is described in its memorandum of December 7, 1999. This execution for the rest of the program period will take place along the lines agreed with the Fund, and the government will make all efforts to achieve the objectives it has adopted. The government will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requests in connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and achieving the objectives of the program described in the attached memorandum. The government believes that the policies and measures set out in the attached memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of its program, and it will take any f%rther measures that will become appropriate for this purpose.

INTRODUCTION 1. Implementation of the program supported by the third annual arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) during the period October 1, 1999-March 3 1, 2000 was seriously complicated by unfavorable exogenous developments, such as the deterioration of the terms of trade resulting from the sharp increase in international oil prices since December 1999; the absence of external financial aid; and the worsening security situation at the country’s borders, which led to substantial unprogrammed military outlays. 2. In light of this situation, the Guinean government took steps during the first quarter of 2000 to reduce public expenditure and strengthen domestic revenue mobilization. By reducing expenditure, it was possible to attain the program objectives for net bank credit and base money at end-March 2000; however, the budget situation at end-March proved difficult to sustain because of the very low level of expenditure commitments in the priority sectors and for consumption of key public services, as well as the persistent weakness in revenue mobilization, despite the ad hoc measures that had been taken. Further, the central bank’s net foreign assets fell short of the programmed level, primarily as a result of the absence of external aid and the need to finance unavoidable military expenditure and external debt service payments in foreign exchange. There were also substantial delays in implementing the structural reform program, and new external payments arrears were accumulated. As a result, two of the six quantitative performance criteria and two of the quantitative benchmarks for end-March 2000, as well as two of the seven structural performance criteria (for end-December 1999 and end-March 2000), were not observed (Tables 1 and 2). 3. In consultation with the May 2000 mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Guinean government decided to defer the conclusion of the first review under the third annual PRGF arrangement, and established monthly budget and monetary targets to correct the shortfalls observed and ensure that the initial revenue and expenditure targets would be met by the end of the year. Domestic revenues were to be increased, inter alia, by adjusting retail prices for petroleum products to reflect the increase in oil prices on the international market; expenditure execution in the priority sectors was to be accelerated, so as to reach the initially budgeted level; and domestic bank financing during the second half of the year was revised upward to reflect the delays in mobilizing external aid. Additional structural measures were also planned in the areas of governance (start-up of the anticorruption committee); public enterprise reform (implementation of an action plan for reform of the National Agency for the Development of Mining Infrastructure (ANAIM) and completion of the tax audit of four major public enterprises); government finances (audit of customs Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 47 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT operations, implementation of the computerized system for the expenditure process, and revision of the adjustment mechanism for prices of petroleum products); and the banking sector (completion of the audit of the central bank). This memorandum describes the progress made in implementing the revised program for 2000 and the financial policy orientations to the end of the current program period, as well as the main thrust of the budget for 2001. It also takes stock of the process of drafting the interim poverty reduction strategy paper, and preparations for reaching the decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. u. RESULTS AT END-SEPTEMBER 2000 4. Implementation of the monthly program for the period June-September 2000 was generally satisfactory, despite the further deterioration of the country’s security situation during the summer. These developments led to a larger-than-projected increase in military expenditure to protect Guinea’s borders against incursions of armed rebel troops from neighboring countries, although the government did not benefit from any financial aid from external partners. 5. In the fiscal area, revenue was lower than projected at end-September, primarily as a result of a shortfall in petroleum tax revenues- the authorities raised petroleum prices by 60 percent at end-August, i.e., almost two months later than projected. The government used this period to conduct a public awareness campaign on the need for the price increase. Collection of the value-added tax (VAT) from certain major public enterprises and of nontax revenue also fell somewhat short of expectations. By contrast, delays in commitments for priority expenditure, pensions, and water and electricity consumption were fully made up by end-September; domestic arrears were lower than programmed; and external debt service was paid consistent with the terms of the 1997 Paris Club rescheduling agreement, notwith- standing the higher military expenditure to address the increasingly frequent attacks at Guinea’s borders and the absence of any external budgetary assistance, The authorities also reduced nonpriority current and capital expenditure. The primary surplus therefore amounted to GF 127.8 billion at end-September, and the overall deficit (on a cash basis) was GF 137.5 billion, thus meeting the targets. 6. Fiscal discipline made it possible to meet the targets for net bank credit to the government and reserve money for end-September. However, the central bank’s reserve position continued to deteriorate, reflecting the use of foreign exchange for the additional military expenditure and external debt service, which resulted in a negative cumulative net transfer to the rest of the world of GF 121 billion (2.3 percent of GDP) for the first nine months of the year. In addition, owing to the shortage in the supply of foreign exchange, the central bank found it necessary to sell a portion of its reserves on the local foreign exchange market. 7. Substantial progress was made in the area of structural reform, especially in the management of government finances. The computerization of the public expenditure process, encompassing all budget and treasury operations, was completed on July 10,200O; a decree Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-48- APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT establishing the general public accounting regulations was signed on August 9,200O; and a reorganization of customs was undertaken on September 1,200O. To facilitate proper budget execution, the authorities have, since February 2000, been preparing a forward-looking monthly cash flow plan that compares monthly revenue projections, including external resources, with expenditure. This cash-flow plan, which is updated weekly, makes it possible to adjust expenditure to reflect priorities and available resources. Three of the four tax audits of major public enterprises were carried out. A review of the audit reports--for SOGEL (electricity), SEEG (water) and PAC (port authority)-indicates the need for a tax adjustment for all the enterprises audited, as a result of the underestimation of the assessment bases and underreporting on tax returns. Moreover, the application by some of these enterprises of VAT rates well below the legal rate had led to lost VAT revenue. The government has commented on the provisional report on the audit of customs tax invoices (bovderuux de taxation) and is awaiting submission of the final report. Finally, the audit of the central bank was completed in a timely manner, and the authorities have adopted an action plan for implementing the recommendations of the audit, which entails primarily strengthening the accounting units. 8. The national anticorruption committee (CNLC), which started operations in June 2000, submitted an interim action plan on July 7,2000, and will prepare a final action plan for its activities by January 2001. Moreover, the CNLC collaborates closely with the government oversight agencies (Inspection Gknkrale d ‘Etat, Inspection Gknkrale des Finances, and Direction Nationale du Contr4le Financier). These collaborative efforts have already led to the identification of misappropriations of funds in the public treasury and the fisheries sector, which, when corrected, can be expected to secure substantial revenues- including in foreign exchange- for the government. The CNLC will also monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the tax audit reports for public enterprises which it has recently received. 9. In the area of public enterprise reform, a decision was taken on August 18,200O to remove the senior management and board of directors of ANAIM, and to establish a committee to manage its personnel, and real and movable property, as well as ANAIM’s contracts and agreements, during the transition period. Revenues and proceeds from its assets are paid regularly into a treasury account with the central bank. Eight more public enterprises have been placed in liquidation, and the government’s shares in seven others were offered for sale on September 28,200O. Furthermore, a reform strategy for the public enterprises was adopted by the Council of Ministers on October 24. Reform of the National Social Security Fund (Caisse Nationale de SCcuritC Sociale) is continuing with the implementation of the recommendations of a technical assistance firm. III. ECONOMICANDFINANCIALPOLICYTOTHE Em OFTHEPROGRAM 10. There is a risk that Guinea’s economic situation may be seriously affected in the coming months by the continued aggression at its borders, which has clearly already led economic agents to adopt a wait-and-see approach and resulted in displacements of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-49- APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT population of the agricultural areas affected by the attacks. The economic slowdown, particularly in the transportation and agricultural sectors, is a major obstacle to the flow of supplies to hundreds of thousands of refugees living on Guinean territory. In addition, food security problems and related additional expenses will certainly have an adverse effect on government finances. As a result of the crisis, the government must maintain a level of military expenditure that is much higher than desired, aggravating its fiscal problems and exerting great pressure on the foreign exchange market, which is also suffering from the adverse effects of the considerable deterioration in the terms of trade. Finally, it now seems unlikely that external budgetary assistance can be mobilized by the end of the year, as initially programmed. This substantially complicates the financing of the budget deficit and the government’s efforts to pursue monetary restraint in order to limit the pressures on domestic prices and the exchange rate. 11. Despite this very difficult context, the Guinean government will continue to implement the budgetary program established in May 2000 until completion of the PRGF- supported program, and beyond. During this period, government finances will be managed on the basis of the detailed monthly cash-flow plan to ensure that unavoidable priority expenditures-including external debt service-are covered. The government will also resolutely pursue its structural reform program. Fiscal situation 12. Total revenue at end-2000 should reach GF 623 billion (11.6 percent of GDP), a shortfall of GF 15 billion relative to the revised program objectives, as a result of lost taxes on petroleum products prior to the domestic price adjustment and the impact of the frequent aggressions. The revenue situation may be improved by the collection of some unpaid duties and taxes from certain importers, and from the major public enterprises identified in the tax audits. 13. Expenditure will be limited to the additional military outlays required for the defense of the national territory, priority expenditure set forth in the budget law, and other expenditure that cannot be reduced, such as wages, domestic and external debt service, and consumption of public utilities. At the same time, to minimize the deficit to be financed, the government will further reduce nonpriority current expenditure and will slow the rate of investment expenditure financed with own revenue during the last quarter. Total expenditure is thus projected at GF 909 billion, or 17 percent of GDP. Further, it will not be possible to hold the volume of outstanding domestic payments arrears at the low level attained at end- September, owing to the government’s cash-flow problems, which will result in a smaller reduction of arrears than that projected in the revised program. The primary surplus will thus be GF 154 billion (2.9 percent of GDP), which is lower than the target revised in May (3.1 percent of GDP) but slightly higher than the initially programmed level (2.7 percent of GDP), while the overall cash-basis deficit of GF 185 billion will not exceed the revised target. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT 14. However, budget projections indicate a financing requirement for the last quarter of GF 45.5 billion, after taking into account project loans and external debt amortization payments due, including a US$l million payment on the Russian debt under an agreement reached with this key partner. This financing requirement is roughly the same as the amount of external nonproject support initially envisaged for this year, and will be covered on an exceptional and temporary basis by borrowing from the domestic banking system. The government’s net borrowing from the central bank increased by GF 47 billion between end- September and end-October 2000 to a level of GF 238.5 billion, which already exceeds significantly the limit set by the Central Bank Act (a net current account position of the treasury at the central bank equivalent to no more than 20 percent of total revenues of the previous year). The authorities intend to refrain from additional recourse to central bank financing and to lower gradually the indebtedness to the central bank to below the legal limit in 2001. In order to avoid any additional recourse to central bank credit, the government intends to issue new treasury bills, at a higher rate of interest that that of bills already in circulation. It is expected that these bills will be absorbed in large part by the commercial banks, using resources released by the reduction in the reserve requirement from 11 percent to 5.5 percent of eligible deposits effective December 1,2000, announced by the central bank in late November 2000. Based on this assumption, the recourse to net bank credit will increase from GF 46 billion at end-September to GF 92 billion at end-December, rather than declining as initially programmed. However, the supplementary monetary financing should be absorbed during the first quarter of 2001, immediately after the programmed budgetary assistance is disbursed. The authorities will attempt, to the extent possible, to place treasury bills with private enterprises in a comfortable liquidity position, which would reduce the requirement of additional bank financing. In addition, the Guinean authorities intend to ask Paris Club donors and lenders to defer the payment due in December by 30 to 60 days. Monetary policy 15. The need to finance the budget deficit with an increase in domestic credit will require rigorous monetary management to minimize the impact on the exchange rate and domestic inflation. Reserve money will increase by 17.1 percent during 2000, rather than the 14.5 percent provided in the revised program, and the money supply will grow by 20.9 percent rather than 17.2 percent. The central bank’s foreign assets will decrease further during the last quarter as the result of reduced inflows of external aid and substantial capital outflows to cover external debt service and expenditure in connection with the security effort. By contrast, relative to beginning-of-period broad money, net domestic assets will increase by 24.0 percent, primarily reflecting the increase in credit to government. As regards exchange rate developments, the shortage of foreign exchange on the auction market has caused the Guinean franc to depreciate against the U.S. dollar by approximately 12 percent since July 2000, and this trend may continue until the end of the year, notwithstanding the new measures taken by the authorities to enhance the integration of the informal exchange market into the official market (see below). 16. Monetary policy between now and the end of the program, and during the first few months of 2001, will emphasize the implementation of the recommendations of the central Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5l- APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT bank audit to strengthen its accounting and financial oversight procedures; the pursuit of the bank restructuring effort; and reforms in exchange market management and the conduct of monetary policy recommended by the IMF technical assistance missions. In the area of bank restructuring, the central bank will complete the harmonization of the licensing agreements for local banks by the end of the year. It has agreed with the World Bank on the treatment of Credit Mutuel de la GuinCe, either by the transfer of its operations to an existing structure, or by the creation of a new structure. The central bank intends to resolve the issue of the financial participation of the foreign partner in the recapitalization of one of the commercial banks in difficulty by end-December, and to decide the future of another bank after examining the various options. 17. The monetary authorities discussed with the last IMF technical assistance mission the conclusions of its report on the operation of the foreign exchange market and will adopt by the end of the year an action plan for implementing the recommendations. This plan will specify the respective roles of the commercial banks and their customers in the foreign exchange auction market (MED), and encourage automatic stipulation of purchase and sale orders as “at the market” or “limit” orders. By end-November, the central bank will also issue a new regulation for exchange bureaus, which will, inter alia, resolve the issue of the appropriate procedure for providing bond, and should facilitate their participation in the foreign exchange auction market through the commercial banks. Last, by end-November, the central bank will liberalize the conditions for foreign exchange accounts of the exchange bureaus held at commercial banks. This liberalization will, in particular, allow cash deposits and withdrawals, and the receipt of transfers in foreign exchange from abroad. For other holders of foreign exchange accounts, the liberalization will take place in March 2001. 18. Before receiving the final report from the IMF technical assistance mission on monetary policy, the central bank decided to implement some of the proposed measures-in particular, starting in November 2000, the issuance of very short-term central bank bonds to regulate bank liquidity, more effective projections of bank liquidity, as well as the lowering of the required reserve ratio from its present level of 11 percent to 5.5 percent. The central bank intends to adopt an action plan to implement the other recommendations, in step with the reduction of the exceptional increase in bank credit to the government at end-2000 and the attendant additional expansion of liquidity in the banking system. The authorities intend to discuss their liquidity management plans for 2001 with the Fund staff early next year in the context of the discussions on a new three-year PRGF arrangement. Structural measures 19. The government will ensure full implementation of all the structural measures foreseen in the program for end-2000, with emphasis on the reforms required to facilitate external aid disbursement, particularly the fourth structural adjustment credit (SAC IV) from the World Bank. 20. In the public enterprise sector, having already adopted the public enterprise reform strategy, the Council of Ministers will establish by the end of the year an independent unit Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-52- APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT responsible for the privatization of enterprises with the potential to become profitable and attract the interest of private investors. Further, a review of the regulatory framework for infrastructure was conducted with support from the World Bank, with a view to improving conditions for private investment in the water, electricity, transportation, and telecommunications sectors. An action plan for restructuring the energy sector should be prepared by the end of the year, under which the liquidation of the electricity company (ENELGUI) will be launched. 21. With regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the tax audits of the three enterprises for which the audit reports are available, reexamination of the VAT assessment base will make it possible to identify by the end of the year the definitive amount of tax adjustments required. A strengthened action plan will be adopted for these three enterprises by end-November to correct the problems identified in the audit reports and to establish a schedule for payment of the unpaid taxes. It was also decided that, beginning in 2001, SEEG, SOGEL, and SOTELGUI (telecommunications) would be subject to VAT from the billing phase. The action plan for SOTELGUI should be adopted by end-December 2000. With regard to the audit of the tax invoices (bordereaux de taxation-BDT), a listing of unpaid BDT balances by importer and type of tax will be prepared by end-December, using the computerized system of the Societtc GCnCrale de Surveillance (SGS). The importers involved will be asked to submit by mid-December proof of any payments made, and a schedule for the repayment of the definitive amounts to be paid will be established by end- December. 22. An international consultant has submitted a proposed automatic adjustment mechanism for petroleum product prices to the authorities; the proposal also includes a review of the domestic price structure. It will be discussed with the participants in the sector in the coming months, with a view to taking a final decision and effectively introducing this new mechanism no later than March 3 1,200 1. IV. 2001 BUDGET 23. A full macroeconomic framework for 200 l-03, and the details of structural reforms to be implemented in 2001 in support of this framework, will be established in February 2001 in the context of discussions with Fund staff on a new three-year PRGF arrangement. The main orientation of the draft 2001 budget aims at continuing fiscal consolidation while reflecting the -need to defend the national territory and to implement the national poverty reduction strategy in the context of effective delegation of authority and enhanced decentralization. The expected availability of official development assistance from external partners will certainly facilitate proper budget execution, However, considering the major difficulties that occurred in 1999-2000 as a result of delays in mobilizing this assistance, as well as the need to reverse the larger recourse to domestic bank financing during the last quarter of 2000 in the first months of 200 1, the execution of the 2001 budget during the first quarter will be based on a monthly cash-flow plan prepared with IMF staff. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT 24. The draft budget law provides for certain changes in the tax system in 2001, designed to enhance revenue mobilization. The lower limit for the fmed minimum tax (imp2 minimum firfaitaire) will be raised from GF 2 million to GF 3 million, and the upper limit increased from GF 20 million to GF 40 million, thus inciting a larger number of enterprises to make profit tax declarations, and the rate of the fixed levy (pr~Ztiementforfaitaire) applied at customs will be increased from 3 to 5 percent. In addition, the withholding tax at the source on local purchases by enterprises not subject to the VAT will be expanded to cover more enterprises. In the area of tax administration, the management of the single tax on vehicles (taxe unique SW Zes vkhicules-TUV) will be computerized for more effective tracking of taxpayers; a specialized investigation bureau to monitor and collect taxes in large enterprises will be established to enhance the effectiveness of tax audits; and a tax office will be established in Customs to improve monitoring of the application of the fixed levy and minimize abuse of the fixed rate system by importers subject to the VAT. All of these new measures combined should generate additional revenue of GF 5-6 billion for the year as a whole. 25. In the area of import duties and taxes, the assessment-processing fee (redevance de traitement et de liquidation-RTL) will be applied at the rate of 2 percent to all presently exempt mining company imports not directly used in the production process. Public works equipment temporarily admitted to Guinea should be subject to normal pro rata temporis taxation. Finally, temporarily admitted vehicles will be subject to an annual RTL payment on their residual value. These measures should generate approximately GF 4 billion in supplementary revenue. 26. In 200 1, the government will undertake a re-examination of the system of customs exemptions under the Mining Code, the Investment Code, and the special tax agreements and letters of establishment. It will prepare a plan to phase out this category of exemptions by renegotiating existing agreements and not renewing those that expire. It will also ensure that all new investments comply with the existing codes. With the improvements in the VAT assessment base, the tax adjustments resulting from the audits discussed above, and the effect of the ongoing customs reform and new airport customs clearance procedures, total revenue for 2001 is projected at GF 770 billion (13 percent of GDP), an increase of 23 percent over the level expected in 2000. 27. The budget law will also provide for an increase in the financial resources of local governments so as to involve them to a greater extent in providing public services, thus enabling them to play a more important role in the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy. Accordingly, effective in the 2001 budget year, 80 percent of the proceeds from the single professional tax (taxe professionnelle unique-TPU) and the single property tax (contributionfonciBre unique-CFU) will be transferred to the local governments, along with 50 percent of the TUV. 28. In the area of expenditure, the government will continue its policy of promoting the priority sectors---education, health, and agriculture. Current expenditure in each of these sectors will be maintained or increased in real terms, and the share of these outlays in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT total non defense-related current expenditure, excluding interest, will remain stable at 48 percent in 2001. Capital expenditure will also emphasize projects in the priority sectors. The government will begin in 200 1 to recruit qualified personnel in the priority sectors. To this end, the draft budget provides for an increase of GF 4.4 billion for these recruitments (as part of the wage bill) and for salary increases according to the merit principle, The government will begin a study on the reform of the civil service in 200 1. Total expenditure in 200 1 is projected at GF 1,009 billion (17 percent of GDP). The primary surplus will therefore increase to GF 2 16 billion (3.7 percent of GDP). 29. The government will clearly specify in the budget law for 2001 how the additional resources from interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative will be used, on which agreement was reached with Fund and Bank staff. This will be based on detailed estimates of the costs of the various measures recommended in the context of the poverty reduction strategy. This additional spending has been integrated into the baseline budget before its approval by the government on December 5 (a prior condition for the review), and the integrated budget will be submitted to the National Assembly. V. POVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATJXGYPAPER (PRSP)PROCESSANDHIPC INITIATIVE 30. Following consultation with its development partners and civil society, and in cooperation with the latter, the government has prepared the interim national poverty reduction strategy paper (interim PRSP). This document will soon be submitted to the Executive Boards of the IMF and World Bank, and the government sincerely hopes to reach the decision point under the enhanced HIPC initiative before end-2000. In consultation with the staffs of the Bretton Woods institutions, it also adopted a number of performance indicators in the areas of education, health, government finances, and good governance. These indicators will serve as conditions for the HIPC Initiative completion point. The interim PRSP presents a timetable and detailed budget for the participatory process of preparing the full PRSP, which will be completed by end-2001. The government will also involve its development partners in this process and intends to seek their technical and fmancial assistance to ensure that the process transpires smoothly. 31. With regard to the external debt sustainability analysis, the authorities have reconciled data on the stock of external debt with the support of experts from the World Bank and IMF. This exercise was carried out for the debt to multilateral institutions and bilateral Paris Club creditors, and will be completed for debt to other creditors by end-November 2000. 32. Despite efforts to keep the program supported by the third annual PRGF arrangement on track, two of six quantitative performance criteria and two quantitative benchmarks, as well as two of the seven structural performance criteria (one for end-December 1999), foreseen under the program were not observed at end-March 2000. However, the implementation of the interim program through September has brought the program back on Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 55 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT track. The government therefore requests that the Executive Board of the IMF grant waivers for the performance criteria that were not observed at the test dates.

Technical Assistance An STA technical assistance mission visited Conakry in early 1994 to review monetary and government finance statistics and the modalities for establishing the International Financial Statistics page for Guinea, which was published for the fust time in June 1995. Another STA technical mission visited Con&q in May 1995 to help in the compilation of balance of payments statistics. In March 2000, a STA real sector statistics mission was conducted to examine the overall compilation of data in this area. An STA monetary and finance statistics mission took place in November 2000. Three FAD technical assistance missions visited Conakry in recent years: in April-May 1994 to review the Guinean tax system and make recommendations on the tax reform needs, particularly in the areas of tax administration and indirect taxation; in January 1997 to review implementation of the value-added tax and make recommendations to improve revenue performance in view of the large shortfall experienced in 1996; and in March 1999 to advise on customs reform. An FAD advisor on tax administration was posted between April 1995 and September 1997 as advisor to the Minister of Finance. An FAD technical assistant on treasury management was posted in Conakry from January to June 1999. Another FAD technical advisor on customs reform was posted in Conakry from September 1999 to October 2000. MAE provided the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea with a principal advisor to the Governor from 1998 to 2000. A MAE mission took place during June 21-30,200O to advise on monetary operations, and a further one was conducted during October lo-24,200O to examine the foreign exchange auction system at the central bank. x. Resident Representative Mr. Le Bouder’s appointment as the Fund’s Senior Resident Representative in Conakry will end in October 2000, after he has served for three years. The new Resident Representative is Mr. Jean Claude Nascimento.

The main thrust of the World Bank’s country assistance strategy for fiscal years (FY) 98-FY 2000 (July-June) is to improve governance and institutional capacity, to enhance service delivery for poverty reduction, and to promote broadly based and equitable growth with a focus on the rural sector. This strategy is designed to put Guinea back on track toward financial viability and sustainable economic growth by redressing imbalances in the government’s finances, thus making it possible to redirect the country’s resources to the priority sectors, and by furthering structural reforms that will progressively eliminate the obstacles currently hampering the development of the private sector. 2. As of November 6,2000, total World Bank commitments to Guinea amounted to US$l,240.4 million, of which US$l ,123.5 million had been disbursed. Since Guinea joined the World Bank Group in 1963, the Bank has financed 57 operations in Guinea, including 3 IBRD loans totaling US$73.5 million and 54 IDA credits totaling US$1,166.9 million. The Bank’s active portfolio in Guinea comprises 13 projects, totaling US$246.1 million, of which US$119.2 million is undisbursed. The IFC’s portfolio totals 4 projects, with total commitments of US$9.2 million (fully disbursed). MIGA’s portfolio comprises 7 contracts of guarantee in the agribusiness sector equivalent to US$2.86 million in gross and net exposure. Total foreign direct investment facilitated to date is US$lO.3 million. The government has requested MIGA’s assistance in developing national strategies for agribusiness and tourism sector promotion. 3. Recent and proposed Bank Group projects have a broad sectoral coverage. In recent years, the World Bank has been active in rural development, education, mining, the financial sector, and public expenditure management. The Bank’s current assistance aims at improving service delivery for poverty reduction, with projects in health and nutrition, improving urban services and promoting rural development. An upcoming structural adjustment operation (SAC IV) will help to consolidate the progress achieved under the previous public expenditure management credit (PEMAC). In addition, the new operation will accompany the government’s efforts in the areas of public enterprise reform and governance improvement and corruption control. The Bank is also providing support for institutional strengthening and capacity building, with a focus on enhancing the government’s efficiency as a provider of basic public services. 4. In addition to its projects, the Bank is providing support through nonlending activities to assist planned lending operations, deepen the reforms in public expenditure management, define its approach to rural development, and strengthen the governance/capacity-building approach to civil service reform. Nonlending activities also play a greater role in helping to address specific strategic and capacity-building issues, ensure an active policy dialogue, and build consensus and partnership within the country and with key institutions and donors actively involved in Guinea.

Although improvements have been made in recent years in the availability of detailed government finance data, serious problems remain, in particular in the compilation of real sector statistics and in balance of payments statistics. However, changes in the financial system in recent years have affected the quality of data for deposit money banks. A law on statistics was approved in 1995, that organizes the institutional setting for producing statistics at a decentralized level. However, neither the National Council of Statistics, responsible for coordinating the production of statistics, nor a Technical Committee responsible for providing recommendations on the statistical program-both created under the new law- appear to have improved the quality of statistics. 2. Data are generally adequate for program monitoring, although frequent problems are encountered with the internal consistency of fiscal data and their consistency with monetary data. Real sector statistics 3. Statistics on the real sector are quite weak and incomplete. Only the consumer price index (CPI) is published on a regular basis, with other statistics being published on an irregular basis; in addition, they are not widely distributed and are often not reliable. There is no regular survey on mining and industrial production; nor are there statistics on employment and population. 4. After extensive work in 1990-93 to build a solid database for the national accounts, with technical assistance from the World Bank, the authorities produced final national accounts tables for the years 1986 to 1988 and provisional data for the years 1990 and 1991; an input-output table was produced for the year 1990. A comprehensive household survey was prepared for the year 1994. Provisional national accounts were produced for the years 1992-96, but they do not use fully the results of the household survey and have serious shortcomings. The Ministry of Planning and Cooperation prepared updates of macroeconomic data and projections on the basis of the 1994 national accounts, before it was eliminated in June 2000 and some of its functions allocated to the Ministry of Finance. In October 2000, the authorities presented final national accounts data for the years 1995-96, and provisional ones for the years 1997-98. All national accounts data were significantly revised at that occasion (see page 12). 4. The CPI for Conakry is available on a monthly basis, with a one-month lag. Export prices are estimated on the basis of information supplied directly by the mining companies, while import prices are based on a weighted average of partner countries’ export prices. Exchange rates are reported weekly. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - APPENDIX IV 5. Data on the agriculture sector have been published only sporadically in the form of Food and Agriculture OrganizationLJnited Nations Development Program surveys. No data on employment or labor costs are available. 6. In March 2000, an STA mission presented detailed recommendations on how to improve real sector statistics. The mission identified lack of a budget for the compilation of current statistics and poor professional training among the main causes of the statistical system’s weakness. Balance of payments statistics 7. The authorities have implemented some of the recommendations made by a balance of payments statistics mission in May 1995. Notably, coverage of trade in services, private transfers, and capital flows has been expanded by surveying service providers and large companies on an annual basis. However, the survey is not comprehensive and B there is no penalty for noncompliance. In view of the difficulties encountered with the compilation of annual statistics, the mission’s recommendation to compile data on a quarterly basis has not yet been implemented. 8. Merchandise trade statistics are reported in the standard Harmonized System of Customs Classification, net of imports by diplomats and transit trade. In spite of the technically advanced method of presentation, the presented data are clearly inconsistent with actual developments in the country. Some of these inconsistencies may be due to smuggling, as exports of gold and diamonds are subject to modest export taxes and imports are subject to import duties. However, the trade statistics also report significant exports of aluminum products, which are, according to the Ministry of Mining and Energy, not produced in the country. Thus, the data are substantially adjusted prior to publication. 9. The balance of payments statistics also affect the national accounts data. The national accounts are based on trade data that include transit trade and imports by diplomats, and thus overestimate the openness of the economy. However, the national accounts use estimates of trade in services, which are well below those estimated on the basis of the surveys conducted by the central bank. The authorities have requested additional technical assistance from STA for balance of payments statistics. Government finance statistics 10. Comprehensive monthly budgetary data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance on a cash basis for central government revenue and on a commitment and cash basis for central government expenditure; AFR staff receives preliminary data within 15 days and main final data within one month. Estimates for consolidated central government operations are made on the basis of treasury data. Budgetary data are often not internally coherent.

The government budget includes the bulk of all government spending, although there are a number of well identified “satellite” accounts that are not directly incorporated in the budget. There are also considerable differences between the GFS definition of general government and the general government sector. Moreover, autonomous funds, such as the Road Fund, are only partly incorporated in the budget. For the Road Fund, the largest autonomous fund, 100 percent of funds are ‘committed’ through the budget, and transferred from the budget to the fund. Actual disbursements are made at the Road Fund’s discretion (monitored, however, through its account at the central bank). The fuel tax is not expressly earmarked at the Road Fund, but is transferred to the general fund, and allocated to the Road Fund through the budget. Monetary accounts statistics 12. Monthly data on monetary authorities and deposit money banks are available. However, the lag for reporting data for publication in International FinanciaZ Statistics are usually submitted in batches with a lag of twelve months. The developments and changes in the financial system during the last few years may have affected the institutional coverage and the quality of monetary statistics. In particular, some banks have been liquidated, or restructured, while the two new commercial banks have been established. Although efforts are being made to strengthen the commercial banks’ accounting practices, in particular the classification of nonperforming loans, the quality of deposit money banks’ data is still weak. A money and banking statistics mission visited Conakry in the second half of November 2000 to review the coverage of the monetary statistics as well as data reporting and compilation issues, The mission summarized its main findings and recommendations in a draft report and action plan left with the authorities. A final report, taking into account the comments and suggestions of other interested departments and the views of the authorities, is being prepared.

Interest Rate Structure The central bank now establishes the minimum deposit rate for savings accounts (currently 7.5 percent) based on the observed inflation rate, with the aim of maintaining a slightly positive real interest rate. It also sets the maximum lending rate (currently 21.25 percent), which is determined on the basis of the maximum lending rates of the banks during the previous period. Interest rates are freely determined between these two limits. However, it is important to note that demand deposits, which represent 88 percent of all deposits, are generally not remunerated (although this is not prohibited). Each bank publishes its prime rate, which generally corresponds to its breakeven point (now 12.25 percent and 12.5 percent for the two largest institutions) and adjusts its credit rates depending on the customer. There is no real reference rate generally applicable to the entire system. The central bank also does not establish policy-related rates. However, it proposes various refinancing rates calculated on the basis of money market or rates on treasury bills. Treasury bills held by banks are subject to rediscounting at the initial interest rate (rate at issue) plus 5 percentage points; these bills can be used in repurchase operations at the latest money market rate plus 1.5 percentage points. Lastly, regulations governing the reserve requirement establish a penalty rate at least equal to the latest treasury bill issue rate plus 5 percentage points. All central bank refinancing rates therefore fluctuate on the basis of outdated or volatile market rates. Treasury bills are sold by means of open auctions conducted every week. The BCRG announces the amount to be offered, and the breakdown by maturity (7, 14,28,42, and 91 days) on the basis of its liquidity calculations. Each bidder submits only one bid (consisting of the amount to be purchased, together with a rate of interest) for each maturity. Originally, bids were accepted in order, from the lowest interest rate bid to the highest. However, the rules in place since March 10,200O require that bids at the highest rates of interest be accepted first. Until May 19,2000, bids were accepted at the actual rate bid (each successful bidder received the price that he had bid); since that date, bids have been accepted at the weighted average rate for the maturity. A practical consequence of this was a substantial increase in interest rates, which, for example, rose immediately from 9 percent to 13 percent for the seven-day maturity. On average the volumes sold have more than doubled, although they are still usually less than the volumes offered by the BCRG (increasing from GF 2.3 billion in the first quarter to GF 4.9 billion in the second quarter), The interest rate on 7-day treasury bills has remained roughly stable over the past months, fluctuating around 13.4 to 13.8 percent. Commercial bank lending rates have also held steady in the range of 13.9 to 18.5 percent, with a prime rate ranging between 11 and 12.6 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 73 - APPENDIX VI The MAE technical assistance mission of June 2000 thus recommended harrnonizing the interest rate structure and establishing the following hierarchy of rate (in decreasing order): the rate on the exceptional overdrafts of the banks’ current accounts with the central bank; the penalty reserve requirement rate; the maximum rate on bank loans; the refinancing window rate; the interbank market rate; the rate on bills auctioned by the BCRG; and the minimum interest rate on savings. It is proposed that the refinancing window rate become the BCRG’s main policy-related rate, which would serve as a point of reference for all other rates in the structure. Box 1. Guinea: Monetarization in Guinea The rate of monetization of the Guinean economy remains very low in comparison with other West African countries. As measured by the ratio of broad money (M2) to GDP, the monetization rate average about 9 percent during the 1990s. On the basis of narrow broad money (Ml), this rate was about 7 percent. Since the end of Guinea’s centralized economy, the pace of monetization has been slow, and the increase in GDP during that period has not been accompanied by an equivalent increase in the assets of the banking system. The small difference between M2 and Ml ratios indicates a relatively low volume of time deposits. At the same time, overall domestic credit was roughly equivalent to 6 percent of GDP and credit to the nongovernment sector represented only 4 percent of GDP, compared to an average of 20 percent in sub-Saharan African countries, and 70 percent in developed countries. The network of bank branches is very thin-the ratio of population to banking branches is one agency per 280,000 people. Moreover, the banking sector is dominated by two banks that hold more than 60 percent of the claims on the private sector. Credit to the private sector remains restrained by a tight monetary policy aimed at counteracting the monetary expansion resulting from the domestic financing of fiscal deficits.
