Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Iceland were held in Reykjavik during January 24-February 1. The staff team u met Mr. Fridrik Sophusson, Minister of Finance, Mr. Birgir I. Gunnarson, Chairman of Governors of the Central Bank of Iceland, the Secretaries- General in the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministries of Finance, Industry and Commerce, and Fisheries, other senior officials, and representatives of the employers' and labor federations and the financial and academic communities. Ms. Srejber (Alternate Executive Director) attended some of the meetings as an observer. Iceland has accepted the obligattons of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. 2/ All remaining exchange restrictions on capital transactions were lifted on January 1, 1995 in the context of the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement. The previous Article IV consultation with Iceland was concluded on January 24, 1994. On that occasion, Directors welcomed the reduction in inflation and the external deficit in the face of major shocks to export production and the terms of trade, emphasizing that the challenge ahead was to improve growth prospects while fostering financial stability. Against this background Directors called for firmer budgetary discipline and encouraged further progress on structural reforms, noting that the removal of remaining capital controls would heighten the importance of sound fiscal and monetary policies. A coalition government of the conservative Independence Party and the Social Democratic Party has held power since April 1991. General elections are scheduled for April 1995. II. Economic Background Between 1987 and 1993, Iceland's resource-based economy was buffeted by severe shocks. Following a sharp boom in 1987, real marine production and the terms of trade both declined by about 15 percent, leading to prolonged weakness in activity (Chart 1) and large external current account deficits that peaked in 1991 at almost 5 percent of GDP (Chart 2). As a result, net external debt rose sharply, while the previously minimal unemployment rate reached 5 percent (Chart 3). At the same time, wage moderation fostered by the weakness of activity and by the authorities' commitment to a stable I/ The team comprised Messrs. Fetherston, Arnason, Dare, Miihleisen (all EUl) and, as staff assistant, Ms. Moses (PDR). u Iceland continues to maintain exchange restrictions pursuant to UN sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and Iraq, which have been notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144-(52/51) on July 29, 1992 and September 10, 1990, respectively.

Helped by an improving external environment, the Icelandic economy recorded an improved output, inflatilon and external current account performance in 1994. However, the overall balance of payments deteriorated sharply as interest rate policies induced capital outflows, and treasury indebtedness continued to rise. The recovery of activity in 19!?4 was mainly export-led. Despite successive large reductions in annual cod catch quotas necessitated by past overfishing, recent fish catches have been better than expected, reflecting rising catches in distant waters and of fish other than cod. With power- intensive and other exports (especially tourism) benefiting from improved competitiveness and the international recovery, exports of goods and nonfactor services rose by over 6 percent in real terms, significantly outpacing import growth. As a result, the external current account moved into surplus for the first time since 1986, and real GDP is estimated to have risen by at least 2 percent- -a dramatic turnaround from the 2 l/2 percent contraction expected at the time of the last consultation. Following two years of sharp decline in domestic demand, investment stabilized (Charts 1 and 5) while private consumption increased by just over 2 percent, reflecting modest gains :Ln disposable income, lower real interest rates and improved confidence. Earlier progress in reducing hlflation was consolidated in the context of a restrictive national wage agreement for 1993-94 that provided virtually no nominal increases. The cost of living index increased by 4.7 percent during 1993--partly on account of devaluat%ons in late 1992 and mid-1993-- and by less than 2 percent in the 12 months to February 1995. The average unemolovment rate was about 4 l/2 percent in the fourth quarter, l/2 percentage point lower than a year earlier. 1/ Against a backdrop of labor unrest, a new wage agreement was concluded by the social partners on February 20. The agreement calls for private sector wage increases equivalent on average to 6.9 percent over two years payable 'in two installments (immediately and in January 1996), with additional increases for the lowest paid. These increases were substantially below unilons' initial demands, which ranged well into double digits, and are consistent with an inflation rate below 3 percent during 1995-96. To facilitate the agreement, the Government undertook (i) to replace the current credit terms index (used for financial indexation I/ On an annual average basis, unemployment rose in 1994 to almost 5 percent; however, this partly reflected effects of a labor dispute in the fisheries early in the year.

As in the past, the agreement is expected to form the basis for settlements in the public sector. Fiscal develoDments since the mid-1980s have been characterized by persistent deficits and rising treasury debt, with a tendency toward slippage from budgeted objectives (particularly on the expenditure side). Partly reflecting fiscal concessions to secure the 1993-94 wage agreement, the treasury deficit increased from 1.8 percent of GDP in 1992 to 2.3 percent in 1993 (Chart 6). The 1994 budget, despite an expected sharp contraction in output, targeted a modest increase in the deficit to 2 l/2 percent. Reductions in the rate of VAT on food (from 24 l/4 percent to 14 percent) and corporate income tax (from 39 percent to 33 percent), and increases in public investment were offset by expenditure restraint and higher direct taxes. However, with economic activity considerably stronger than expected, the outturn was a decline in the deficit to below 2 percent of GDP. The gross treasury debt/GDP ratio doubled to almost 50 percent between 1987 and 1994, reflecting persistent treasury deficits and, for most of the period, sluggish output. Also, local government finances have tended to weaken somewhat in recent years, and recorded a deficit estimated at 3/4 percent of GDP in 1994. Since late 1993, the authorities have been actively intervening in money and bond markets to hold down interest rates. Real yields on indexed government securities dropped in October 1993 from 7 percent to 5 percent, with the Government (as primary issuer) and central bank (as market-maker in the secondary market) declining to accept bids above that level; this approach spread across the maturity spectrum, and by late 1994 bids for krona-denominated paper were being accepted only for 3-month treasury bills. 2J 3J Nominal rates in Iceland's fledgling money market were lJ The nominal value of indexed financial obligations is adjusted in line with changes in the credit terms index, which between 1989 and early 1995 was computed as an average of the indices of the cost of living, wage costs, and building costs. The recent shift will reduce the impact of wage rises on the indexation of wage-earners' debts (such as mortgages). Previous changes in the credit terms index have had significant effects on financial asset values: the indexation provided between 1989 and 1995 reduced these values by 7 percent compared with what would have been provided by the pre-1989 index. 2J During the last quarter, proceeds of treasury auctions amounted to ISK 9.8 billion, of which ISK 1.1 billion was from sales of ECU-denominated S-year bonds, and ISK 8.7 billion from treasury bills. 3J In February 1995, maturing treasury indexed debt was partly refinanced at a slightly higher real rate of 5.3 percent.

These interest rate reductions were effected through a dramatic increase (equivalent to about 2 l/2 percent of GDP in the first half of 1994) in central bank holdings of government paper. Short-term interest rates have been allowed to rise in recent months, notably during the period after the :remaining capital account restrictions were removed at the start of 1995 and while uncertainty remained about the outcome of negotiations on a new wage agreement. Between November and mid- March, the central bank raised official short term rates in increments by a total of 210 basis points to 7.3 percent, and 3-month treasury bill rates rose from 5 percent 'in September to over 7 percent. Interest rates on indexed bank loans have fluctuated c:Losely in line with those on indexed government bonds, but nominal rates on short-term nonindexed bank loans have been unresponsive to money market rates (Chart 7). u The authorities' interest rate policies contributed to substantial capital outflows in 1994 and early 1995. As domestic interest rates moved below comparable rates abroad (Chart S), Icelandic companies and institutions had active recourse to the domestic bond market, partly in order to prepay external debt obligations. These flows, and the effects of portfolio diversification following the easing of capital restrictions, u contributed to a canital outflow in IL994 of over 5 percent of GDP, substantially higher than the current account surplus (Table 1). The resulting overall payments deficit was financed by a significant decline in the central bank's net reserve position, to the equivalent of about one month of imports of goods and services by end-1994 (from 2 3/4 months at end-1993). Private sector outflows continued at a similar pace in the first two months of 1995; assIsted by a Euromarket bond issue equivalent to about US$lSO million, reserves rose by about US$SO million to 1 l/4 months of imports. Despite the central bank intervention, the exchange rate weakened within the official band during 1994 (Chart 9). As of early March 1995, it was close to the end-Dec:ember level, having appreciated in early February at the time of the Euromarket borrowing. Mainly reflecting two devaluations in 1992-93 in response to external shocks, 1/ Iceland's real effective exchange rate (INS basis) depreciated L/ The spike in loan rates in the summer of 1993 occurred when banks raised nominal rates to recoup the adverse impact of the devaluation of the krona on their net liability position in indexed claims. u As of January 1, 1994, all restrictions on foreign investments in long-term securities by residents were removed. There are also no restrictions on investments by non-residents in long-term bonds. Restrictions on short-term capital movements were lifted on January 1, 1995. u The Icelandic krona was devalued by 6 percent in late 1992 during the ERM turmoil and by 7.5 percent in mid-1993 in response to a further deterioration in the fisheries outlook.

In addition, cost competitiveness of Icelandic firms wasfurther enhanced by the abolition of a tax o'n firms' operating costs and successive reductions in the corporate income tax from 45 percent in 1992 to 33 percent in 1994. III. Economic Outlook The latest officiall projections for 1995, taking account of the wage agreement concluded in February, show GDP growth of 2 percent, inflation picking up somewhat to ;! l/2 percent, and a decline in the current external surplus to just under 1 percent of GDP. Underlying these projections is a cautious view of export prospects: quotas for the 1994-95 fishing season (September-August) were reduced for conservation reasons, and marine exports are consequently expected to decline by 1 percent, with overall export volume growing by less than l/2 percent. 1/ Domestic demand is expected to strengthen moderately further, based on modest gains in consumption and a pickup in investment from recent depressed levels. As long as the recent turmoil in currency markets does not derail international recovery, the staff sees the balance of risks in this short-term forecast as on the upside; recent official projections have tended to underestimate both marine exports and manufacturing and services exports that have been fueled by Iceland's favorable competitive position. For the medium term, the official National Economic Institute projects average GDP growth of 1 l/2 percent per annum for the period 1996-98. This rate of growth would not suffice to absorb the existing moderate degree of slack; indeed, given Iceland's relati.vely rapid labor force growth (above 1 percent per annum), with appropriate policies the growth rate of potential output probably lies between 2 and 2 l/2 percent despite recent sluggish investment and modest fishing prospects. ?J Although a significant increase in the cod catch is unlikely--given spawning lags --before 1998 at the earliest, prospects for other exports, including other types of fish and power intensive products from existing capacity, as well as tourism, appear brighter. The staff's preliminary WE0 projections thus show a more robust outlook in 1995 and over the medium term (Table 2).

Prospects for such investment have improved considerably with the recent strong gains in international metals prices. IV. policv Discussions The discussions focused on the following policy issues for the current and incoming governments: (i) the heightened need--underscored by the worrisome and unsustainable recent decline in external reserves--for consistent exchange rate and interest policy in an environment free of restrictions on capital movements; and (ii) the importance of developing a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy to contain pressures on treasury finances and stabilize public debt. The conclusion, subsequent to the discussions, of the 'wage agreement appears to have averted a return to the high wage and price inflation of the past, but highlights the conflict between granting fiscal concessions to smooth the wage setting process and the need to take advanta,ge of the economic upswing to assure medium-term fiscal sustainability. 1. Exchanee rate and financial ~olih The Icelandic representatives reaffirmed their policy of stable but adjustable exchange rates, observing that this policy had served well in reducing inflation to low levels, while accommodating adjustment to real shocks and maintaining adequate competitiveness. At the same time, they recognized that as one of few currencies now formally observing narrow fluctuation bands, the Icelandic krona was potentially vulnerable-- particularly in the new environment of fully deregulated capital movements-- to attacks from speculators attracted by the prospect of one-way bets. To reduce the risk of such attacks, the central bank had in late 1994 put forward proposals to widen the band (from 2 l/4 percent to 5 percent each way) and shift from the present peg (consisting of a weighted average of the ECU, the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen) to a trade-weighted basket, but the Government had felt that these changes could be misconstrued by the market as a change in policy that could itself have destabilizing effects, The staff representatives agreed with the central bank's assessment of the potential disadvantages associated with the current narrow fluctuation bands. Furthermore, the staff suggested that a moderate widening of the band would not eliminate the risks associated with one-way bets; such risks could, however, be avoided in the context of a framework under which policies would be geared to maintaining a stable exchange rate over time, but without commitment ta1 intervention to defend any particular rate or band. In this regard, thLe staff pointed to the recent experience of another open economy in the regio'n that is also heavily dependent on resource-based exports (Norway), where a framework with these characteristics has been compatible with a high degree of exchange rate stability in practice. The authorities said that they had taken note of the Norwegian experience, observing that Norway's framework had evolved from the ERM-related turmoil Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - of 1992 and the forced delinking of the Norwegian krone from the ECU; the adoption of such a framework in Iceland would risk being perceived as a departure from the commitment to exchange rate stability and might create added uncertainty. For the same reasons, they did not consider that quantifying their medium-term inflation objective --while maintaining a focus on the exchange rate as a key intermediate indicator for policy--would offer any new benefits in terms of enhanced credibility. The authorities agreed with the staff that with the removal of capital controls, domestic interest rates- -which through financial market reforms have become increasingly market-determined in recent years--will from now on also be more sensitive to international financial developments and to investor perceptions of Iceland's policy credibility, and that under these conditions exchange rate and interest rate policies would need to be fashioned consistently. In this context, the staff representatives expressed serious reservations about the policy stance pursued for much of 1994 aimed at holding interest rates at artificially low levels through official intervention, at a time when interest rates elsewhere were generally rising. This approach had led to an unsustainable drain on international reserves that needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency, as well as a significant shortening in the average maturity of new treasury borrowing. The authorities pointed out that the long-term real rates of 5 percent that they sought for indexed government securities were still quite high by international standards. They also argued that a considerable part of the capital outflow in 1994 should be regarded as a portfolio adjustment to the opening of new investment opportunities abroad. However, the Icelandic representatives acknowledged that the looming general elections were an important reason behind the desire for low government bond rates because of their direct influence on mortgage interest rates. The staff representatives noted that the central bank currently operates under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce with some autonomy in operational matters, including in the setting of short-term interest rates to achieve the exchange rate objective set by the Government. However, government policies toward long-term interest rates had clearly had the effect of reducing the central bank's autonomy in its market activities. The Icelandic representatives observed that draft legislation that would grant greater independence to the central bank, simplify its mandate, and formalize in law the prohibition (currently the subject, since 1993, of agreement between the central bank and the Ministry of Finance) against central bank accommodation of the treasury through overdraft facilities had stalled in the cabinet. The staff representatives encouraged early reactivation of these legislative proposals. Iceland's financial system features widespread indexation and a significant public sector role in the ownership of financial institutions and the allocation of credit. Regarding the former, the authorities agreed that with inflation at historic and absolute lows, the time was ripe to encourage the progressive withering of indexation provisions. This would need to be done gradually in order to preserve confidence in long-term Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - financial contracts; to this end the authorities had already raised ,the minimum maturity for indexed bank de:posits to one year and had experimented with the introduction of nonindexed government securities with maturities of up to two years. The staff agreed with the general desirability of replacing indexed securities with nominal securities, but pointed out that the refusal to accept the rates set by the market undermined the introduction of longer term non-indexed government securities. Concerning the latter, the staff representative:; observed that the public sector's extensive role in the financial system hampered competition and appeared to be a factor underlying the sluggish response of bank lending rates to changes in the monetary policy stance. To this end, the staff encouraged the authorities to lprivatize 1celand"s state-owned banks (which currently account for about two thirds of bank credit), and to move forward with their plans to rationalize investment funds, transfer the housing bonds system to the banking sector, and reduce the issuance of treasury guarantees that add to contingent liabilities and foreign exchange exposure. 2. Fiscal ~olicv The discussions on fiscal policy focused on (I) the impact of concessions related to negotiations for the national wage agreement, and (ii) prospects for addressing increasing budgetary pressures that are anticipated over the medium term. The 1995 budget, as passed by Parliament on December 22, targeted a treasury deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP, close to the 1994 outturn. Both revenue and expenditure were prozjected to decline by about 3/4 percent of GDP, to 24.9 percent and 26.6 percent, respectively. On the revenue side, increased tax relief for pensioners, temporary tax relief to promote investment, and abolition of the highest bracket of the net wealth tax were partly offset by extension for one year of the temporary 5 percent surtax on higher incomes. The budgeted decline in expenditures reflected lower capital spending on infrastructure an'd a 3 percent reduction in transfers resulting from the removal of automatic cost-of-living increases and tighter enforcement of eligibility requirements. As in past years, the budget underwent significant revision after its original presentation in October. First, a subsequent boost to projected revenue from an improved macroeconomic outlook was more than offset by discretionary measures announced by the Government in December with the aim of fostering a positive climate for the then upcoming wage negotiations. In the discussions, the staff expressed concern that the concessions made in the December budget ,appeared premature given that the negotiations had barely commenced and unions had made no commitments to moderation in return.

L/ Taking account of additional fiscal concessions for the national wage agreement, net of projected revenue gains from higher incomes. The October budget proposal had also incorporated the Ministry of Finance's assessment of Iceland's medium-term fiscal prospects. This assessment indicated that, largely on account of rising transfers to households as a result of increased longevity, a/ by 1998 the treasury deficit would rise to 5 percent of GDP and the debt/GDP ratio to almost 60 percent. To reach budgetary balance by 1998--which would instead have yielded a slow decline in the debt ratio- -would therefore require additional discretionary measures. To this end, the budget proposal articulated broad plans for expenditure restraint, including a 5 percent cumulative reduction in public consumption through increased accountability and use of contracting out; more selective targeting of social security and agricultural transfers, which would reduce overall transfers by 6 percent; and cuts in public investment. In the discussions, the authorities explained that the goal of budgetary balance, and the expenditure measures to achieve it, were indicative plans to inform discussion of medium-term budgetary issues rather than policy commitments. The staff representatives pointed out that subsequent fiscal concessions made the achievement of medium-term budgetary balance more demanding and that the adoption of a credible consolidation plan geared to medium term budgetary balance should be a priority for the incoming government. Taking account of the further 1/ The fiscal concessions included the exemption of employees' pension contributions (4 percent of gross income), to be introduced on a phased basis between July 1995 and July 1997, and outlays to address the financial difficulties of homeowners. The gross cost when fully implemented by 1998 is estimated at 0.7 percent of GDP. u Nevertheless, compared to other European populations, the Icelandic population is relatively young and the population growth rate remains robust. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - concessions announced in February, the staff now estimates that if economic activity evolves in line with official expectations, the treasury deficit on unchanged policies could reach 6 percent of GDP in 1998, with the debt ratio exceeding 60 percent. In the area of tax policy, lche authorities announced in December (in the context of the measures to smooth passage of the wage agreement) their intention to introduce by 1996 a tax on capital income in the form of interest withholding (interest income currently is free of tax). The authorities recognized that, with capital movements free of controls, such a tax would have the effect of raising interest rates in Iceland. The staff representatives encouraged a revliew of the complex system of personal income tax allowances and rebates with a view to strengthening the treasury's revenue base and alleviating distortions; the authorities indicated that such a review would be a long-term exercise. 3. Other issues Prior to the downturn of the late 198Os, Iceland's labor market was traditionally characterized by very low unemployment rates--close to or below 1 percent for much of the period prior to the 1990s--resulting from persistent excess demand, and by a high degree of real wage flexibility that facilitated adjustment to shocks. In most respects, the Icelandic labor market is more flexible than that of Iother Nordic countries,or elsewhere in Europe. Reflecting this structure, the staff's assessment is that the NAIRU in Iceland is lower than almost anywhere in the industrial world--perhaps in the range of 3-4 percent, or somewhat below current unemployment levels. Iceland ratified the agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) on December 28, 1994, and thus became a founding member of the WTO. Iceland's m.f.n. tariffs are generally low and the country's Uruguay Round offer to reduce tariff bindings from a weighted average of 18 percent to 11.8 percent affects actual tariff lines only for the fish products sector. The main impact of the Round is in the agricultural sector, which has traditionally been heavily protected through a restrictive import regime and su'bsidies. Quantitative restrictions will be tariffled during 1995, with average tariff bindings then to be cut by 36 percent in equal steps over 6 y'ears; for meats, dairy products, flowers, and vegetables the reduction is to lbe the minimum of 15 percent. Minimum access opportunities are estimated to give imports of meat and dairy products, (hitherto virtually nil) a market share of 3-5 percent by the end of the 6-year period. The authorities did not anticipate difficulty in meeting their agricultural commitments, given the reductions in support already effected relative to the 1986-88 'base period. Iceland's participation in t'he EEA has already brought tangible effects in terms of access to the EU single market, adoption of the EU competition regime, and the removal of restrictions on capital movements. In the area of financial services, several London banks and foreign insurance firms had expressed interest in providing slervices in Iceland. The authorities noted Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - that the recent accession of three European Free Trade Association (EFTA) participants to the EU would mean a reduction in the size of the EFTA Secretariat, on which Iceland as a small country had relied quite heavily for technical expertise. At the same time, most single market legislation had already been transposed into Icelandic law and the pace of new legislation would therefore slow in the coming years. Faced with excessive depletion of fish stocks (particularly cod) in Icelandic waters, the authorities have taken a number of steps to strengthen fisheries management in recent years. These steps include tightening of loopholes (relating to catches out of season and catches by small boats) in the current system of fish catch quotas, and the establishment in 1994 of a Fisheries Development Fund (FDF) to buy out existing excess capacity in fishing and fish processing. The authorities indicated that the FDF had so far been operating satisfactorily, and had been instrumental in retiring about 10 percent of existing fishing capacity, compared with an estimated overcapacity of about 30-40 percent. While the FDF is to be funded from 1996 by a small fee (up to 1% 1,000 per ton of cod equivalent) on allocated fish catch quotas, the authorities indicated that there are no current plans to move beyond this toward a resource tax on fishing (or to a system of quota auctions) that would address the issue of appropriate pricing of the common property resource and reduce incentives to overfishing. V. Staff Annraisal Following several years of stagnation induced by severe external shocks, Iceland's resource-based economy is now enjoying a moderate recovery. Output rose by about 2 percent in 1994--a much better performance than expected a year ago- -as the effects of declining cod-catch quotas were offset by progress in export diversification; earlier success in curing chronically high inflation has been consolidated, with price increases held at or below 2 percent; and external adjustment to the earlier shocks has been completed with the current account now in surplus. These achievements notwithstanding, the staff has two principal concerns regarding the recent course of policies. First, efforts to set domestic interest rates by fiat have contributed to significant and unsustainable reserve losses that if left unchecked will place the authorities' fixed exchange rate policy at risk. Second, while the recent wage agreement--if followed by commensurate restraint in public sector settlements --suggests that Iceland is not likely to return to the high inflation that has characterized much of the country's history, the agreement entailed costly fiscal concessions that have further clouded a difficult fiscal outlook for the medium term. Against this background, the Government formed after the April 1995 elections will need to fashion policies to maintain noninflationary recovery and promote Iceland's longer-term growth prospects. Within the framework of the Madrid Declaration, these policies should focus on timely adjustment of 1 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - monetary conditions; on using the recovery to strengthen the fiscal position; and on further market-oriented structural reform. The authorities' .policy of stable, but adjustable, exchange rates has played a major role ovler recent years in reducing inflation to low levels, while accommodating adjustment to real shocks and maintaining adequate competitiveness. The removal of remaining restrictions on capital movements is a welcome further sltep in financial deregulation, but in the new environment a commitment to a stablfe exchange rate requires acceptance of flexibility in interest rates. Recent efforts to set both the exchange rate and interest rates are in clear violatia~n of this principle, and have led directly to capital outflows, pressures on the krona, and large reserve losses, to which recourse to foreign borrowing for reserve replenishment does not represent a sustainable response. Moreover, the practice of rejecting market bids for krona-denominated government paper at any but the shortest maturities is also detrimental to the development of financial markets and of effective policy instruments, constrains the central bank's ability to operate monetary policy, and ,undermines policy credibility. The staff therefore urges the authorities to allow interest rates on government securities to reflect fundamentals through the operation of market forces rather than being set by fiat. Moreover, the staff would caution against the issuance of government securities denominated in foreign currency --particularly at short maturities --as this could expose the treasury to undue risk #and undermine the development of domestic markets for krona-denominated instruments. In this latter regard, the issuance of nonindexed securities w.tth maturities longer than two years would help to enhance the effectiveness of monetary management. It would also represent a desirable step to reduce the scope of financial indexation in the economy. Future pressures to modify the credit terms index that is used to adjust nominal values of assets and liabilities for inflation should be resisted, given the resulting uncertainties for investors and associated interest rate premia. In the money market, the recent increases in official short-term rates were appropriate, and the staff hopes that they are a precursor to greater interest rate flexibility across the maturity spectrum. The authorities should be prepared to tighten monetary policy further in the very near term in light of international developments and market pressures. Iceland is now one of few countries with free capital movements and formal commitments to observe narrow exchange-rate fluctuation bands. In the absence of full policy credibility, the currency could be vulnerable to speculative attacks, possibly requiring damagingly high interest rates to prevent unsustainable reserve losses. The likelihood of such events could be significantly reduced were the authorities to indicate that while policies remain firmly geared to achieving low inflation by maintaining a stable exchange rate, the authorities are not committed to intervention to defend any particular rate or band; if the rate were to move outside its previous range, the aim would be to bring it back over time, except when major real shocks indicate a change in the equilibrium exchange rate and hence a need for nominal adjustment. In any event, if the operational Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - . short-term target of monetary policy is to be stability of the exchange rate, the interest rate consequences will need to be accepted. Iceland's external competitive position--barring external shocks--appears comfortable and should remain so under the terms of the recent wage agreement. The staff believes that the credibility of Iceland's financial policies would be enhanced by granting greater independence and accountability to the central bank, including the formalization in law of the agreement on the prohibition on treasury overdrafts and the issuance of a mandate to pursue price stability. Central bank independence should also provide greater assurance of mutual consistency between exchange-rate and interest-rate policies. Furthermore, while the central bank should have the right to operate in long-term securities markets for monetary management purposes as appropriate, its current obligation to act as market maker for long-term government bonds may frustrate market development objectives. The new environment of deregulated capital flows further underscores the importance of an appropriate fiscal stance geared to fostering macroeconomic stability and alleviating pressures on monetary policy. The deficit objective in the final 1995 budget was already modest in the context of a shift toward more favorable cyclical conditions, but in the wake of the recent wage agreement and the associated further fiscal concessions the treasury deficit is instead now likely to rise this year and, on unchanged policies, widen significantly over the medium term with a concomitant rise in treasury indebtedness. Moreover, the weakening of the financial position of local governments in recent years also gives some cause for concern. Against this background, a priority task for the incoming government should be the adoption of and- -in light of slippages in past years--strict adherence to the goal of medium-term budgetary balance as a minimum requirement for assuring macroeconomic stability. The expenditure-based measures outlined in the indicative medium-term framework presented with the October budget would be an appropriate starting point toward this end. However, as they would represent a significant departure from recent trends, their credibility would benefit from early specification and implementation by the incoming government. Regarding tax policy, a review of the complex system of personal income tax credits and rebates, with a view to strengthening the treasury's revenue base and alleviating distortions, would be desirable. The proposed withholding tax on interest income to broaden the tax base will need to be carefully designed in view of its implications for interest rates and capital flows. In the structural area, Iceland's financial sector reforms have already been extensive, but a significant agenda nevertheless remains. The staff encourages the authorities to strengthen competition in the banking system by incorporating and then privatizing Iceland's state-owned banks, to move forward with plans to rationalize investment funds, and to reduce the issuance of treasury guarantees.

The staff would also encourage the introduction of a resource tax on f.Lshing that would reduce incentives to overfishing and help stabilize the macroeconomic impact of fluctuations in this sector. Iceland's participation in the EEA and status as a founding member of the VT0 should bring important benefits. Given the extremely high level of agricultural protection in Iceland, the staff urges the authorities to view their Uruguay Round commitments in this area as a minimum, The staff also urges the Icelandic authorities to increase the level of official development assistance, currently below 0.1 percent of GDP, toward the UN target. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Iceland will be held on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.
