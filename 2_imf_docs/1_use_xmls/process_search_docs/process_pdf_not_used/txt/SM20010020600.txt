The staff team comprised Ms. Tseng (Head), Messrs. Rodlauer, Gruenwald, Duenwald, and Zebregs (all APD), Daniel (FAD), Blancher (PDR), Karacadag (MAE), and Messrs. Otani and Heytens (Resident Representative Office). Mr. Wei (OED) participated in the discussions. Messrs. Sugisaki and Teja joined the team during May 26-29. a The team met with Vice Premier Wen Jiabao, People’s Bank of China (PBC) Governor Dai Xianglong, Vice Minister of Finance Jin Liqun, Liaoning Province Governor Bo Xilai, other senior officials, representatives of the banking, business and diplomatic communities, and the World Bank Resident Mission in China. Staff from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank attended many of the meetings as observers. l In concluding the last Article IV consultation on July 26,2000, Executive Directors commended the authorities for their skillful macroeconomic management, which had helped China to successfully weather the Asian financial crisis, and for pressing ahead with difficult structural reforms. They urged the authorities to take full advantage of the favorable macroeconomic environment to accelerate structural reforms. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ determination to seize the challenges and opportunities of WTO accession to further the reform agenda, particularly reforms of the financial system and the state-owned enterprises (SOEs). While the policy of maintaining a stable exchange rate had served China well, Directors considered that conditions were favorable for moving toward greater exchange rate flexibility. 0 While progress has been made in recent years, China’s economic statistics need further improvement in many areas to facilitate analysis and Fund surveillance. STA continues to provide comprehensive technical assistance. The authorities are considering China’s participation in the GDDS. 0 China has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3 and 4 of the Articles of Agreement; exchange controls continue to apply to most financial account transactions. a The principal authors of this staff report were Markus Rodlauer and Paul Gruenwald, with contributions from other team members.

INTR~INJ~TI~N 1. Over two decades of market-oriented reforms have brought visible success and economic transformation to China. Since the start of reforms in 1978, GDP growth has averaged 9l/2 percent, raising real per capita income five-fold, and more than 200 million people have been lifted out of absolute poverty. The nonstate sector’ is now estimated to account for about 60 percent of GDP; and China has become more integrated into the global economy, with its share in world trade rising to about 4 percent. 2. Notwithstanding these achievements, a substantial reform agenda remains. Most importantly, difficult reforms-involving the SOEs and the financial sector-have yet to be accomplished. The weak performance of SOEs has burdened the state commercial banks (SCBs) with a large amount of nonperforming loans (NPLs). This not only hinders the development of sound and competitive corporate and financial sectors, but also creates contingent liabilities that could threaten medium-term fiscal sustainability. At the same time, rising unemployment from the reforms is causing social strains which are exacerbated by widening income disparities-between rural and urban areas, and inland and coastal provinces, 3. Balancing reforms and social stability thus remains the key challenge facing policymakers. The authorities recognize that China’s imminent accession to the WTO has increased the urgency of reforms and they are determined to push the reform agenda forward. The lo* Five-Year Plan approved by the National Party Congress in March 2001 stresses the efficiency of growth through further reforms and greater reliance on market forces. The Plan aims at annual average growth of 7 percent over the next decade, which the authorities view as important to absorb surplus labor from ongoing SOE reform and from rural areas; to deepen and broaden structural reforms buttressed by an improved social safety net; and to continue China’s opening to the outside world. II. RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS 4. Economic growth gained momentum during 2000, aided by supportive macroeconomic policies and a favorable external environment (Chart 1 and Table 1). The pickup in growth-which began in mid-1999 amid a strong rebound in exports- was driven by domestic demand. As in the previous two years when stimulative policies were adopted to counter the effects of the Asian I China: Contribution to Real GDP Growth, 1999-2001 I (In percent; staff estimates/projections) 1999 II 2000 Contribution from: Total domestic demand 8.8 8.1 Private demand 6.3 3.1 Government demand 3.2 4.4 Inventories -0.7 0.0 Net exports -1.0 -0.

However, imports increased even more quickly (partly due to higher oil prices and the anti-smuggling campaign, which boosted recorded imports) resulting in a small negative external contribution to growth. 5. Growth has remained robust in the first quarter of 2001, despite the weakening global environment. Real GDP growth rose to 8.1 percent, reflecting strong fixed investment (12l/ percent y/y) and retail sales (10% percent y/y).” Export growth, while considerably slower than last year, was still 143/4 percent due to a jump in exports to the European Union which partly offset a decline in export growth to the rest of Asia and the United States. Import growth also slowed sharply, reflecting the high import content of exports. Indicators through May suggest that domestic demand remained robust, although export growth slowed further (as did import growth). 6. Deflationary pressures seem to have eased, although data limitations prevent a full analysis.4 The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 1.7 percent in May (y/y), continuing a modest upward trend begun in mid-1999. This is largely on account of higher services and housing prices, as most other items in the CPI continued to decline. The staff estimates that core inflation-excluding food and administered prices, which together account for about half of the weight in the CPI-is roughly half the rate of headline inflation. 7. Unemployment and underemployment 12 remain serious concerns. Based on official data, the urban unemployment rate is 6.6 percent- 10 including registered unemployed and xiagang 8 (laid-off workers from SOEs) who have not yet found other work.5 However, analysts generally 6 believe the unemployment rate to be higher, 4 especially in cities with many SOEs. In addition, 1 the authorities estimate the rural labor surplus 0 I...".'.'. 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2 The authorities also attempted to raise private consumption with lengthened holidays. 3 Analysis of quarterly GDP developments in China is complicated by the lack of data on an expenditure basis, which are produced only annually and with a substantial lag. 4 From January 2001, the CPI has been based on a new, broader basket of goods and services. However, historical CPI data based on the new basket are not available, and only limited information is available on sub-indices and individual items in the basket. 5 As part of SOE reform, since January 1998 a total of 16 million SOE workers were laid off. The authorities estimate that this represents about one-half of the redundant workers in SOEs.

The annual need for nonagricultural jobs (mainly in urban areas) is estimated at 8-9 million.6 8. The external position has remained strong (Chart 2, Tables 2 and 3). The current account surplus rose slightly in 2000 (to 1.9 percent of GDP) due to an improvement in the services balance. The financial account surplus narrowed by ‘/z percent of GDP mainly because of an increase in foreign assets of Chinese banks related to the rise in foreign currency deposits (FCDs)-paragraph 3 l-almost all of which banks redeposited abroad).7 Nevertheless, foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio inflows were strong: FDI inflows totaled over $40 billion-China continued to be the largest recipient of FDI among emerging markets in Asia; and several large overseas share issues, including IPOs, brought in over $20 billion.’ Official reserves increased by $10.5 billion, to $170 billion, equivalent to 8 months of imports and about 850 percent of short-term debt. External debt (adjusted for discrepancies with BIS data) is estimated to have fallen to about 15 percent of GDP at end-2000, of which only one-eighth corresponds to short-term debt (residual-maturity basis). 9. External developments in 2001 continued to be generally favorable, especially compared with other economies in the region. Export growth, although declining, was 11 percent in May (year to date), apparently benefiting from the low share of electronics in China’s exports (around one-fourth, see paragraph 16 box). FDI and portfolio inflows9 have picked up, and reserves increased by nearly $14 billion through end-May. A $1.5 billion Eurobond was issued in May at relatively low spreads. lo 10. Over the past year, the renminbi has been allowed to stray outside its very narrow band. Since the Asian crisis, the renminbi has been kept mostly within a very narrow range of +/- 0.02 percent. l1 Since April 2000, however, it has often been allowed to 6 The World Bank estimates that every 1 percentage point increase in GDP is associated with 0.8-l million new jobs. 7 Statistical weaknesses prevent a fuller analysis of developments in the fmancial account. ’ China has become a dominant player in the ADR/GDR market for emerging market corporations, accounting for about half of the $42 billion equity issuance in 2000. ’ Including $7.6 billion repatriated by China Mobile from a share issue last year. lo The issue (designed to provide a benchmark for possible future corporate issuance) comprised a lo-year, $1 billion tranche priced at 133 bp over comparable U.S. Treasuries, and a 5-year, e550 million tranche priced at 35 bp over midterm em-o swaps.

Markets have tended to interpret these events as “trial balloons” toward more flexible management of the rate. The discount on the renminbi in the (off-shore) non-deliverable forward (NDF) market has remained broadly stable (around 3 percent for one-year NDFs). In real effective terms, the renminbi is estimated to be slightly above its pre-Asian crisis level; the current account surplus and continued growth of export market shares suggest that the currency is not overvalued. 11. Fiscal policy has remained supportive of growth, although buoyant revenues allowed a small reduction in the budget deficit last year. After peaking at 4.0 percent of GDP in 1999, the budget deficit narrowed to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2000 (Chart 3 and Table 4). Revenue was 1% percent of GDP higher than budgeted, partly reflecting exceptional factors such as higher oil company profits and a booming stock market; the anti- smuggling campaign and ongoing improvements in tax administration, as well as the reestablishment in late 1999 of income tax on interest from savings deposits, also contributed. All of the revenue windfall was spent, including through a midyear fiscal stimulus package (the third in a row) of l% percent of GDP. In early 2001, revenue growth accelerated further, with inflows through April 29 percent higher than last year. The increase is attributable to the pickup in activity as well as continued improvements in tax administration. Expenditures have also been higher than budgeted, growing by16 percent. 12. Monetary conditions continue to be accommodative. Following a series of cuts in domestic renminbi interest rates-to well below comparable U.S. rates-domestic rates have been unchanged since mid- 1999. With deflationary pressures easing, real rates have thus continued to fall. The interest rate differential in favor of U.S. dollar assets has induced rapid growth of foreign currency deposits (paragraph 3 1, Chart 3), although this has slowed recently with the reduction since late 2000 of domestic U.S. dollar rates (following rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve). l2 Broad money (M2) growth has continued to trend downward; at 12 percent at end-May it was below the bottom of the PBC’s target range of 13- 14 percent (Table 5).i3 Loan growth was at 14 percent through May, bolstered by consumer and mortgage lending which accounted for around one-fourth of the increase. ;i* Equity prices rose strongly in 2000 and early 2001. Prices in the A-share market enominated in local currency and reserved for domestic investors) rose by over 50 percent, the largest gain of any major regional market (Chart 4 and Box 1). The increase has been attributed in part to market-boosting measures, including lower brokerage fees, the tax on savings deposit interest noted above, and widening investor access to the market l2 The one-year U.S. dollar deposit rate is now 2.7 percent, down from 5.5 percent in mid-2000. l3 Including FCDs (which are not included in the official definition), broad money growth was 12.7 percent.

China’s Stock Market China’s stock market has grown rapidly in recent years, and is now Asia’s second largest behind Tokyo (first chart). This rapid growth reflects the greater role in China’s reform process given to capital markets since the 15” Party Congress in September 1997. At that time, the authorities decided to increase listings on domestic and r international stock markets (second chart) to help finance the cost of enterprise restructuring and impose greater market discipline on SOEs. Domestic investors with ample savings and few investment alternatives have also responded enthusiastically to official efforts to encourage greater stock ownership-the number of retail investors on the domestic bourses has increased 50 percent since mid- 1999 to over 6 1 million (about 40 percent of urban households)--making China’s stock market the best performing in the world over the past year.

The domestic currency “A-share” market remains closed to foreign investors, and trading in B-shares was dominated by domestic investors (using regulatory loopholes) even before the market was legally opened to them in February 2001. Foreign - investors’ interest in the B-shares market has been China: Share Capital Raised by weak because of its illiquidity, poor performance of Domestic Companies, 1993-2000 listed companies, and weak disclosure requirements. Instead, foreign investors have preferred investing in , Dom&ic MarkeLs(A- and B-shares) I Chinese enterprises listed or incorporated in Hong Kong SAR (“H-shares” and “red chips,” respectively) and elsewhere, with their more stringent listing requirements and stronger regulatory framework. The opening of the A-share market to foreign investors and its merger with the B-share market is expected to come only very gradually, reflecting the authorities’ cautious approach to financial account liberalization. China’s equity market is segmented and poorly regulated, and has long produced large asset price anomalies. The domestic securities industry has been plagued by market fraud and speculation has been rampant throughout its short history. Moreover, the domestic stock market has tImctioned primarily as a funding vehicle for poorly-performing SOEs since its inception in late 1990, and has done little to improve the performance or corporate governance of listed companies. Indeed, several major share price manipulation scandals have come to light over the past year, and staff analysis indicates that China’s 1,100 domestically-listed companies are financial very weak (see Box 3). Nevertheless, price-earnings ratios for A-shares (currently averaging about 60 in Shanghai and nearly 80 in Shenzhen) have historically been at least 3-4 times higher than those of the same firm in the B- and H-share markets, reflecting the high pent-up demand for equity among Mainland investors and the small number of actively traded shares.’ With $75 billion in individual foreign currency deposits, the formal opening of the B-share market to domestic investors has resulted in considerable price convergence in recent months: A-share prices are now about 50 percent higher than B-share prices of the same firm, down sharply t?om four times higher in mid-February. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has embarked on a broad initiative to improve transparency and market fundamentals. In recent months, the CSRC has initiated a crack down on fraud and market manipulation, issued tighter roles to delist chronic loss-making enterprises, and imposed more stringent disclosure requirements on listed companies. In addition, the quota system that placed listing decisions in the hands of local governments was abolished in early 2001 in favor of a system based on commercial criteria, and the CSRC recently moved ahead with China’s first ever delisting. Technical preparations for the “second board” in Shenzhen (for dynamic, mainly nonstate, small and medium enterprises) have been completed, but its launch has been delayed in part due to concerns about market conditions. ‘To preserve majority state ownership and control of listed companies, only a small portion (I/3 or less) of shares are sold to the general public and actively traded on the secondary market.

Prices in the B-share market (denominated in foreign currency and reserved for foreign investors) also rose, fueled by speculation that the A-share and B-share market would be merged. Following the opening of the B-shares market to domestic investors in February 2001, B-shares surged by some 200 percent, largely closing the gap with the A-share valuations.14 With this runup, the average price-earning ratio in both markets is currently about 70. 14. China’s WTO accession regained momentum in June 2001 following agreement with the United States and the European Union on outstanding issues (mainly relating to agricultural subsidies, insurance, and retail distribution). l5 The remaining negotiations- mostly at the multilateral level (one bilateral negotiation remains)-will focus on finalizing the terms of the Protocol of Accession. Completion of these final steps would pave the way for China’s accession, possibly by the time of the WTO ministerial meeting in November 200 1. Meanwhile, continued progress is being made in adapting domestic laws and regulations to WTO requirements, including by moving toward the unification of the corporate tax regime between foreign- and domestically-owned firms; revoking the requirements for foreign-invested firms regarding local content, export/production minima and foreign exchange balancing; and amending patent and customs laws. III. OUTLOOK AND ASSESSMENT OF VULNERABILITIES 15. Although growth is likely to moderate in the coming months due to the global slowdown, China’s near-term macroeconomic outlook remains favorable. Real GDP is projected to increase by 7% percent in 2001, sustained by strong investment growth (from the government’s investment program) and private consumption.

The near-term risks to this outlook appear limited. Standard external vulnerability indicators are favorable: the current account is in surplus; external debt is low; and official reserves are high. China’s economy is also less exposed to the global slowdown due to its relatively limited openness, low China: External Vulnerability Indicators dependenceon 1997 1998 1990 2000 high-tech exports Current account balance/GDP (in percent) 4.1 3.1 1.6 1.9 (text box), and External debt/GDP (in percent) 19.4 19.0 17.5 15.2 restricted External debt/exports (in percent) 95.6 97.8 89.0 66.1 Official reserves (uS$ billions) 143.4 149.8 158.3 168.9 convertibility of OlIkial reserves (in months of imports and gnh) 10.4 11.0 10.0 8.1 the renminbi.

However, a more prolonged global slowdown than presently envisaged would pose a greater risk, especially as slower GDP growth in China could make progress with reforms more difficult due to social constraints. StalT estimates suggest that in a scenario with zero U.S. growth and global growth of 2 percent (compared with 1.5 percent and 3.2 percent., respectively, in the May WEO), GDP growth in China would be lower by 0.8 percentage point.’ The current account surplus would widen by I% percent of GDP as lower export growth is more than offset by reduced import growth (stemming from the high import content in exports, lower domestic demand and reduced FDI inflows). In case of a major disruption of capital flows to emerging market economies, China’s financial account would also be affected through lower FDI and portfolio inflows. The overall balance of payments could weaken markedly, perhaps by about $10 billion compared with the baseline scenario of a surplus of $17.4 billion in 2001.

The medium-term outlook depends on structural reforms and the impact of WTO accession (Annex I). In a baseline scenario with WTO accession in late 2001 and accelerated structural reforms, growth is likely to moderate initially, from increased foreign competition and output losses from SOE and SCB reforms. However, this should be followed Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- by higher growth as efficiency and productivity improve.16 The external current account surplus would gradually narrow, reflecting the impact of trade liberalization and FDI-related import growth. The overall balance of payments position would nevertheless remain strong, given the projected increase in FDI and portfolio inflows. 18. The medium-term outlook is clouded by risks stemming from the unfinished reform agenda. The difficult financial situation of state banks and enterprises implies systemic risks (currently contained by high depositor confidence in the state’s implicit guarantee) and major quasi-fiscal losses. The medium-term fiscal position is further burdened by spending needs to strengthen the social safety net, address income disparities, and for health, education, infrastructure, and the environment. These risks are exacerbated by governance and transparency problems and statistical weaknesses which increase the margin of error in assessments. Iv. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 19. The authorities are focused on maintaining stability while pushing forward the intertwined banking and enterprise reforms. While much progress has been made, they recognize the need to deepen and broaden reforms to ensure sustained rapid growth. They are well aware that the remaining task is large and made more difficult by a myriad of constraints (social, political, legal, and institutional), but are determined to push ahead. With broad agreement between the authorities and the staff on the macroeconomic outlook and policies, the discussions focused on exchange rate policy, structural reforms, and medium-term fiscal sustainability. A. Exchange Rate Policy . 20. The authorities agreed with the staff about a gradual move toward greater exchange rate flexibility. As in recent consultations, the staff reiterated that greater exchange rate flexibility remained essential for China given the major structural changes underway, existing factor market rigidities, and the country’s increasing integration into the world economy. At the same time, a move to greater flexibility should be carefully managed to minimize disturbance to the domestic and neighboring economies. Specifically, the staff advised that: l The move should be madefrom aposition of strength. Although circumstances were more favorable last year, China’s current economic conditions-rapid growth, a current account surplus, and high and rising reserves-are still sufficiently strong to allow a first step toward greater flexibility. l6 For a discussion of the link between growth and FDI, see the forthcoming Selected Issues paper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- l The move should be gradual. Staff welcomed the greater use of the existing trading band and encouraged its full use in the period ahead, followed by gradual widening of the band and its link to a basket of currencies.‘7 l The move should be made sooner rather than later, although not at a time of turbulent market conditions. A gradual move should not have untoward negative effects on regional markets, since vulnerabilities of other emerging market economies in the region are much lower than during the Asian crisis. In particular, current account positions, and reserves and short-term debt ratios are much more favorable, and exchange rates more flexible. Moreover, there appears to be more differentiation by international investors across emerging markets. The authorities should monitor market conditions closely when timing the move. In this context, a move would not be advisable in the midst of a sharp deterioration in world financial markets. l Greaterflexibility should be accompanied by measures to strengthen market infrastructure and the regulatory framework, including development of the foreign exchange market and improved supervision of banks’ foreign currency operations. 21. The authorities said they shared the staff’s views on China’s exchange policy. They agreed that China would benefit from greater flexibility, adding that, while the stability of the renminbi had served China and the region well during the Asian crisis, if kept too long it could mislead the markets to think that the exchange rate was fixed. They would monitor market conditions closely to ensure the appropriate timing. B. Fiscal and Monetary Policies Short-term fiscal policy 22. The staff supported the fiscal policy stance contained in the 2001 budget which strikes a balance between supporting growth and medium-term sustainability. While fiscal policy in recent years has rightly been geared toward supporting domestic demand, the staff observed that medium-term considerations increasingly limit the scope for continued reliance on fiscal policy to do so. The 2001 budget targets an overall deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP, 0.4 percentage points lower than last year. This is broadly in line with the gradual medium-term adjustment path recommended by the staff. The reduction in the deficit comes mainly from higher revenue, while spending is set to remain high, particularly on education, agriculture, and defense, as well as to develop the western and poorer regions in China. In addition, there was a 30 percent increase in the basic civil service salary, while some other budget items, including subsidies, were cut substantially. r’ For more details about the modalities of moving to greater exchange rate flexibility, see Staff Report for the 2000 Article IV Consultation (SM/OO/150,7/6/00, paragraphs 19-21).

The authorities agreed with the staff that another midyear fiscal stimulus package was not needed given the current outlook. They added, however, that the recovery was not yet fully self-sustaining and would likely need continued support from “proactive” policies for several years. While this would constrain fiscal consolidation to a gradual pace, they explained that policies to support domestic demand were more broadly based on the gamut of reforms to stimulate the nonstate sector (e.g., housing reforms) and rural development, not just fiscal expansion. 24. The staff welcomed the ongoing efforts to strengthen tax revenue, which were already yielding results. The continuing rise in the revenue-to-GDP ratio demonstrated, in particular, the successful strengthening of tax administration in recent years (an area where the Fund has provided technical assistance). The authorities’ future plans include broadening the value-added tax (by including services) and moving it to a consumption basis (from the current production basis); higher excise taxes and a new fuel tax; rationalizing tax preferences; ‘* and moving toward a comprehensive personal income tax. The staff supported these plans, and noted the need for continued upgrading of tax administration capabilities (which also must not be overburdened by a premature move to individual income tax filing). 25. Should revenue continue to overperform, the staff advised that the bulk of the additional resources be set aside for deficit reduction or medium-term reform needs. On current trends, revenue is likely to exceed the 2001 budget target by some 1 percent of GDP (similar to last year’s over-performance). The authorities explained that higher revenue would mainly be channeled to priority areas such as investment in the poorer regions, social security reform and raising civil service wages and pensions for retired civil servants. Even so, a small part of excess revenue could also be used for deficit reduction. Medium-term fiscal policy 26. Medium-term fiscal sustainability remains an important source of vulnerability (Table 6 and Box 2). While China’s explicit deficit and debt stock (23 percent of GDP) are modest, a broader measure shows that the fiscal position is weak. Taking into account the need (ultimately) to cover the losses in the banking system, the fiscal deficit is on the order of 6-7 percent of GDP, and public debt about three-fourths of GDP. The outlook is burdened further by the future costs of social security reform, infrastructure, and other social needs. The staffs illustrative medium-term scenario shows that, without adjustment, public debt would exceed 90 percent of GDP by end decade. To reduce and stabilize the public debt-to- GDP ratio at around 60 percent, new NPL growth needs to be curtailed sharply and the budget deficit lowered by some % percentage point of GDP per year. The adjustment in the state budget will have to come mostly from higher revenues, although it will also be necessary to reallocate expenditures further toward priority areas (see Box 2). ‘*A forthcoming Fund technical assistance mission will address the issue of tax preferences.

China: Fiscal Challenges in the Medium Term Atfirst glance, fiscal sustainability does not appear to be a pressing issue for China: the oftcial debt stock is low and the state budget deficit modest. However, taking into account quasi-fiscal activity and other important public liabilities, the broader budget deficit would more than double and the debt-to-GDP ratio would more than triple. Moreover, the combination of identified developmental spending needs and quasi-fiscal pressures going forward imply that managing the public finances will require sustained adjustment. Broader measures of public finances The state budget deficit, broadly measured, was over two times the officially reported amount in 2000. The reported deficit in 2000 was 2.8 percent of GDP; however, the official statistics exclude important public liabilities including: funds borrowed by the central government and on-lent to local governments; official external lending to government agencies; and new non-recoverable loans in the financial system. Adding in these factors, the fiscal deficit was likely on the order of 6-7 percent of GDP. Total public debt at end-2000 was about three-fourths of GDP, probably higher. This comprises: (i) the explicit government debt stock of 23 percent of GDP, of which 18 percent of GDP was domestic (including recapitalization bonds and bonds used for on- lending to local governments); and (ii) non- recoverable loans of the financial system, which the staff estimates at between 5 1 percent and 74 percent of GDP (see table). Total public debt at end-2000 was thus between 74-97 percent of GDP; in the analysis below the lower bound of this range is used.

Moreover, these estimates do not include the cost of pension system reform (since the system will not run large deficits in the coming decade), which is estimated at almost 100 percent of GDP by the World Bank. Intergovernmental transfers should be expanded. The current system requires each province in China to be more or less fiscally independent. As a result, per capita expenditures vary greatly (in light of the high variance of income). This problem also affects other issues; e.g., the social security system suffers from major horizontal imbalance, and China’s high degree of fiscal decentralization makes it difficult to pool risks across provinces. Strong growth alone will not solve China’s public debt china: Public Debt Fnjeetions (pament of GDP) problem. Staff calculations show that reducing the debt-to- 100 GDP ratio to prudent levels requires sustained-though manageable-adjustment in the state budget as well as SOE and financial system reform to reduce new NPLs. Specifically, if the expenditure-to-GDP ratio is allowed to continue to trend ” upward and new NPLs are not curbed, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to over 90 percent of GDP by 2010. Alternatively, if new NPL growth is curtailed and the budget deficit reduced by some r/i percentage point of GDP per year 50 (mainly by higher revenues), the public debt-to-GDP ratio will 2001 2004 2007 2010 fall to 60 percent of GDP by 2010 (see chart). Managing the debt dynamics Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- 27. The authorities agreed that the budget faced large contingent liabilities and spending needs, which they considered to be manageable by reforms and in an environment of rapid growth. In particular, they expected the reforms in the banking sector to sharply diminish the flow of new NPLs (paragraph 36) while the existing stock of NPLs would be reduced by the recovery efforts of the asset management companies (AMCs) and the banks themselves. The budget would benefit from continued revenue growth, buttressed by the planned further improvements in the tax code and tax administration. On the expenditure side, they foresaw growing private sector participation in infrastructure, which would release public funds for other priorities such as education, pension reform, and the environment. This should permit a gradual reduction of the deficit broadly in line with the staff s “adjustment” scenario. 28. The staff welcomed the authorities’ determination to deal with the NPL problem and to reduce the budget deficit. However, the staff pointed out that even with favorable assumptions on growth, interest rates, and contingent liabilities, stabilizing the fiscal outlook was a major challenge. In addition to reducing the budget deficit on a sustained basis and sharply reducing the flow of new bad loans, it will also be necessary to limit the future costs of the pension system (paragraph 44). Moreover, the system of fiscal federalism will need to be reformed to ensure an appropriate level of transfers to the poorer regions while leaving sufficient resources at the disposal of the central government. Monetary policy 29. Monetary policy remains accommodative. The PBC’s target for M2 growth in 2001 is 13-14 percent, similar to last year’s outcome. The easing of deflationary pressures has led to some relaxation of monetary conditions via lower real interest rates. Keeping domestic interest rates low has been facilitated by the sizable reduction in onshore U.S. dollar rates, thus easing earlier concerns about the impact of the differential between U.S. dollar and renminbi rates on the financial account. 30. The staff encouraged further progress with the gradual liberalization of interest rates. Bands around renminbi lending rates have been gradually widened, and in September 2000 foreign currency loan and deposit rates (over $3 million) were freed. lg The remaining stages of the plan are to free lending before deposit rates, wholesale before retail rates, and rates in rural before urban areas. The staff broadly agreed with this sequencing, noting that liberalization needed to be accompanied by progress in the boarder structural reforms lg Since October 1999, banks are allowed to set renminbi lending rates within a margin of +3 O/- 10 percent (around the official lending rate) for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in urban areas (+ 1 O/- 10 percent for SOEs), and since January 1998, +50/- 10 percent for SMEs in rural areas. In September 2000, banks were allowed to set rates for FCDs and foreign currency loans above $3 million (the Chinese Association of Banks, established in early 2000, was given the authority to set rates on FCDs below $3 million). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- 31. The authorities agreed with the staff that the rapid growth of FCDs required close prudential oversight. FCDs have risen to $135 billion (at end-May 2001), equivalent to 9 percent of total bank deposits and almost three-fourths of official reserves. The staff pointed to the potential vulnerabilities, 20 including currency, credit, and liquidity On-shore foreign currency actidie~ end-2000 risks for the banks and the contingent @I-I percent of GDP) claim on official reserves given state underway to harden budget constraints on SOEs and commercialize SCBs. The staff further noted the importance of setting a clear and reasonably ambitious timetable for the liberalization so that banks can prepare for the new business environment. ownership of the major banks. To manage these risks, the staff recommended close prudential supervision of banks’ foreign currency operations to ensure the credit quality and liquidity of banks’ foreign assets, and by enforcing the relevant china Indonesia KOW33 Malaysia Philippines regulations.20 The authorities broadly q Foreign tummy deposits HForeign currency loans agreed, noting that foreign currency lending was currently subdued (in part because of the relatively low renminbi interest rates-which might, of course, change in the future). C. Structural Reforms Financial sector reform 32. Drawing lessons from the Asian financial crisis, the authorities have taken steps to reform China’s financial system over the past several years. These have included: 0 Reduced government interference in SCB operations. With the termination of the credit ceiling system in 1998, the SCBs have gained greater independence in their operations. Steps were taken to strengthen governance (e.g., the installation of boards of supervisors and boards of directors for the SCBs), improve internal controls (separating loan analysis and approval, centralizing the latter), and develop a credit culture. 0 Recapitalization ofSCBs. In 1998, the Ministry of Finance issued Y 270 billion (3% percent of GDP) in bank restructuring bonds to recapitalize the SCBs. 2o These include a minimum liquidity ratio of 60 percent; a cap on foreign currency loans (85 percent of FCDs, and 60 percent of FCDs for loans over 1 year residual maturity); and a limit on banks’ open foreign currency positions of 30 percent of capital (which should be tightened).

In 1999 and 2000, Y 1.4 trillion (15% percent of GDP) of nonperforming loans from the state banks were transferred to four AMCS.~~ The AMCs have since initiated the process of asset resolution (see text table).

Work has begun on an improved loan classification system, tighter provisioning rules, and to strengthen the PBC’s supervisory capacity. A number of large banks are already classifying loans under a new system (closer to international best practice), in parallel with the old system (which remains the regulatory norm). l Increased transparency and realism in approaching problems in the financial sector. Some SCBs and policy banks have published annual reports, including NPLs, according to the new loan classification standards. Banks have made greater use of international expertise for financial and operational audits to improve internal operations. 33. Nevertheless, much remains to be done to strengthen the banking sector. Despite the financial support for bank restructuring already provided (totaling about 20 percent of GDP), the financial position of the SCBs continues to be very weak: profitability is 10~;~~ substantial NPLs remain in the banking system;23 and capital adequacy needs substantial 21 For background on the creation of the AMCs and their initial operations, see SM/OO/150, 7/6/00, paragraphs 3 l-34 and Box 6. 22 Average profitability of SCBs in 2000 was zero. 23 The average NPL ratio was officially estimated at 25 percent prior to the transfer of NPLs to the AMCs. However, the authorities explained that a recent reappraisal of loan portfolios (continued) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- strengthening to meet international standards.24 Moreover, lack of expertise, reliable credit information, and industry and company analysis still seriously constrains banks’ ability to assess credit risk. At the same time, rapid credit growth (including by the weakest SCB) portends a continued flow of bad loans. The regulatory and prudential system is still at an early stage of development. 34. Recent operations of the AMCs are encouraging, although some concerns remain. AMCs have started to implement debt-equity swaps with SOES.~~ Some of the AMCs have begun to resolve bad debts through asset sales, achieving recovery rates in the 30 percent range (although these may involve some of the best-quality assets). Some have also engaged foreign expertise to assist with the evaluation and packaging of these assets for sale, including to foreigners.26 On the downside, there are concerns that the existing regulations do not provide the AMCs with sufficient powers to replace SOE management and restructure SOE operations, limiting their capacity to maximize the value of their claims on the SOEs. In addition, there are various concerns about the legal framework (e.g., creditor protection, transferability of ownership, and repatriation of profits and principal). 35. The staff urged the authorities to accelerate banking reforms. In particular: 0 Bank governance and internal restructuring. Move forcefully to strengthen risk management and internal control (focused especially on the quality of new loans); retrain star, and raise legal, accounting, and transparency standards. The staff welcomed the reliance on external audits and urged expanding this practice as a basis for comprehensive rehabilitation programs. has produced more accurate estimates; thus, even after the NPL transfer, the officially reported average NPL ratio remains at 25 percent. Market estimates remain substantially higher. 24 While the reported capital adequacy ratio of major banks approaches or exceeds the Basle minimum of 8 percent, market estimates show that the capital ratios fall well short of this owing to underprovisioning for (and underestimation of) impaired loans. 25 To qualify for debt-equity swaps, SOEs must be approved by the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) and be considered to have marketable products, advanced technology, and good management expertise. 26 Cinda AMC has recently sold an equity stake in a domestic power company to a foreign entity, the first such transaction between an AMC and a foreign company. Huarong AMC has embarked on a roadshow (with a foreign financial advisor) to sell a portion of its NPLs to international investors. Huarong is also planning to issue asset-backed securities, with a foreign AMC acting as advisor and conducting due diligence.

Move quickly toward international best practice for loan classification, with a clear timetable for meeting strengthened provisioning and capital requirements; continue to strengthen the PBC’s supervisory capacity, including of foreign currency operations; and further adapt the taxation of banks, to avoid excessive taxation and allow tax deductibility of specific provisioning. 27 0 &KS. Strengthen the legal and institutional environment for the AMCs’ efforts to resolve the assets they have taken over. In particular, legal impediments to asset sales should be removed (for example, by allowing equity sales at less than book value and enabling foreign investors to repatriate capital from asset purchases); and the AMCs’ capacity to exercise their ownership and creditor rights should be strengthened (by streamlining government approval procedures; strengthening foreclosure and bankruptcy rules; and increasing the use of foreign expertise in asset disposal). 36. The authorities said they were determined to solve the NPL problem, which they saw as the essence of the structural problems in China’s economic system. They explained that SCBs were in the midst of a major restructuring effort that should result in a decline of NPLs by 2-3 percent a year-they noted that NPLs on new lending were very low-and raise bank profitability. The authorities expected that those efforts, combined with the recent transfer of NPLs to the AMCs and the 1998 recapitalization exercise, could be sufficient to raise capital adequacy to international norms. Several SCBs are preparing to issue subordinated debt (tier II capital) as part of this effort. The authorities pointed to the high depositor confidence, noting that this was key to the financial system’s sustainability while reforms are underway. 37. Even though AMC operations might be still be hamstrung by constraints, the authorities viewed their start as an important change in the environment for SOEs. The authorities expected the AMCs’ efforts to impose additional discipline on the SOEs and debt- equity swaps to be a catalyst for SOE restructuring. Some of the’AMCs had begun work on classifying their SOEs into three groups: (i) companies that are viable with debt restructuring or debt-equity swaps; (ii) companies that might be viable with operational and financial restructuring, particularly by finding strategic (foreign) partners; and (iii) companies that are not viable and need to be liquidated. The authorities, noting international experience, were aware of the importance of rapid disposal of NPLs to avoid the risk of AMCs becoming an “NPL warehouse” and bearing even greater loss. They had started an effort to bring in foreign investor participation in China’s NPL disposition, and agreed that the legal and other 27 At present, the 33 percent profit tax rate and the 7 percent business (turnover) tax impose a significant burden on Chinese banks. In addition, because of inadequate provisioning and income accrual, banks’ profits are overstated, and taxation of such overstated profits further erodes banks’ capital. The effective taxation of banks is estimated at some 65-70 percent of banks’ income. The business tax is being lowered from 8 percent to 5 percent over the next two years-the first step was implemented in January 200 1. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - obstacles should be addressed. They added that working out NPLs through the legal system was a new experience in China, and that the legal system’s capacity to handle such cases needed to be strengthened. 38. While there has been progress in addressing the problems in the smaller financial institutions, the authorities agreed that much remained to be done. Medium- sized banks were permitted to go public in the domestic market as a way to strengthen their capital base. Progress had been made with restructuring the trust and investment companies (TICS) by closing insolvent ones, merging solvent ones, and narrowing their business scope (especially by prohibiting external borrowing and cracking down further on deposit taking, which is illegal). The reform of rural credit cooperatives (RCCs), which had deposits of Y 1.5 trillion (13 percent of total renminbi deposits) at end-2000, had also advanced: the number of RCCs had been reduced significantly (mainly by consolidation at the city and provincial levels), and their supervision was being strengthened. However, RCCs still had a large amount of NPLs that had to be addressed. Credit guarantee institutions (CGIs) have expanded rapidly over the past year as a means to increase lending to SMES.~’ The authorities agreed that CGIs needed close supervision to avoid a buildup of contingent liabilities of local governments, and said they were in the process of creating a central institution to oversee the centrally sponsored CGIs (with other institutions to be overseen at the provincial level). 39. The staff encouraged the authorities to consider positively China’s participation in the IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The authorities said they viewed China’s eventual participation in FSAP as important, and welcomed the stall’s explanations (in a seminar at the PBC) of what the FSAP process entailed. However, their preferred approach remained first to complete a self-assessment of the soundness of the financial system, followed by participation in FSAP at the appropriate time. They would consider the staffs suggestion for an early technical assistance mission to help clarify the data requirements and discuss the precise modalities for FSAP. SOE reform 40. SOE performance improved further in 2000 (Table 7). Against the background of the authorities’ objective to revitalize the large- and medium-sized SOEs by end-2000, aggregate profits rose 135 percent in 2000, to Y 240 billion (about 1 percent of gross SOE output). Although a sizable portion (estimated by the staff at some 75 percent) of last year’s increase in profits reflected outside factors including higher oil prices and lower interest 28 By end-2000,203 CGIs had been established in 30 provinces under a pilot program sponsored by the SETC. They are financed by local governments and have extended some Y 7 billion in mainly short-term working capital loans. In addition, a large number of CGIs have been established outside the formal pilot program (mainly by local SMEs pooling resources to start guarantee funds).

There has also been a decline in inventory accumulation (see Chart 1). 41. This progress notwithstanding, deep-rooted problems remained in China’s SOE sector. Using available balance sheet data, staff analysis suggests that about one-third of listed companies were unable to generate sufficient earnings to cover interest payments (see Box 3). Enterprise management and operational efficiency have remained weak, outside governance limited, excess labor still high (up to one-third of the current SOE labor force), and exit channels for poorly-performing SOEs limited. 42. The authorities emphasized the wide range of SOE reforms underway. The basic strategy remained to “commercialize” the large enterprises (by introducing the shareholding and modem management systems) and to “release” the smaller ones (essentially to privatize them); to increase competition (including further opening of a range of sectors under China’s WTO commitments); and to lay off redundant workers supported by an improved social safety net. The following reform priorities stand out: l Accelerating the establishment of “modern enterprise systems” in medium- and large-sized enterprises. This involves implementing the shareholding system (with independent boards of directors and supervisors and a gradually more diversified ownership base); separating government tinctions from enterprise management; and improving incentive and internal control mechanisms. Survey results suggested that 70-80 percent of medium- and large-sized SOEs had introduced at least parts of the new system. l The staff emphasized the importance of tightening the budget constraint for SOEs (hence the importance of commercializing SCBs’ lending decisions) and allowing AMCs’ effective exercise of ownership rights. The authorities agreed, noting that the AMCs formally had the same rights as other owners, although in practice their influence remained constrained by other government agencies’ and local governments’ decision-making powers (especially in the large SOEs). 0 Completing the ownership transformation of small SOEs. The authorities explained that about two-thirds of the small 63,500 SOEs at end-1996 had been transformed (including through conversion to joint stock companies; merger; sale or lease to private investors; and bankruptcy). Social safety net and distributional issues 43. Managing the social pressures of SOE reform remains high on the authorities’ agenda. Progress has continued with divesting enterprises’ responsibility for social services. The authorities explained that progress in this area depended mainly on local governments’ financial capacity-it was well advanced in the wealthier coastal provinces, but less so in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - I Box 3. China’s Enterprise Sector Risk Profile’ I The balance sheet of China’s enterprise sector remains very weak. In particular, the borrowing from state banks to finance the acquisition of fixed assets has created significant leverage and debt service obligations that are not backed by sufficient earnings potential. While the leverage of China’s industrial SOEs has declined in recent years to levels below those prevailing in the Asian crisis countries, it remains high by international standards. Moreover, leverage and solvency indicators based on reported assets and liabilities are likely understated because of overvaluation of inventories, receivables, and fixed assets (which combined represent about 60 percent of total balance sheet assets).

The profitability of listed enterprises has been falling in recent years. The median real return on assets fell to 4 percent in the first half of 2000 (on an annualized basis) despite the general pickup in economic activity and reported increase in total SOE profits. The operating margin-defined as the difference between sales and the cost of goods sold, as a share of sales-is relatively high compared with other countries in the region. However, margins based on a broader measure of net operating income (i.e., incorporating total operating costs) are considerably lower, at just 4-6 percent of sales in 1998-2000, reflecting the still very high social welfare burden borne by Chinese companies. The liquidity position of China’s listed enterprises is even weaker. Long-term debt (LTD) accounts for only 6-8 percent of the total debt of domestically-listed companies, which is low even by the standards of the Asian crisis countries. The dominant share of short-term debt in total debt puts current liabilities well above liquid assets. Current assets, which include illiquid and overvalued inventories and receivables cover less than one-third of current liabilities. The degree of mismatch would widen further if current assets were adjusted downward for the over-valuation of inventories and receivables or for their illiquidity. Despite the improvement in interest coverage in recent years, about one in three listed companies were unable to generate enough cash flow to meet their interest payments in the first half of 2000. While the average interest coverage ratios of 2-4 are better than in the crisis countries, stress tests suggest that the interest coverage of China’s listed companies is sensitive to adverse changes in the economic environment. A moderate rise in interest rates (200 basis points) and drop in net sales (of 3 percent) could result in 40-60 percent of the debts of all listed ftrms becoming unserviceable. Moreover, in some cases where earnings are seemingly insufficient to cover interest expenses, debt service is made possible by accumulating arrears on other current liabilities such as wages, pensions, and debts to suppliers. ‘The analysis in this box uses firm-level financial data for all domestically-listed companies (nearly 1,100 in Hl 2000) made public pursuant to the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s (CSRC) disclosure requirements.

Given the financing constraint, the process would likely take 5-10 years more to complete. 44. The authorities recognize the importance of pension reform, and have initiated steps to address the issue. Although the cash deficit of the current pay-as-you go system will not rise significantly over the next decade (because of China’s relatively young population), the current system is not viable in the long run-the World Bank has estimated the implicit pension debt at nearly 100 percent of GDP. The authorities intend to replace the current system with a three-tier model along the lines recommended by the World Bank2’ and plan to initiate a pilot project in Liaoning province which has a heavy SOE concentration (the pilot has been delayed due to funding constraints). They have also recently begun to require that 10 percent of the proceeds of all new share offerings by SOEs be used to tind the pension system. The staff emphasized that in addition to the institutional changes currently envisaged, parametric changes are also needed to make the system viable (such as raising the retirement age and/or lowering the replacement ratio). The authorities agreed, but noted that raising the retirement age was not an option currently given the existing heavy labor market pressures. 45. Narrowing rural-urban and regional income disparities has become a major policy concern (Box 4). Rural income growth continues to lag that in urban areas, and growth in the coastal regions remains stronger than in the poorer western and central ones. The decline in farmers’ overall income growth and the gap between poor and higher-income farmers are particularly striking. The authorities’ two-pronged policy response includes the intensified efforts to “Develop the West” (through infrastructure investment, technological upgrading, and training and education) and a comprehensive program to promote agricultural development. The lOti Five-Year Plan has set a goal of 5 percent annual farmers’ income growth, by stabilizing grain prices, promoting higher value-added agricultural activities, supporting TVEs and other nonfarm businesses, and reducing the burden on farmers from the proliferation of illegal fees and taxes. Private sector and capital market development 46. Further development of the nonstate sector remains a major plank in the authorities’ strategy to ensure rapid growth and employment creation. This has become a vitally important and the most dynamic sector of the economy.?’ The authorities explained 2g The first tier would be a social pension; the second a mandatory f?.mded system with individual accounts; and the third, a supplementary (also funded) tier. 3o For example, the largely nonstate SME sector now accounts for 99 percent of the total number of enterprises, 60 percent of gross industrial output and exports, and 75 percent of urban employment.

China’s Rural Economy While rural per capita incomes have risen dramatically over the past two decades, they have fallen further behind urban incomes (see chart). International experience suggests that some widening of income disparities is not unusual in the early stages of development, but the degree of inequality that has emerged and persisted in China is exceptional. The World Bank estimates that China’s Gini coefficient has been well above the international warning line of 0.4 for the past decade. There are very few other examples of such acute rural-urban income inequality among countries with similar per capita levels (World Bank, 2000). Key Urban/Rural Ratios The rural sector has been tapped heavily throughout the reform period to support urban living standards. The urban bias is evident in a number of policies that have tended to constrain rural development over the past 20 years. l Controls on rural-to-urban migration. The household registration (or hukou) system and limited access to urban social services has restricted the legal flow of surplus rural labor+urrently estimated at about 150 million-to urban locations where they could earn higher incomes. l Regressive fucal and financial systems. The World Bank estimates that rural communities have suffered large net outflows through the fiscal system since the mid-1980s, limiting their capacity to provide essential social services (particularly health and education) and invest in basic infrastructure. There have also been outflows through the rural financial institutions which have collected deposits from farmers and rural enterprises without granting them commensurate access to credit, instead channeling funds to banks and SOEs in urban areas. l Rigid controls on cropping patterns and marketing channels. China has aggressively pursued domestic food self-sufficiency throughout the reform period, thereby obligating large numbers of farmers to cultivate relatively low-valued basic grains at the expense of more remunerative cash crops. The extraordinary growth of TVEs early in the reform period initially offset the impact of these policies on rural incomes. However, the conditions that favored this growth-particularly excess demand for mass consumption goods-began to erode in the mid-198Os, and TVEs and the rural sector more generally have been in relative decline ever since. Relative rural incomes rose again for a brief period in the mid-1990s in response to higher grain procurement prices, but resumed their decline in 1997 as a result of overproduction, depressed prices and declining rural industrial employment. Real per capita income growth in rural areas has fallen continuously since then, to just over 2 percent last year, its lowest rate of increase during the reform period. Declining fiscal transfers from the central budget have also prompted local governments to impose increasingly onerous fees and charges (reaching as high as 20 percent of incomes) on farmers in recent years. The sharp slowing of rural income growth and rising social tensions in the countryside in recent years has elevated rural development to the top of the authorities’ policy agenda. Increasing rural incomes is a prime economic policy goal for the lO* Five-Year Development Plan (2001-2005). A number of rural development initiatives have been proposed, including reform of a revamped grain procurement and price support system, enhanced rural financial services, longer land tenures for farmers, agricultural tax reform to ease the financial burden on farmers, increased central fiscal transfers to rural communities, and the creation of more small cities and towns to increase off-farm employment opportunities. China has also committed to eliminating numerous protective trade barriers for agriculture following WTO entry that will add to the difficulties of some farmers in the near term. However, most of these concessions will be introduced gradually, and China’s agriculture sector should over time grow more in line with its comparative advantage, significantly raising the incomes of those who remain on the farm.

Capital market development continues to be a key aspect of the authorities’ efforts to impose greater market discipline on SOEs and improve financial intermediation. Important recent steps included the opening of the B-share market to domestic investor.% efforts to crack down on ti-aud and market manipulation, more stringent disclosure requirements, replacing the quota system for new listings by commercial criteria, and tighter rules for delisting of enterprises. In response to staff concerns about the high valuation of equities, the authorities attributed it partly to increasing investor confidence (including from the above measures). While their aim was to gradually increase the number of listed companies, their prime concern was to strengthen the integrity of capital markets and the quality of listed firms. Although capitalization of the stock market has risen to 55 percent of GDP, only about ?4 of this is tradable, and is concentrated in the hands of relatively few large investors. Therefore, a major correction in the stock market would likely have only a limited direct impact on consumption (although it may also affect confidence more generally). The systemic risks for banks in case of a stock market correction are also likely to be minor, since lending for stock market purchases is forbidden and stocks are not 31 The authorities consider “competitive” sectors as “commercially-viable sectors where private firms can thrive.” 32 In January 2001, companies were required to make greater use of the funds they have earmarked for housing allowances to their staff, with a view to speeding up the process.

Ensure better financial disclosure, accounting standards, and governance of listed companies; Tighten the regulation of insider trading; delist enterprises more aggressively; and raise the quality of listed companies (by allowing foreign-invested and key SOEs to list on the domestic exchange); Strengthen investor rights and insolvency legislation, in particular, by replacing the ineffective bankruptcy law (which covers only SOEs; lacks clear rules for Chapter- 11 -type resolution; and generally provides insufficient protection of creditor rights); and Gradually open up further China’s vast pool of savings to effective intermediation, including by launching a second stock market board (for smaller, more dynamic companies than currently listed on the main board); and facilitating the listing of corporate bonds. While opening the financial account is a long-term goal, the authorities intend to proceed cautiously; they may consider allowing qualified foreign institutional investors to tap the domestic stock market. D. Statistical and Other Issues Although some progress has been made, substantial improvements to China’s statistical base are needed to facilitate analysis and Fund surveillance (Annex II). The staff welcomed recent improvements in data provision to the Fund, especially on the balance of payments and SCB finances. However, there is need for improvement in virtually all areas, and the staff again urged the authorities to address especially the following issues: 0 Provide quarterly real GDP data on an expenditure basis, and more comprehensive labor market and price statistics; 0 Strengthen the fiscal accounts, by including spending associated with domestic bond proceeds on-lent to local governments and official external borrowing; also, data on the social and extra budgetary funds are only provided annually and with a long lag; and 0 Data on the financial account of the balance of payments remain weak, complicating the analysis of external developments. Also, the provision of data to the Fund on 33 There has been, however, some illegal use of loaned funds for stock purchases, and the authorities are focusing on this issue. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - reserves and external debt falls short of the benchmarks established for surveillance purposes. 49. The authorities recognized the need to upgrade China’s economic statistics, pointing to the significant efforts underway. Regarding data provision to the Fund on reserves and external debt, they would consider the new benchmarks, noting the need for technical assistance to help address the gaps in the current data. An interagency working group had been established to consider China’s participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), with the working group’s report to the State Council expected in the near future. China is a bilateral creditor of several Heavily Indebted Poor Countries &PCs). Under China’s African initiative for debt relief announced in 2000, the authorities have deemed 32 countries eligible for debt relief, and have begun implementing the initiative. In June 2001, China agreed with Ethiopia on the cancellation of $123 million in loans to that country contracted over the period 1971-90. v. STAFF h’PRAISAL 51. China’s recent economic performance has been impressive, especially against the background of a weakening global economy. Growth has been robust, the external position is strong, and deflationary pressures have eased. These developments reflect the continued transformation of the Chinese economy, supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Although the external slowdown is expected to dampen growth somewhat in the months ahead, the near-term outlook is favorable with real GDP projected to grow by 7% percent this year. 52. The generally strong macroeconomic situation in China provides a supportive environment to continue with the steadfast implementation of structural reforms. As the authorities are well aware, while short-term vulnerabilities are limited, the medium-term outlook is clouded by the risks of the unfinished reform agenda. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to accelerate reforms to ensure sustained rapid growth and prepare the economy for increased global competition after WTO accession.’ Their reform agenda is well-focused on the SCBs and SOEs, and on managing the social costs of the transition and making sure that the benefits of globalization are broadly shared. 53. The staff continues to view greater exchange rate flexibility as essential to facilitate adjustment to the major structural changes underway and China’s growing integration into the world economy. The present favorable economic situation in China would allow a move fi-om a position of strength. The staff also sees little risk that a gradual move by China would have untoward negative regional effects, as the vulnerabilities of emerging market economies in the region are much lower than during the Asian crisis. The staff welcomes the greater use of the existing trading band during the past year and encourages its Ml use in the period ahead. This initial step should be followed by a gradual widening of the band and its linkage to a basket of currencies. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-31- 54. The staff supports the present stance of fiscal and monetary policies. Fiscal policy appropriately aims at a continued reduction in the budget deficit this year, striking a balance between supporting growth and the medium-term constraints. The staff also welcomes the ongoing efforts to strengthen tax revenue, which are already yielding results. Should revenue continue to exceed budget targets, the bulk of the overrun should be set aside for deficit reduction or to support medium-term reforms such as social safety net and pension reform. The staff advises against further fiscal stimulus measures this year unless growth were to slow sharply. 55. The medium-term fiscal outlook remains a source of vulnerability. While explicit public debt is relatively low, the fiscal outlook is burdened by the losses in the banking system as well as future spending needs for social security, infrastructure, and the environment. The stafftherefore welcomes the authorities’ intention to gradually reduce the budget deficit over the medium term, and encourages their plans for additional revenue measures and further strengthening tax administration. In addition, stabilizing the fiscal outlook will require dealing forcefully with the flow of new bad loans in the banking system, which is a key objective of the ongoing SOE and banking reforms. The staff also urges an early review of the system of fiscal federalism to ensure an appropriate level of transfers to the poorer regions while leaving sufficient flurgible resources at the disposal of the central government. 56. The monetary stance is appropriately accommodative. The recent cuts in onshore U.S. interest rates have eased earlier concerns about the impact of the differential with domestic (renminbi) rates on the balance of payments. The staff encourages further progress with the gradual liberalization of interest rates; although this needs to be phased carefully together with other reforms, the authorities should specify a clear and reasonably ambitious timetable so that banks and investors can prepare for the new business environment. The staff urges close supervision of banks’ foreign currency operations which have increased sharply in recent years, to limit banks’ exposure to the associated currency, liquidity, and credit risks. 57. In the financial sector, rehabilitating the SCBs and creating a strong prudential framework remain the priorities. Strengthened efforts are needed, in particular, to minimize the emergence of new NPLs and to improve the SCBs’ financial position (which needs substantial strengthening even after the 1998 recapitalization and last year’s transfer of NPLs to the AMCs). To this end, further progress is needed in improving banks’ credit analysis, risk management and internal controls; retraining commercial bank stti, improving legal and accounting standards; and better monitoring of the quality of new loans. The staff welcomes the determination and increasing transparency with which the authorities are approaching these issues, and encourages further strengthening of disclosure standards and increasing use of independent external audits of bank portfolios and operations. 58. The staff urges early adoption of international best practice for loan classification, with a firm timetable for meeting strengthened provisioning and capital requirements. The staff welcomes the reduction in the business tax on banks, and advises further reform to avoid excessive taxation of banks and allow tax deductibility of specific Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - loan-loss provisions. The PBC is encouraged to continue developing its supervisory capacity, including of banks’ foreign-currency operations. The problem in the rural credit cooperatives needs to be contained through intensified supervision and exit of insolvent institutions. 59. The staff encourages China’s early participation in the FSAP to take stock of the impact of ongoing financial sector reforms and identify both the vulnerabilities and the priorities for future development. 60. The staff welcomes the start of operations of the AMCs and urges that they be given the authority and legal environment needed to fulfill their mission. The AMCs’ prime goal should be rapid and efficient disposal of assets. To maximize the value of the assets entrusted to them, they need to be able to take the necessary decisions to exercise fully their ownership and creditor rights. Approval by relevant government bodies of such decisions should be streamlined, and legal impediments to effective asset management and disposal need to be removed. The staff welcomes the use by some AMCs of foreign expertise in asset disposal, and encourages the wider use of this practice. 61. The staff supports the wide range of SOE reforms underway and encourages their further acceleration as intended by the authorities. The financial condition of the SOE sector remains weak, and greater focus is needed, in particular, on tightening the budget constraint on enterprises-hence the importance of commercializing SCBs’ lending decisions. The efforts to establish modern enterprise management systems are in the right direction, and the staffwelcomes the progress made with transforming ownership in small- and medium-sized enterprises. 62. The ongoing efforts to improve transparency and market fundamentals in the securities markets are welcomed. The staff is encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework, increase the transparency and quality of listed companies, and raise accounting and auditing standards. Looking forward, it will also be important to further open up China’s vast pool of savings to effective intermediation, and to strengthen investors rights and insolvency legislation. 63. Strengthening the social safety net is a key element of successful reforms. The staff welcomes the ongoing efforts to transfer SOEs’ social responsibilities to local and provincial governments. Since lack of funding appears to be a major obstacle in many poor localities, well-targeted central budgetary support may be warranted. The staff also supports the plans for pooling the main social risks at the provincial level, and encourages the plans to enhance pension system funding. These efforts will have to be accompanied by cost- containing measures to ensure the long-term viability of the pension system. Maintaining public support for reforms will also depend on successful efforts to fight corruption and improve governance in all areas of public life. 64. The staff shares the authorities’ concern over the widening regional income disparities. In particular, the lagging growth of rural incomes and the apparently worsening lot of the poorest farmers need urgent attention. The staff therefore supports the authorities’ Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33 - efforts at raising rural incomes, by fostering the development of agriculture and small- and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas. The efforts to “Develop the West”, through investments in infrastructure, training and education, should help narrow the income gap between inland and coastal provinces. 65. Although progress has been made, substantial improvements to China’s statistical base are needed to facilitate analysis and Fund surveillance. The staff has pointed out the key deficiencies in the data, and encourages continued efforts at addressing them. Moreover, although data provision to the Fund has also strengthened somewhat, there remains considerable scope for improvement, including in the areas of reserves and external debt where data provision falls short of the relevant benchmarks. 66. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with China take place on the standard 1Zmonth cycle.

The staff’s medium-term outlook hinges on the pace of structural reforms and, relatedly, the impact of WTO accession (Table I. 1). The weakening momentum in real GDP growth projected for the remainder of 2001 is expected to carry over into 2002, with annual growth expected to moderate further to 7 percent. At least initially, the adverse impact of trade liberalization (WTO accession) on output (particularly in the agricultural, automobile, and heavy industry sectors)-in the form of an assumed increase in the depreciation rate of the capital stock due to accelerated corporate restructuring-would be only partly offset by the expansionary impact of higher FDI. ThereaRer, however, GDP growth is projected to gradually pick up, as the effects of increased competition feed through into efficiency gains (reflected in higher assumed total factor productivity growth). Inflation is expected to remain subdued-in the l-2 percent range-due to declining tariffs and output remaining below potential until 2004. 2. The staff’s scenario assumes sustained fiscal adjustment to reduce and stabilize public debt around 60 percent of GDP. This can be achieved by lowering the state budget deficit by about ‘/2 percent of GDP per year and sharply reducing the flow of new bad loans in the banking system (from an assumed 18 percent of new loan growth in 2001 to 2 percent by 2010). Adjustment in the state budget will have to come mainly from the revenue side, although it will also be necessary to further reallocate expenditure to priority areas. The reduction of NPLs is the goal of the range of reforms underway in the banking and SOE sectors. 3. China’s balance of payments is projected to remain in significant surplus over the medium term. A deterioration in the current account balance through 2004, reflecting higher imports due to trade liberalization, is expected to be more than offset by higher gross FDI inflows-especially in the services sector-and a pickup in portfolio inflows. From 2005, both GDP growth and the current account will benefit from the elimination of quotas administered under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, which is expected to raise China’s share of the world apparel and textile markets. 4. This generally favorable outlook is conditioned on two broad sets of policy assumptions: a The structural reform process is strengthened and carried further. In particular, China is assumed to make progress on SOE and banking sector reform, in line with current plans. This will be particularly important for the maintenance of confidence in the banking system. Moreover, it is assumed that policies to broaden nonstate sector activity-including the development of domestic capital markets and elimination of sector-al entry barriers-will be continued, given this sector’s critical role in employment creation. l WTO accession commitments are honored. The authorities are aware of the challenges posed by WTO accession, and have advanced on many fronts in readying the economy for global competition. The resulting improvement in the domestic Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-42- ANNEX1 business environment and China’s integration into the system of global trading rules should strengthen investor confidence in China, thereby attracting additional FDI and other foreign financing. 5. The stafTs outlook and assumptions are broadly consistent with the authorities’ plans. The recently-tabled lOti Five-Year Plan sets out the key objectives over the 2001-2005 period, including 7 percent average annual growth, continued economic reforms, and rural development. Unlike previous five-year plans, the lOti places welcome emphasis on economic efficiency and the role of market forces in the growth process, rather than detailed quantitative targets as in the past.

The authorities have sought to improve economic statistics with extensive technical assistance from the Fund and other international and bilateral institutions. Nevertheless, weaknesses in the quality of the data, including coverage, frequency and timeliness, remain very serious and continue to hamper the staffs ability to formulate a comprehensive view of macroeconomic developments. The main statistical issues and weaknesses are: Real sector 2. Data on the expenditure components of GDP are not available on a quarterly basis; nor are deflators for the expenditure components-either on a quarterly or annual basis. The data are produced in cumulative form, with minimal revisions of previous data, making it difficult to assess quarterly developments accurately or to make seasonal adjustments. Constant price measures of GDP are also suspect because of deficiencies with the price indices used for deflating and their application. Nevertheless, the National Bureau of Statistics has made a number of improvements to the range and quality of national accounts data, including quarterly estimates of GDP by industry and estimates of GDP by type of expenditure. Further improvements are intended, including the adoption of the 1993 System of National Accounts, further development of income and expenditure data, and improvements to quarterly GDP estimates. However, no dates have been set. As in other countries, rapid economic change, including the expansion of the nonstate sector, present new problems for data compilation. The ability to change the collection of data is restricted by the decentralized nature of the statistical system. Extensive technical assistance has been provided from multilateral and bilateral institutions. 3. Monthly industrial production, retail sales, and fixed investment data also have a shifting base that does not allow a consistent time series. Data revisions tend to be made without publishing the entire revised series. Retail sales and fixed investment data are published only in nominal, not real, terms. 4. Labor market statistics-including employment and wage data-are not comprehensive, and are only available on an annual basis, with considerable lag. 5. Prior to December 2000, the consumer price index was not produced in a time series format, as there were only comparisons between the current month and the previous month, and the current month with the same month of the previous year. For most items, the weights were for the previous year’s expenditures with the other weights being updated each month. Technical assistance missions in September 1991, April 1995, and June 1997 dealt with the concepts and methodology of internationally used index formulae. The authorities have received technical assistance and training on price index methodology under a cooperative program with Statistics Canada. A technical assistance mission in August 1999 reviewed the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - ANNEX II methodology to compile fixed-base price indices in test projects in four provinces and found that only in one province the index was adequate. In January 2001, the NBS began to publish a new fixed base CPI, which more accurately reflects consumer spending patterns (e.g., the weight of services increased, while the weight of food declined). The number of survey items has been expanded to more than 550 from the previous 325. The weights of the major CPI components were provided to the staff during the 2001 Article IV mission. Government finunce 6. Serious data shortcomings continue to hamper fiscal analysis. Budgetary data exclude spending associated with domestic bond proceeds on-lent to local governments and official external borrowing. Also, data on the social and extra budgetary funds are only provided annually and with a long lag. Expenditure classification remains very poor, though this should start to improve next year with the introduction, on a pilot basis, of the new budget classification system. 7. China is a regular reporter of budgetary central government and local government data for publication in the GFS Yearbook. The latest published data are for 1998. No data are provided on expenditure by economic type or government debt. The data also exclude government social security and extrabudgetary operations. Monetary accounts 8. In recent years, improvements have been made in the classification of accounts of the monetary authorities and the banking institutions. However, advances are still needed in the compilation and reporting of monetary data inclusive of foreign-currency-denominated accounts of residents and accounts of the branches of foreign banks. A money and banking statistics mission in June-July, 2000 reviewed these accounts with PBC ofticials and assisted with their classification for inclusion in the monetary data. In addition, the monetary survey lacks sufficient detail with regard to bank claims on the government, which hampers the estimation of the fiscal deficit from the financing side. 9. Detailed breakdowns of bank credit extended by industry (e.g., manufacturing, property, etc.), and by borrower (e.g., the various elements of the state and nonstate sectors) are very important for economic policymakers, and are available in many countries. The staff continues to encourage the authorities to prepare information of this nature for analytical purposes. 10. Due to the restructuring of the banking sector new statistical issues have arisen, such as how to record the transfer of NPLs to the AMCs, and how to classify these companies in the banking survey. The STA mission in June/July 2000 also worked with the authorities to address these issues. Balance of payments 11. Until 1996, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) compiled China’s balance of payments statistics based largely on information collected from various Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-46- ANNEX II government agencies. To compile timely, accurate, and comprehensive balance of payments data, SAFE in January 1996 launched an “international transactions reporting system” (ITRS) which started producing data of sufficient quality within one year. This system utilizes information on foreign exchange transactions conducted by banks to derive data on China’s international transactions. To supplement the ITRS, since early 1997 SAFE has used four periodic surveys to collect data on financial flows pertaining to travel, to gather balance sheet information from financial institutions, and to obtain data on portfolio investment and direct investment. 12. The new system has significantly improved the coverage and timeliness of China’s balance of payments accounts. Currently, the data are compiled in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPMS), and they are disseminated on an annual basis within six months of the close of the reference period. It appears that the authorities are close to being able to publish quarterly estimates of the balance of payments. Within the current account, component detail is available on goods, services, income, and transfers. Data on the financial account are also available with significant component detail for functional categories, but with little sectoral breakdown. The Chinese data are being compiled in U.S. dollars. The authorities have indicated that they have initiated the work on compiling international investment position (IIP) statistics in 2000. However, data collection procedures and the compilation system for IlP statistics need to be improved, and therefore no data have been published so far. 13. The Fund has provided extensive technical assistance for China to improve balance of payments statistics, including through a multisector statistics mission in September 1998. The most recent mission was in April 2000 to review, inter alia, progress made in strengthening the system to derive reliable estimates, reducing the net errors and omissions, producing more timely, higher frequency data, and constructing an international investment position statement. The mission found that the coverage of direct investment transactions remains a particularly problematic issue in the Chinese balance of payments and international investment position statistics. The data received from Ministry of Foreign Trade and Cooperation (MOFTEC) which represent the main data source for these transactions apparently do not cover investments in the form of services, reinvested earnings, and disinvestments. The direct investment survey developed by SAFE on the other hand has not performed sufficiently well to allow the use of any of the data collected. Another issue that has to be addressed urgently by the authorities is to extend verification and auditing programs to reduce the measurement errors and ensure the long-term performance of the ITRS. For this purpose regular training programs for staff in the provincial offices of SAFE were recommended. 14. As part of the work of the Fund Task Force on External Debt and Reserves, a Fund mission visited China during April-May, 1998 to discuss with the authorities the coverage, timeliness, and periodic@ of China’s data on official reserves, reserves-related liabilities, as well as those on other external assets and liabilities, financial derivative activities, and other contingent and potential liabilities. Data on external debt are apparently compiled monthly but published only on an annual basis; these monthly data have not been provided to Fund staff on a regular basis. Despite an ostensibly modest level of external vulnerability, there Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-47- ANNEXlI remains an urgent need to strengthen external debt monitoring and compilation, while introducing additional transparency in data dissemination. On the compilation of external debt data, the mission recommended that better use be made of existing domestic data sources, that domestic data sources (from the banking and corporate sectors) be strengthened, and that full use be made of available external sources (especially BIS and OECD). Data reporting to STA for publications 15. In June 1999, the PBC resumed reporting monthly monetary data and has agreed to their publication in IFS. These improvements in reporting notwithstanding, a number of breaks remain in the series, and comparable historical data are not available. 16. Since 1994, China’s Ministry of Finance (MOF) has regularly reported annual GFS data for publication in the GFS Yearbook. The GFS database currently includes data on the central government budget for 1990-97, and on provincial and local governments for 1995-97. However, the data still exclude social security and most extrabudgetary operations. In GFS terms, the revenue classification does not fully distinguish between revenue and grants, tax and nontax revenue, and current and capital revenue. The presentation of expenditure is by function only and lacks an economic classification. The MOF also reports annual GFS data for publication in IFS. Data, through 1998, relate to revenue, expenditure, and the deficit/surplus of the central, provincial, county-level, and municipal governments’ budgets. These data are provided with substantial delays. The latest published data are estimates for 1999. 17. Reporting of data to STA for IFS has, in the past, tended to be sporadic and with a considerable time lag. Following the introduction of new reporting arrangements, the timeliness of consumer price, industrial production, trade value, and total GDP data in IFS has improved substantially. However, the range of information is relatively limited, with no data published on producer prices, wages, and trade volumes and prices/unit values. Data dissemination to the public 18. The publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin by the PBC has significantly improved the timing and coverage of publicly available data on the monetary accounts and the main real sector indicators. However, public access to data remains considerably below international standards. The monthly statistical publications do not contain many time series nor the disaggregation necessary for analysis. Moreover, several important time series, particularly on the main fiscal variables, are not released in a systematic and timely manner. Extensive annual economic data are available in various statistical yearbooks, but these are published nine months or more after the end of the year.

Projected Obligations to Fund: None VII. Exchange Arrangements: On January 1,1994 the Chinese authorities introduced a unified exchange rate system. Under the new exchange system, domestic enterprises are required to sell their foreign exchange to designated banks and can freely purchase foreign exchange from banks for trade and trade- related transactions with the necessary import documentation. A managed float system was adopted on January 1,1994 under which the PBC intervenes through the purchases and sales of foreign exchange in the interbank market to limit intraday volatility of the exchange rate. On June 5,200l the exchange rate was Y 8.3 per U.S. dollar. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5o- _ , ANNEX III China accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Fund Agreement on December 1,1996. There are repatriation and surrender requirements on proceeds from exports and from invisible transactions and current transfers. As of October 15,1997, qualifying domestic enterprises are allowed to retain 15 percent of the value of their foreign trade (exports plus imports) of the previous year. Qualifying enterprises are foreign trade companies with a trade volume greater than $30 million and with registered capital greater than Y 10 million, and enterprises with foreign trade rights whose volume of trade exceeds $10 million and registered capital exceeds Y 30 million. Foreign-funded enterprises (FFEs) may retain their export earnings provided these earnings do not exceed the maximum amount allowed for a foreign exchange surrender account as prescribed by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE); otherwise, if any, earnings must be sold to authorized banks or to the market. Importers must provide valid proof and commercial bills to obtain foreign exchange. There are no measures currently in force that have been determined to be exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. From the second half of 1998, following substantial problems arising from improperly documented current account transactions and concealed capital flight in a context of mounting anticipations of a devaluation of the national currency, a broad range of new requirements have been implemented to expand the scope of documentation required for most forms of current transactions and require prior verification of the underlying transactions in some instances (e.g., the customs service must certify the value of imports before banks can provide foreign exchange for payment). Regulations were also introduced reducing the scope for domestically-funded entities to conduct business with foreign banks operating in China. Exchange controls continue to apply to most capital transactions. In general, a capital account transaction requires the approval of the SAFE. Equity purchases in China by nonresidents are limited to special shares (“B” shares). Nonresidents are not permitted to issue capital or money market securities in the domestic market. Purchases abroad of capital and money market instruments by residents are restricted to a few financial institutions and enterprises, as are foreign stock and bond issues, which also require prior approval. From the second half of 1998, additional measures have been introduced to prohibit the purchase of foreign exchange for prepayment of foreign debt and expand the range of transactions subject to registration as foreign debt to include, inter alia, payment terms for imports beyond 90 days. An annual foreign borrowing plan sets mandatory ceilings for all medium- and long-term borrowing by government departments and enterprises (except FFEs which are subject to individual limits negotiated in the investment approval process). External borrowing regulations were revised effective January 1, 1998. SAFE will continue to be responsible for the approval and management of external borrowing, pre-approval investigation covers the financial situation of the enterprise, the need for the loan, and whether the terms of the loan are consistent with the use of the proceeds. For short-term borrowing by financial institutions (less than a year), the amount of borrowing is subject to an overall limit determined by SAFE on an annual basis (there are also enterprise-specific limits); financial institutions can Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-51- ANNEX III conduct business within this limit without explicit approval, but must register the borrowing with the SAFE. For medium- and long-term loans, approval will be subject to a limit determined by the State Development and Planning Commission, while the terms of the issue will be examined by SAFE. New regulations on guarantees by residents to nonresidents went into effect in January 1998, with the following key features. First, the concept of guarantees provided by authorized domestic institutions has been redefined and clarified. Under the new definition, guarantees consist of collateral and pledges in addition to what were commonly known as guarantees. Second, the approval process has changed: banks do not need approval to issue guarantees, but must register them with SAFE. All other guarantees have to be approved by and registered with SAFE. Third, both domestic and foreign-currency-denominated guarantees are now covered by the regulations. Fourth, the approval process for guarantees has been clarified, and is now based on prospective guarantors’ profits, assets to liabilities, and asset- quality-ratio requirements. China also maintains controls on FDI, although it has generally pursued an “open door” policy toward inward FDI. In the case of outward FDI, foreign exchange is provided after a SAFE review of sources of foreign exchange funds and an assessment of the investment risk involved, approval by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Cooperation (MOFTEC), and registration with SAFE. In the case of inward direct investment, nonresidents can invest in China subject to meeting certain regulations and MOFTEC approval. For environmental, security, and other reasons, inward direct investment in some industries is prohibited. With regard to derivative transactions, domestic financial institutions and domestic firms cannot enter such transactions for speculation. However, transactions designed to hedge interest rate or exchange rate risk are possible. All transactions involving derivative instruments under foreign debt items must be registered with SAFE. Transactions undertaken by FFEs do not need to be registered. With respect to the development of a forward foreign exchange market for the renminbi, the Bank of China has been permitted, as part of a pilot project, to offer forward transactions involving the renminbi, but the market remains small and proof of an underlying current transaction is required for access to forward cover. The longest maturity is four months. VIII. Article IV Consultation: Discussions for the 2000 Article IV consultation took place during May 15-3 1,200O. The staff report (SM/OO/150) was discussed by the Executive Board on July 26,200O (EBM99/80). China is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. Ix.

Over the years, the relationship between China and the World Bank Group has grown into a mature and significant partnership for development. World Bank commitments to China as of June 30,200O totaled about $34.7 billion for 227 projects. About half of these projects are still under implementation, making China’s portfolio by far the largest in the Bank. World Bank-supported projects are found in almost all parts of China and in many sectors of the economy, with infrastructure (transport, energy, industry, urban development) accounting for more than half of the total portfolio and agriculture, social sectors (health, education, social protection), environment and water supply and sanitation comprising the remainder. In Ey 2000, lending totaled $1.7 billion in IBRD loans for eight projects. Given the increased availability of domestic financing-as a result of China’s fiscal stimulus policy-and a shift of the government’s development program to the central and western areas, the focus of the World Bank’s assistance program is now on the poorer and institutionally weaker inland provinces. As a consequence, the amount of lending per project has been scaled back to suit the absorptive capacity of those provinces, leading to a lower lending level compared with previous years. Of the projects approved in Ey 2000, three supported urban environmental improvements in Beijing, Chongqing and Hebei, two benefited rural development, and three assisted infrastructure development in China’s poorer regions. A summary of Bank commitments and disbursement to China is given in Table 1. Details of the sector-al breakdown of past lending can be found in Table 2. Over the next two years, lending is expected to total $2 billion to $3 billion, with support provided to development of health, education, agriculture and infrastructure in the interior provinces, and for urban management and environment largely in the more developed eastern areas. Since China is no longer borrowing IDA funds, the Bank, in collaboration with the government and bilateral partners offering grants, is identifying a mechanism to blend the grant resources with IBRD loans, resulting in more concessional loans for the social sectors and poverty reduction. General agreement with one donor on such an arrangement is expected shortly, and discussions with other partners continue. The current World Bank Group assistance strategy, covering both lending and nonlending activities, is designed to assist China meet its objectives in four key areas of the country’s development agenda: (i) public sector management, including macroeconomic management, fiscal and monetary policy, and related areas of structural reform; (ii) transitions to a market economy, including establishment of the legal, institutional and regulatory framework, tinancial and SOE reform, private sector development, investment in people, and development of supportive infrastructure; (iii) rural development to improve rural incomes and welfare, increase ‘Prepared by World Bank staff.

In addition to financial assistance the provision of nonfinancial services in the form of technical assistance, policy advice, seminars and training is an essential part of the cooperation program. The government has strongly endorsed Bank efforts to make its nonlending activities more responsive to the country’s evolving needs, by having a better balance between detailed studies of issues requiring lengthy technical analysis and quick delivery of briefer policy notes, supplemented by other forms of collaboration like senior-level workshops. Some of our recent or upcoming outputs include policy and technical notes on pension reform, fiscal issues at both the national and sub-national levels, selected financial sector issues, power sector reform, recommendations for a knowledge strategy for China, services sector liberalization, major sector reports on the environment and water management-both critical to the development process, corporate governance, an urban sector assessment, and thematic notes on China’s plan to develop its lagging western regions. Some of the same themes will be explored in the coming fiscal year, with a particular emphasis on development of the lagging regions, the impact of China’s WTO accession on macroeconomic management, sustainable development of infrastructure, and macroeconomic management, including a major economic report. Representation: The People’s Republic of China assumed China’s representation in the World Bank on May 15, 1980. Capital Subscription: China holds 4,480 million shares or 2.85 percent of the total authorized capital of the IBRD. Currently, China is fully subscribed. Technical Assistance: A technical assistance loan to the PBC to enhance the central bank’s supervision, research, and clearing capabilities was approved in FY 1993. A second technical assistance project, approved in the same year, is financing reform-supportive studies and economic research, the strengthening of core agencies responsible for macroeconomic management and local training institutions, and preinvestment support. Technical assistance for economic law reform was approved in FY 1995. Fiscal technical assistance, also approved in FY 1995, supports the implementa- tion of recent fiscal reforms by developing and establishing a new National Tax Administration, and by developing an inter- governmental grants scheme and improved budgetary practices. Assistance in bond market development has been provided recently. In FY 1999, technical assistance projects were approved for reform of accounting, pension and enterprise systems. Further technical assistance support for economic research and preinvestment was also provided in FY 1999.

In October 1997, responsibility for managing the Bank’s total program for China was decentralized to the Beijing office. International Finance Corporation (JFC): IFC commitments held as of December 3 1,200O total about $253 million ’ 1 m oans and $104 million in equity, of which $166 million of the loans and $81 million of the equity are disbursed. This does not include $361 million in loan commitments held for participants, of which $257 million is disbursed. A resident IFC office in Beijing has been in operation since 1992. In July 2000, a joint IFC/World Bank regional office for private sector development was established in Hong Kong SAR, with management of this program decentralized to that office. IFC’s activities in China focus on the following six areas: (i) developing projects with the local private sector and providing technical assistance to small and medium enterprises; (ii) increasing tinancial sector investment, including commercial banking, insurance, funds management and securities; (iii) identifying projects in the interior provinces, with a focus on Shaanxi; (iv) offering limited recourse financing for large projects that bring technology and management know-how to China; (v) supporting restructuring of SOEs and development of sound corporate governance; and (vi) increasing private participation in infrastructure, environmentally-focused industries, and social sectors such as health and education.

These three broad objectives will help maximize employment generation, further eliminate factor market distortions, and address market failures of rapid growth by spreading the benefits of growth more evenly, and minimizing environmental degradation. Since China became a member of the AsDB in 1986,85 public sector loans totaling $10,297.5 million (Table 1) have been approved as of December 31,200O. In addition, AsDB has approved one line of equity for $3 million, four equity investments totaling $44.3 million, thr ee 1 oans of $116.5 million to the private sector without government guarantee, and 352 technical assistance projects amounting to $182.6 million. The 2001 lending program is at $1.2 billion for nine projects. These are: Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes for Sustainable Rural Development ($30 million); Ningxia Shapoutou Water Resources and Irrigation Development ($35 million); Songhua River Basin Flood, Wetlands, and Biodiversity Management ($150 million); Yellow River Flood Management ($150 million); Acid Rain Control and Environment Improvement ($150 million); Shen-Da Power Transmission and Grid Rehabilitation ($100 million); Ganzhou-Longyan Railway (Jiangxi-Fujian) ($200 million); Guangxi Road Development ($150 million); and Shaanxi Roads Development ($250 million). The lending program mix will reflect the recommenda- tion made in the AsDB Poverty Reduction Strategy, which calls for increasing public sector lending to poverty interventions. Three of the 9 projects in the 2001 program, accounting for $380 million or 31 percent of projected lending, are categorized as poverty interventions. In addition, the technical assistance program included 23 firm projects totaling $12.8 million. In line with the government’s priority to stimulate the development of the Western Region through allocating an increased share of government sources and the AsDB’s overarching objective of poverty reduction, the 2001-03 country assistance program will emphasize investment in basic infrastructure and agricultural development in the Western Region and less developed areas in the Central Region. Particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that environmental issues are addressed and that the project beneficiaries include the poor. About 65 percent (by number and 76 percent by amount) of the proposed projects in AsDB’s operational program for 2001-03 will be located in inland provinces as compared with 40 percent during the 1987-96 period. In spite of this strategic shift to the inland provinces, support for projects addressing environment protection, natural resources management and rural/urban poverty reduction in the Coastal Region and relatively developed areas in the Central Region will be continued. ‘Prepared by the staff of the Asian Development Bank.

Three key themes in the 2001-03 TA program are poverty reduction, improved environmental management and improved governance. AsDB will continue to support for the development of the capital markets, the use of equity investments to mobilize international funds for investment in China, and arranging for cofinancing with commercial banks. Overall, China has demonstrated a strong project implementation capability. The good performance reflects the strong sense of project ownership among agencies involved in the design, implementation, and management of projects, as well as the rigorous screening process for development projects, particularly those proposed for external assistance. Loan disbursement and contract award performance is good (Table 2). Of the 85 loan projects approved as of December 3 1,2000,37 are fully disbursed and closed and 48 remained active as of end-2000. The establishment of the China Resident Mission in Beijing on June 16,200O will foster closer interactions with stakeholders, including government officials, NGOs, private sector and other donors, and enhance AsDB’s local knowledge. AsDB’s presence in Beijing will increase development impact and contribute to improving portfolio management and project administration. AsDB is playing a leading role in two ongoing regional programs that include China, the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and the Central Asia Region. Through Yunnan Province, China is an active participant in AsDB-supported regional program to promote economic cooperation in GMS. One project in the transport sector with important subregional linkages, the Southern Yunnan Road Development Project, was approved in 1999. This Project was prepared under a regional technical assistance (RETA No. 5728: Chiang Rai-Kunming Road Improvement). AsDB is also pursuing cooperation in the Central Asian Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China. A series of RETAs are helping the countries identify and prioritize development projects that increase and diversify trade and other economic activities in three sectors: (i) energy, (ii) transport and communications, and (iii) regional payments and trade. Two projects in the transport sector with important subregional linkages include: (i) Kashgar-Torugart Railway Project, and (ii) Rail Crossing Improvements at the Druzba-Ala Pass (Kazakhstan-China Border). In the energy sector, one possible project has been identified: Facilitation of Kyrgyz Electricity Exports to China, which has been studied under RETA No. 5663: Kyrgyz Republic and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Power Development Study. In addition, AsDB launched a new initiative for economic cooperation between China and Mongolia (RETA No. 5969: Strategic Study on Development Options for Economic Cooperation between China and Mongolia). RETA will help the governments of the two countries prioritize investment programs for the RETA area (which covers the eastern part of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China and Mongolia), and identify the most appropriate transportation modes to integrate the local economies with markets elsewhere.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with the People’s Republic of China On July 23, 2001, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with China.’ Background Over two decades of market-oriented reforms have brought visible success and economic transformation to China. The progress made includes large increases in per capita incomes, significant poverty reduction, a substantial rise in nonstate-sector activity, and growing integration into the global economy. Notwithstanding these achievements, a large reform agenda remains. Most importantly, difficult reforms involving the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the financial sector have yet to be accomplished. China’s prospective entry into the WTO has increased the urgency of these reforms. Economic growth gained momentum during 2000, aided by supportive macroeconomic policies and a favorable external environment. As in the previous two years when stimulative policies were adopted to counter the effects of the Asian financial crisis, domestic demand was boosted through increased fiscal spending; in addition, private consumption-proxied by retail sales-staged a recovery buoyed by housing reforms, an increase in civil service salaries, and higher social spending. Export growth accelerated (to 28 percent) as recovery in the region took hold and because of higher VAT rebates. However, imports increased even more quickly (by 35% percent), partly due to the anti-smuggling campaign-which boosted recorded imports-and higher oil prices. Deflationary pressures gradually receded, with the CPI rising by 0.4 percent in 2000. Unemployment pressures remained a concern, with the official Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

On the external side, the current account surplus increased slightly in 2000 (to 1.9 percent of GDP, due to an improvement in the services balance), while the surplus in the financial account narrowed by 1/2 percent of GDP (mainly because of an increase in foreign assets of Chinese banks related to rising foreign currency deposits). Official reserves increased by $10.5 billion, to $170 billion, equivalent to 8 months of imports and over 8 times the level of estimated short-term debt (on a residual-maturity basis). Growth has remained robust in 2001, despite the weakening global environment. Real GDP growth rose to 8.1 percent in the first quarter (year-on-year), reflecting strong fixed investment and retail sales. Consumer prices rose by 0.7 percent, providing further evidence of receding deflationary pressures. Export growth, while slowing, was still 14% percent; import growth was also slowing (to 17l% percent). Indicators through May suggest a continuation of these trends, with robust domestic demand, but slowing export (and import) growth. The overall balance of payments has strengthened further (mainly reflecting higher capital inflows), with official reserves rising to over $180 billion. For 2001 as a whole, GDP growth is projected at 7% percent, reflecting some slowdown in the second half of the year. Consumer prices are projected to increase by around 1 percent, mainly on account of rising services prices. The current account surplus is expected to narrow to about 1 percent of GDP, reflecting a lower trade surplus, while the overall balance of payments is projected to register a surplus of $1520 billion. Progress has continued in addressing the intertwined problems in the financial and SOE sectors, although much remains to be done to complete the reform agenda. In the financial sector, efforts have focused on recapitalizing the state commercial banks (SCBs) and transferring their nonperforming loans to asset management companies (AMCs); improving banks’ internal operations; and strengthening the prudential and regulatory framework. The recapitalization of the SCBs in 1998-amounting to 3% percent of GDP-was followed in 1999 and 2000 by the transfer of nonperforming loans-totaling 15% percent of GDP-to the AMCs. The AMCs have begun to resolve bad debts through asset sales-some with the assistance of foreign expertise-and debt equity swaps. In the SOE sector-where performance improved further in 2000-progress has continued with reducing excess capacity, improving efficiency, and transforming ownership structures (especially for the smaller SOEs). The reform efforts have focused, in particular, on introducing modern enterprise systems, including establishing independent Boards of Directors and Supervisors, separating government functions from enterprise management, and improving incentive and internal control mechanisms.
