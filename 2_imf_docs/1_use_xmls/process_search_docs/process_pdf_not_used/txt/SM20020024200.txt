Abed and Shigeo Kashiwagi July 25,2002 . The 2002 Article IV consultations discussions with Oman were held in Muscat from May 20-June 2,2002. l The staff team consisted of Messrs. Fasano (Head), Elhage, Camot, and Guerami (all MED). l The team had discussions with the Deputy Chairman, the Executive President, Senior Managers of the Central Bank of Oman, the Secretary General of the Ministry of National Economy, and Undersecretaries and Directors of the Ministries of Commerce; Housing, Electricity, and Water; Finance; National Economy; Manpower; Oil and Gas, as well as with representatives from the Capital Market Authority, the Public Authority for Social Insurance, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Muscat Stock Exchange, and several commercial banks. D In concluding the last consultation with Oman on March 26, 2001, Executive Directors had seen further diversification of the economy and job creation for a rapidly growing Omani labor force as the main challenges facing the authorities over the medium term. While endorsing the response to these challenges-including the creation of a more business-friendly environment to attract local and foreign investment-they suggested a further reduction in the tax bias against foreign investment. Directors also stressed the need to strengthen the fiscal position, particularly the non-oil balance, through revenue enhancement and expenditure restraint measures, while channeling more spending toward education and training. D Oman accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and the proposed fourth amendment of the Articles of Agreement. It also maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers or current international transactions. D The authorities intend to issue a Public Information Notice (PIN), as has been the case since 1998, following the conclusion by the Fund’s Executive Board of Oman’s 2002 Article IV consultation discussions. D The principal author of this report was Mr. Fasano.

Rising liquefied natural gas exports (LNG) partially offset the decline in oil revenue, with the external current account surplus narrowing to 12 percent of GDP. The overall fiscal surplus narrowed, as well, to 4 percent of GDP, also reflecting higher government spending, particularly defense. Economic activity continued its recovery during 2001 amid negative inflation. Meanwhile, banks remained well capitalized and provisioned last year, but their net profit declined for the third consecutive year, owing to rising nonperforming loans. 0 Progress has been made in adopting structural reforms to promote growth and employment. The power sector remains at the forefront of the privatization efforts. Steps have also been taken to boost investment, including lifting impediments to foreign direct investment, streamlining business regulations, and improving corporate governance. To increase the employability of Omani nationals, the authorities have continued to rely on a mix of market-based measures, mandatory mechanisms, and supply side policies, particularly education and training. a Oman is well placed for robust growth over the medium term because of diversification efforts underway to expand LNG output, gas-based industries, and tourism activities. Nevertheless, the country’s financial position is likely to weaken in the period ahead, reflecting a projected decline in global oil prices, and rising imports associated with rising investments. Staff Appraisal a The government policies are in the right direction to sustain the growth momentum and increase investors’ confidence. Oman’s greatest challenges remain the diversification of its economy and job creation for a rapidly growing Omani labor force. To support the diversification efforts, a sustainable fiscal position should be maintained by mobilizing non-oil revenue and reducing nonproductive spending. In addition, although progress has been made to broaden the use of indirect monetary instruments, the staff encouraged the authorities to remove the remaining direct controls on personal loan financing, and deepen the government securities market by securitizing the existing stock of bank loans. l Oman’s statistics are broadly satisfactory for surveillance. However, comprehensive data on the country’s total external debt are not compiled, and labor statistics remain scant. Following Oman’s participation in the General Data Dissemination Standard (GDDS), the country’s metadata have already been posted in the Fund’s web page. A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) is scheduled to take place in FY2003. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- 1. BACKGROUNDANDRECENTDEVELOPMENTS 1. Limited oil resources and a young population have heightened the need to diversify the Omani economy.’ To this end, following the discovery of gas resources in the early 199Os, the authorities have put in place an export-oriented development strategy that aims at developing liquefied natural gas (LNG) and heavy, gas-based industries, along with tourism and container port facilities. This strategy-within an open trade regime and liberal capital flows-has already achieved important results in terms of higher non-oil government revenue, LNG exports, and real GDP per capita (see chart below). In addition, domestic gas pipelines that support the industrial development are close to completion. Prudent macroeconomic policy and structural reforms, including privatization, are also an integral part of the development strategy. The authorities responded to the oil windfall gains in 1999 and 2000 mainly by repaying short-term debt and accumulating large resources into the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF), with Oman’s financial position improving significantly in those years.2 Sources: National authorities; and IMF staff estimates. ’ Oman-together with Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates-is a member country of the Cooperation Council of the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC). These countries have recently agreed to deepen their integration by creating a customs union by 2003 and a monetary union by 20 10. A common single external tariff of 5 percent for most products will apply in the customs union, with Oman’s tariffs already at this level. 2 The SGRF was created in 1980 to replace over time dwindling oil revenues and ensure intergenerational economic equity. However, its resources have been frequently used for budget financing, particularly during the 1990s. For further details about the SGRF and the Oil Fund (set up to finance investments in the hydrocarbon sector locally and abroad), see Oman’s staff report for the 2001 Article IV consultation (W/01/87, page 17).

Despite lower crude oil prices, Oman’s overall fiscal and external current account balances remained in surplus in 2001, leading to an additional accumulation of resources into the SGRF. Average Omani oil export prices declined by almost 14 percent, leading to an oil windfall loss equivalent to about 6 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, an increase in LNG exports by US$700 million to about US$1.2 billion partially offset lower crude oil revenue and higher imports of both consumer and capital goods, with the external current account surplus narrowing by 5 percentage points of GDP to 12 percent (Tables 1 and 2; Figure 1). Government revenue declined by about half the oil windfall loss because of rising LNG and investment income revenues. Government spending (including net lending) grew by 2.8 percentage points of GDP in 2001, mainly reflecting higher defense and capital outlays, a payment to Oman Development Bank (ODB), and the country’s contribution to the recapitalization of the regional airline carrier (Table 3; Figure 2).3 As a result, the central government’s overall fiscal surplus narrowed to 4 percent of GDP, while the non-oil/LNG fiscal deficit (defined as non-oil/LNG revenue minus total spending and net lending) widened by 2 percentage points of GDP to nearly 29 percent.4 Meanwhile, following the repayment of LNG and government debt, external debt dropped below 30 percent of GDP at the end of 2001. 3. Economic activity continued its recovery during 2001 amid negative inflation. Real GDP growth increased to more than 7 percent underpinned by rising LNG export volumes (Figure 1). Non-hydrocarbon growth accelerated to 7.5 percent from about 3 percent in 2000, mainly spurred by investment in new power plants and public infrastructure, and higher private consumption. In contrast, crude oil output remained flat, as Oman-an independent oil producer-has supported an OPEC-led effort to stabilize oil prices since end-2000. With Oman operating within a framework of an open trade regime and a pegged exchange rate fixed to the U.S. dollar, inflation remained negative in 2001 because of a further drop in import prices in U.S. dollar terms (Table 1). 4. Net domestic assets growth was strong in 2001, rising by 16 percent. After remaining flat in the previous year, credit to the private sector grew by almost 7 percent by end-2001, owing to higher lending to the manufacturing sector and for personal loans. Moreover, despite an overall fiscal surplus, for portfolio management purposes, the government borrowed domestically by issuing treasury bills to take advantage of low domestic interest rates. The increase in credit to the private sector and government 3 The authorities clarified that military spending, which reached 11.9 percent of GDP in 200 1, seems relatively high by international standards because it includes equipment, wage payments, and social and infrastructure outlays carried out by the armed forces, but not necessarily of a defense nature-no detailed information was available on the breakdown of military spending. 4 To present a more accurate picture of Oman’s public finances, the staffs definition of the central government’s overall fiscal balance includes oil transfers to both the SGRF and Oil Fund. These transfers are excluded from published official fiscal statistics. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- contributed to an acceleration in broad money growth to about 9 percent, even though net foreign assets of the banking system declined by more than 5 percent (Table 4). While central bank international reserves remained stable at about US$2.4 billion last year, equivalent to five months of imports of good imports, commercial banks’ net foreign assets declined, since some banks liquidated foreign asset holdings to reduce their exposure in regional markets. Reflecting the decline in U.S. interest rates and excess domestic liquidity conditions, nominal interest rates on local currency deposits and loans fell further during 2001, but in real terms, they remained relatively stable, particularly loan rates (Table 5). 5. In 2001, banks were well capitalized and provisioned, even though their net profit (after taxes and provisions) declined for the third consecutive year. The average capital adequacy ratio was about 16 percent, exceeding the 12 percent minimum required by the Central Bank of Oman (CBO). Nevertheless, nonperforming loans rose to almost 11 percent of total loans, reflecting mainly the exposure of a large number of banks to one local business group that experienced difficulties, and in a few cases to other markets in the region (Appendix II). In addition, the adoption of International Accounting Standard (fair value accounting, IAS 39) led to stricter provisioning requirements, squeezing most banks’ net profits further last year. 6. Developments during early 2002 showed a positive change in the trend of some economic indicators. The authorities indicated that some banks reported an improvement in net profits in the first quarter. Accordingly, the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) index, which fell to a six-year low by end-2001, increased by 20 percent through end-May 2002. The growth of net domestic assets of the banking system decelerated to about 12 percent by the end of March 2002 from a year earlier, while net foreign assets grew by 14 percent over the same period. Meanwhile, government spending increased by 4 percent in the first quarter of 2002 from a year earlier, owing mainly to higher investment outlays, with the overall budget recording a small surplus, even though average crude oil export volumes and prices declined by 5 percent and nearly 14 percent, respectively, over the same period. II. DISCUSSIONS ON PROSPECTS AND POLICY ISSUES A. Outlook for 2002 and the Medium Term 7. Oman’s 2002 macroeconomic outlook remains positive, despite the expected decline in average Omani crude oil export prices by 6 percent to US$21.60 a barrel (Tables 1 and 5).5 Although aggregate real GDP growth is expected to decelerate to about 3 percent, as a result of projected flat crude oil and LNG production growth, non- hydrocarbon growth will likely be strong at 5 percent, on account of rising investments in gas-based industries (such as fertilizers) and public infrastructure. The external current account is projected to record a surplus of about 5 percent of GDP-albeit significantly lower 5 Global crude oil price forecasts for the period 2002-07 are based on World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections of April 2002.

In contrast, the overall fiscal surplus would only decline slightly to 3 percent of GDP, since lower oil receipts are expected to be partially offset by higher LNG government revenue, and a modest cut in overall spending, particularly defense outlays and net lending (Table 3).6 8. Oman is well placed for continued robust economic growth over the medium term. Amid projected low inflation, average annual non-hydrocarbon real GDP is expected to grow by about 4 percent during the projection period from 2003-07, mainly as a result of ongoing and planned investments in heavy, gas-based industries (such as an aluminum smelter, and petrochemicals), new port facilities, expansion of existing port capacity, and construction of tourist centers. Moreover, following the discovery of new gas reserves, the authorities have decided to expand LNG output and exports from the current output capacity of 6.6 million tons to about 10.5 million tons by 2006 (Table 6). Consequently, investment is likely to reach 20 percent of GDP by 2005 from about 12 percent in 2000-01, with about half accounted for by the private sector. Average annual aggregate real GDP is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent over the medium term, as crude oil output is projected to remain constant at the 2002 level in the period ahead.7 9. Reflecting a projected decline in average crude oil export prices to US$20 a barrel, the country’s financial position is likely to weaken over the medium term. Projected lower oil prices and higher imports are expected to contribute to a small external current account surplus of about 2 percent of GDP a year on average in the period ahead, even though LNG export receipts are expected to almost double by 2006 to about US$l.9 billion (Table 6). Under current policies, Oman is likely to also record small overall fiscal surpluses of about 1.5 percent of GDP a year, while the non-oil fiscal deficit will probably remain stable at about RO 2.1 billion-albeit declining in percent of GDP to about 23 percent by 2007 (Figure 3)-despite the expected cut in defense spending in the coming years (see paragraph 17). The overall fiscal surpluses would mostly be used to pay the scheduled amortization of government external debt, which will in all likelihood be almost paid off by the end of the projection period. The country’s total external debt will likely remain below 30 percent of GDP, despite rising external borrowing associated with higher investment. 6 Staff 2002 fiscal projections assumed a lower than budgeted level in civil current spending because one of its main components, expenditure on goods and services, is generally overestimated in the budget. 7 Crude oil output could be higher than projected because the public petroleum company plans to invest heavily over the medium term to increase its oil recovery rate.

Although government policies are in the right direction to sustain the growth momentum and increase investors’ confidence over the medium term, Oman continues to face important challenges over the medium term. These challenges include fostering private investment (which remains low at less than 10 percent of non-oil private GDP), enhancing fiscal resiliency, and deepening the financial sector to mobilize resources and support the development strategy.’ In addition, though the medium-term growth outlook, particularly of the non-hydrocarbon sector, is positive, the authorities estimate that the economy might not be able to create enough jobs for a rapidly rising Omani labor force.’ Thus, Omanization of the labor force is necessary to avoid an increase in unemployment, unofficially estimated at 8-10 percent of the Omani labor force. In this context, the discussions focused mainly on progress made in adopting policies to boost private investment and expanding job opportunities for nationals, as well as policies to maintain a sustainable fiscal position, and a strong financial sector. Development strategy 11. Oman’s development strategy seeks to promote a balanced and sustainable growth across the country, and develop human resources and an efficient, competitive private sector. Privatization remains at the core of this strategy.‘O The power sector is at the forefront of privatization efforts, with three power plants currently under construction by foreign investors under a build-own-operate basis. Existing government power plants are also being restructured for their future privatization. A draft power sector law that will establish a regulatory body is in its final stages of approval. In addition, the authorities have recently privatized the management of airport services. Other services to be privatized in the near future include the waste water network, water distribution, and postal services. Moreover, the authorities remain committed to the (partial) privatization of the telecommunications company despite the current global downturn in that sector. A new telecommunications law was approved last March, establishing a regulatory body. The government also plans to gradually sell its participation in the few remaining non-hydrocarbon public companies listed in the local stock market. ’ Oman’s broad money supply reached 34 percent of GDP at the end of 2001, compared to more than 45 percent in countries with a similar GDP per capita in the world. 9 According to the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan, the economy will likely create about 109,000 new jobs in the period from 2001 to 2005, with construction, trade, manufacturing, and education and health sectors creating close to 80 percent of such positions. In contrast, the Omani labor force is expected to rise by 129,400 over the same period. lo According to the privatization law, privatization proceeds have to be used to build up assets of the SGRF.

These include lifting impediments to foreign direct investment, streamlining business regulations, and adopting a one-stop investment center. A new draft mining law to attract foreign investment in the sector is awaiting the government’s approval. The development of an information technology zone is also under way. Further progress has also been made to create a level playing field between foreign and local companies. In this context, the staff welcomed the recent decision made to tax locally incorporated foreign and Omani companies equally at a flat rate of 12 percent beginning next year. The authorities were also encouraged to remove the remaining tax bias against branches of foreign companies, which are still subject to a maximum tax rate of 30 percent. 13. Following the country’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) at end-2000, the ongoing liberalization of services is also expected to encourage investment. Oman has raised the ceiling of foreign participation in service companies from 49 percent to 70 percent in 200 1, and allowed wholly foreign-owned companies in insurance, banking, telecommunication, and computer-related services. In addition, legislation has been revised to bring it in line with the provisions of the WTO agreement, including the protection of intellectual property rights, and copyrights and trade marks, as well as the lifting of bans and quotas on agricultural products. Oman has also accelerated the establishment of bilateral free trade agreements with other member countries of the Arab League. The authorities indicated that the industrial incentive system in place, including the soft loan program to support local private sector development, is currently under revision with the objective to improve its efficiency. Moreover, although the country’s business climate is already quite liberal, the authorities have decided to launch a free trade zone around the Salalah container port to develop a regional distribution center. Among key incentives granted to companies in the free zone are no corporate taxes, and low rental and utilities charges. The authorities expect the spillover effects of the free zone on employment and economic activity to be substantial in the coming years. Nonetheless, the staff pointed out that these incentives seem too generous, as they weaken non-oil revenue, noting that, generally, what matters most to investors is a country’s underlying economic, legal, and regulatory environments. Oman should, therefore, remain focused on continuing to improve, in particular, the business environment to boost investment. 14. Improvement in corporate governance continues to receive top priority to boost investors’ confidence. A Capital Market Authority (CMA) approved code of corporate governance will be issued later this year, while transparency regulations are already strictly enforced.’ ’ The new draft company law will also include new requirements to improve corporate governance. Earlier this year, the CBO issued a circular concerning corporate governance of banking and financial institutions, setting forth the principles of demarcation between the role, responsibility, and accountability of board of directors and that of management in these institutions. ‘t In the past few months, the CMA downgraded 34 listed companies to the over-the-counter market for failing to disclose financial information.

The sharp increase in spending in nominal terms over the past two years-though after almost a decade of no growth-has left no room for further increases, without taking the non-oil/LNG fiscal deficit completely out of line with Oman’s long-term income from its oil and gas wealth (or permanent income).12 Moreover, despite the expected increase in LNG revenue, the fiscal position is likely to remain vulnerable to oil price fluctuations over the medium term (Table 6).13 In fact, if oil export prices fall by just U.S. dollar below the current average medium-term projection of about US$20 a barrel, the overall fiscal balance would move back into a deficit.14 Thus, the authorities are faced with very little margin for maneuver in the face of external shocks. In this context, the staff stressed that fiscal policy should be cast in a medium-term framework, so that the sustainability of the fiscal stance can be periodically assessed. 16. The staff encouraged the authorities to broaden the revenue base in order to reduce the budget’s vulnerability to oil price shocks. A modern tax system based on a range of taxes on income and consumption should gradually replace and broaden existing sources of non-oil revenue, particularly fees and charges. In the meantime, while the institutional framework to adopt this system is being put in place, revenue could be raised by increasing water and electricity tariffs to cost recovery levels, eliminating customs duty exemptions and tax holidays, and introducing a sales tax on luxury items-these measures could boost revenue by at least 2 percent of GDP over the medium term. The authorities agreed with the need to broaden the revenue base; in fact, they have recently requested Fund technical assistance to adopt a value-added tax. They emphasized, however, that adopting new taxes should be part of a coordinated effort among GCC countries, given their open borders and imminent adoption of a customs union by early next year, to avoid unfair competition. In this context, they highlighted that Oman is the only GCC country where locally incorporated companies are subject to corporate income taxes. Moreover, the l2 Under the reasonable assumption of maintaining the country’s total oil and gas wealth constant in real terms over time, and taken into account proven current oil and gas reserves, rising LNG output and exports, and a long-run world crude oil price ranging from US$18- 20 a barrel-the authorities have assumed a long run price of US$18 a barrel in their current development plan-Oman’s permanent income is currently estimated at about RO 1.97- 2.1 1 billion a year. This compares to a projected non-oil/LNG fiscal deficit of RO 2.09 billion, on average, in the period from 2002-07 under current policies. l3 Although dividends from the LNG project have already started to accrue to the budget, a lo-year tax holiday has been granted to the project. l4 At current production levels, Oman loses about 1.4 percent of GDP in oil receipts for every U.S. dollar decline in the price of a barrel of crude oil.

Government expenditure should be restructured toward health and education, including training, to satisfy the demand of an ever-increasing young population, while restraining overall growth of spending. l5 In this context, the staff welcomed the lower defense spending budgeted in 2002. Moreover, given the need to hire a rising number of civil servants in education and health, the staff recommended containing real wage increases, which have increased rapidly in the past few years. The authorities agreed with the need to restructure expenditure, and are confident that overall spending growth would remain low in the period ahead, as currently projected in the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan. In particular, defense would be cut by about 12 percent by 2005 from its peak in 2001, and the ongoing privatization of government services should contribute to containing the wage bill growth and to restructuring capital spending particularly toward education, including training. In addition, sustained ex-post overall fiscal surpluses, albeit small ones, should lead to a virtuous cycle of lower government debt and interest payments. 18. The staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to consolidate the relatively large number of government pension funds to improve efficiency. The process to merge the existing eight government pension funds into two-one covering military personnel and the other one, civil servants-has started, with progress already being made in devising the framework for the merger, while the legal harmonization between the two-fund regimes is currently under study. In the meantime, the staff stressed that the government should enforce employees’ contribution and regularly pays its own contribution to all funds. It also welcomed the accumulation of resources into the SGRF over the past few years, in line with the fund’s objective of saving for the future generations (Table 1). Financial policies 19. Progress has been made to broaden the use of indirect monetary instruments. The CBO reactivated the issuance of certificate of deposits (CDs), as the use of government securities to manage liquidity remains constrained by the existing prudent limit on total government debt set at RO 1.5 billion-a limit that has been reached for some years. The staff pointed out that despite this limit, the tradable stock of government debt could be increased by securitizing the existing stock of bank loans to the government (currently accounting for about one third of the domestic government debt), and eliminating any central bank budget financing, while removing the ceiling on commercial banks’ holding of government securities. l6 The authorities indicated that to better manage liquidity needs, a l5 In 2001, spending on defense accounted for 33 percent of total expenditure, and on education and health, for 16 percent. l6 The authorities clarified that all government borrowing from the central bank is on a short- term basis, mainly used to manage short-term cash flows, and is limited to 10 percent of budgeted revenue. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- monetary policy unit, with technical assistance from the Fund, is being created at the central bank. This unit should also help improve the coordination between the government cash flow needs and monetary policy. 20. Direct controls on personal loans remain in effect, however. To foster competition among banks, the staff encouraged the authorities to remove the remaining quantitative limits on personal lending (currently set at 40 percent of banks’ portfolio) and related interest rate ceiling (currently set at 12 percent), while, at the same time, banks should improve the use of risk management lending techniques. l7 Current low interest rates and the fact that personal loans in bank portfolio are below the ceiling set by the central bank provide an opportunity to simultaneously eliminate these ceilings without much of a macroeconomic impact. In addition, such a move would put Oman in line with other GCC countries, where no direct controls exist on personal loan financing. The authorities, however, strongly believe that without these ceilings, consumer lending would increase significantly, resulting in lower productive lending and higher imports. Also, they are concerned that interest rates on personal loans would increase sharply, as was the case in 1999 when the ceiling was lifted.” Thus, they indicated that these controls would remain in effect for the time being, but they would be regularly reviewed. 21. The authorities have forcefully addressed the deterioration in banks’ asset quality over the past few years. Although there are no indications that commercial banks have failed to apply any central bank prudential regulations, the CBO requested that banks engage external consultants to determine the reasons behind such deterioration. It has also implemented corrective measures to reduce the risk of over-lending to individuals and/or corporations (Appendix II). In particular, banks are now required to obtain audited financial statements from individuals/corporations that borrow RO 250,000 or more from any bank, or RO 500,000 from the entire banking system. On-line information about nonperforming loans of any individual or corporation has become available from the central bank. In addition, the CBO now requires commercial banks to review their entire credit portfolio quarterly to determine changes in loan loss provisioning, and to closely monitor loans to members of banks’ management. A group of financial sector experts from internationally recognized private firms is currently reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of the sector.” The staff welcomed all these initiatives, and suggested broadening the monitoring of private sector l7 The regulations on personal loan financing have not prevented an increase in the level of individuals’ debt over time. Staff estimates show that the outstanding stock of personal loans has increased from about 30 percent of the compensation to employees in the mid-1990s to close to 50 percent in the past few years. l8 Nevertheless, the CBO maintained the quantitative ceiling on consumer lending at that time. l9 A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) is also scheduled to take place in FY2003.

Exchange rate policy 22. The exchange rate policy in place-based on a long-term stable relationship vis- A-vis the U.S. dollar-has provided a nominal anchor and helped maintained low inflation. Reflecting mainly the effective appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies, the CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by about 2.5 percent in 2001 (Figure 4). However, as a result of Oman’s relatively low inflation, the REER remains the most competitive in the GCC area, with non-oil exports of Omani origin, particularly to other GCC countries, recording strong growth during much of the 1990s. In fact, these exports grew on average about 14 percent a year during the past decade through 2001 to almost US$700 million. The staff highlighted the need to sustain a strong fiscal position and a sound banking system to support the peg. The labor market 23. The government attaches special importance to the Omanization of the labor force and the development and training of Omani nationals at all levels.2* Nevertheless, the challenge is to eliminate the segmentation of the labor force along skills, wages, and sector of employment lines, without impairing the economy’s competitiveness, in particular of the private sector, which is expected to create most of the new jobs in the coming years. To address this challenge, the authorities are relying on a mix of market-based measures (such as fees for the use of expatriate labor), mandatory mechanisms (such as quotas, albeit applied flexibly), and supply side policies (such as education and training). The private sector seems to support this approach. The authorities have also started to focus on the Omanization of specific job professions, rather than on economic sectors, as in the past, by banning employment of expatriates in these professions. In addition, they have announced new incentives to encourage Omanization of the labor force by awarding tenders based on the job opportunities they offer to nationals rather than purely on financial grounds. Other initiatives include the development of an information bank on jobseekers, and improvement in the training curricula in collaboration with the private sector to match training with available jobs. Emphasis is also been put on encouraging self-employment through domestic 2o The authorities do not currently compile data on the private sector’s external debt, which is, however, considered to be relatively small. 21 Since the Omanization program was instituted in the mid-1990s, the share of Omani nationals in the labor force of the public and private sectors has increased by 7 percentage points to 74 percent and 11 percent, respectively.

The staff stressed that the authorities should mainly rely on market-based instruments and supply-side policies to enhance the employability of Omani nationals. It also cautioned the authorities that any government financial assistance to set up small businesses should be targeted carefully to avoid waste. III. STATISTICAL ISSUES 25. Oman’s statistics are broadly satisfactory for surveillance purposes. The staff commended the authorities for their ongoing efforts at improving data quality and dissemination. Following the country’s participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), Oman’s metadata have recently been posted on the Fund’s web page. However, improvements are needed in external debt and labor statistics (see Appendix V). The staff also informed the authorities that Oman is obliged under Article VIII, Section 5 (a) to provide data on its international investment position (IIP). Although Oman only provides partial information on its IIP because it currently lacks the technical capacity to compile these data, the authorities indicated that they are seeking outside long-term technical assistance to collect such information. In the meantime, the staff urged the authorities to implement as much as possible the recommendations on this topic made by the 2001 Fund technical assistance mission on balance of payments statistics.23 The collection of these data could help reduce the large balance of payments errors and omissions, as well as monitor external borrowing by the private sector and foreign direct investment flows. Labor statistics, which remain scant, particularly regarding wages and unemployment, should be improved. Fiscal transparency should be improved, as well. The staff urged the authorities to publish a consolidated position of the general government accounts, including data on the financial transactions of the SGRF, Oil Fund, and public pension funds, as well as to adopt internationally accepted classification of government spending. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 26. The authorities’ balanced, export-oriented development strategy has started to show favorable trends in government revenue, economic growth, and exports. Ongoing and planned investments to expand liquefied natural gas (LNG) output capacity, gas-based industries, and tourism facilities, should help sustain robust economic growth over the medium term. Ongoing efforts at encouraging foreign direct investment and streamlining business regulations should also contribute to enhancing growth prospects. 22 These projects are financed out of the US$O.5 billion human resources development fund established in 200 1. 23 The authorities provide the Fund staff with all available information on government foreign assets and liabilities, which are part of the country’s IIP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- 27. The staff commends the authorities for moving forward on privatizing the power sector and services. It encourages them to eliminate the remaining tax bias against foreign companies, as well. In addition, the staff welcomes the continued emphasis on improving corporate governance to boost investors’ confidence. However, it noted that tax incentives granted to companies in the recently created free trade zone weaken non-oil revenue, and that it would be preferable for Oman to focus on continuing to improve, in particular, the business environment to boost private investment. 28. Maintaining a sustainable fiscal position is paramount to support the development strategy. In particular, the sharp rise in expenditure in nominal terms, particularly defense, in the past few years has left no room for further overall increases, without amplifying the budget’s vulnerability to oil price shocks. Therefore, the authorities are encouraged to broaden the revenue base, and restructure expenditure toward social, training, and education to satisfy the needs of a rising young population. While in the long run Oman should aim at adopting a modem tax system based on a range of taxes on income and consumption, in the meantime, the authorities could increase subsidized water and electricity tariffs, eliminate customs duty exemptions and tax holidays, and introduce a sales tax on luxury items to broaden non-oil revenue. 29. Reducing defense spending over the medium term at a faster pace than planned by the authorities and containing wage bill growth should also contribute to improving the budget structure. In this context, fiscal policy should be cast in a medium-term framework so that the sustainability of the fiscal stance can be periodically assessed by focusing, in particular, on developments in the non-oil/LNG fiscal balance. The staff welcomes the efforts underway to consolidate the relatively large number of government pension funds to improve efficiency, as well as the accumulation of resources into the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF) in line with the fund’s objective of saving for the future generations. 30. Financial intermediation should be deepened further to help mobilize resources and support the development strategy. The staff encourages the authorities to lift the remaining quantitative limits on lending for personal loans and related interest ceilings to foster competition among banks, while relying more on indirect monetary instruments to manage liquidity. The central bank of Oman’s decision to issue its own certificates of deposit is a welcome development. To deepen the market for government securities, the authorities could consider eliminating the current limits on bank holding of government bonds, securitizing the current government debt to banks, and relying on the issuance of government securities as the main source of budget financing, including for short-term cash flow requirements. 31. Despite the continuing decline in their net profit, banks remain well capitalized and provisioned. In this context, the staff commends the authorities for forcefully addressing the deterioration in banks’ asset quality of the past few years by bringing prudential regulation and bank supervision fully in line with internationally accepted standards. Banks, however, should further strengthen their risk-credit assessment, while the central bank should broaden the monitoring of private sector borrowing to include external sources. The staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- welcomes the strengthening of Oman’s anti-money laundering regime resulting from the recent adoption of the anti-money laundering law. 32. The staff continues to endorse the authorities’ commitment to the exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar. Amid strong volume growth of non-hydrocarbon exports in the 1990s the current exchange rate regime has helped maintain low inflation and strengthen confidence. A strong fiscal position and a sound banking system remain crucial elements to support this arrangement, while human capital development and structural reforms should further enhance the economy’s competitiveness and flexibility. 33. In their effort to encourage hiring of Omani nationals in the private sector, the authorities should mainly rely on market-based instruments and supply-side policies. In this context, the staff encourages the authorities to maintain a strong emphasis, in collaboration with the private sector, on improving education and training to match available jobs with skill requirements, as well as promoting self-employment by developing entrepreneurship. At the same time, it cautions the authorities that any government financial assistance to small businesses should be targeted carefully to avoid waste. 34. Data provision to the Fund for the conduct of surveillance remains broadly adequate. Oman’s participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) should help the authorities improve the quality of the country’s statistics and enhance data availability. In this context, based on the recommendations made by the 2001 Fund technical assistance mission on balance of payments statistics, the authorities should start compiling, as much as possible, information on the country’s international investment position (IIP), including on the private sector. The staff encourages the authorities to publish available data on Oman’s external debt. To present a more accurate picture of the fiscal position, the authorities should publish a consolidated position of the general government accounts, including data on the central government and financial transactions of SGRF, Oil Fund, and pension funds administered by the government, as well as adopt internationally accepted classification of government expenditure. 35. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Oman take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

The Omani banking system has experienced seven bank mergers since the early 1990s. The latest one, which took place at the end of 2000, involved the country’s two largest banks (Bank Muscat and Commercial Bank of Oman). As a result, there are currently 15 commercial banks, of which 9 are branches of foreign banks and 6 are locally incorporated. At end-2001, the largest 3 local banks accounted for about 70 percent of total assets, 66 percent of total deposits, and 71 percent of total credit, and had combined assets of RO 2.92 billion (US$7.6 billion).2 Despite the dominance of these few banks, the market is extremely competitive and over banked. The number of branches of commercial banks stood at 324 during 2001, averaging about 7,500 people per branch. Regarding specialized banks, after the merger of the Industrial Bank of Oman with Bank Muscat in 2001, three remain currently in operation3 4 2. Commercial banks’ liabilities continue to be dominated by deposits. At the end of 200 1, deposits accounted for 64 percent of total liabilities. Private sector time deposits accounted for the bulk of total deposits. On the assets side, lending to the private sector accounted for some 74 percent of total assets, with personal loans commanding the majority, at about 34 percent, followed by manufacturing and import trade (13 percent each). Ten percent of total assets are in securities, including government bonds and treasury bills. In terms of growth rates, loans to the service sector experienced the largest category increase (37 percent) in 2001, followed by the manufacturing sector (35 percent).5 ’ This appendix updates changes and developments since the last Article IV consultation (W/01/87), and was prepared by Mr. Elhage. 2 The three banks are Bank Muscat, the National Bank of Oman, and Oman International Bank. 3 The remaining specialized banks are Alliance Housing Bank (private), Oman Housing Bank (public), and Oman Development Bank (public). The last of these finances domestic small and medium size projects through a soft loan program. 4 No changes have taken place in the structure of other financial institutions over the past year. The market capitalization of the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) reached RO 1.77 billion by end-April 2002. There are currently 37 companies listed on the regular market, 46 on the parallel market, and 36 in the third (or over-the-counter) market. There is one corporate bond listed (of Bank Muscat), while no derivatives are traded in the market. 5 The capital market remains dominated by trading in government securities (development bonds and treasury bills).

PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR 3. A number of selected indicators-summarized in Appendix II; Table l-suggest that the banking system in Oman remained in a sound position in 200 1, despite the increase in nonperforming loans. The capital adequacy ratio was in excess of both the Base1 Committee recommended minimum (8 percent) and the Central Bank of Oman’s (CBO) more stringent requirement (12 percent) and nonperforming loans were well provisioned for. Capital adequacy 4. In 200 1, the risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio ranged between 13 percent and 17.3 percent among the five largest commercial banks, and averaged 16 percent for the entire banking system. Asset quality 5. Data on asset quality suggests that the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans increased from 7.5 percent (RO 220 million) in 2000 to 10.6 percent (RO 338.5 million) in 2001 (Appendix II; Table 1). Ninety-two percent of gross profits in 2001 were earmarked as provisions for doubtful debts and investment-related provisions, compared to 33 percent in 1999 and 39 percent in 2000. At end-2001, loan loss provisions, including reserved interest, increased to RO 300.6 million from RO 187.3 million a year earlier, while 88.8 percent of nonperforming loans were provisioned for. Liquidity 6. The loan-to-deposit ratio remained unchanged in 200 1 from the previous year at 116 percent. Liquidity management is complicated by the mismatch between loans and deposits maturities. On average, the maturity of loans to consumers tends to be about 48 months, and deposits less than 12 months. In 2000, banks began issuing three- and four- year certificates of deposit (CDs) in an attempt to reduce their book mismatch. foreign entities stood at RO 353.6 million at end-200 1, of which RO 25 1.5 million was held by residents and RO 102.1 million by non-residents. Of the local portion, commercial banks held RO 126 million. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33 - APPENDIX II Table 1.

Bank profits were negatively affected in 1998-2000 by the slowdown in non- hydrocarbon economic activity, lower real estate prices, and, in particular, the increase in non-performing loans resulting from the crash of the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) in 1998. More recently, the sharp fall in net profits in 2001 mainly reflected the heavy exposure of eight banks to a local business group that experienced difficulties-this group had borrowed about RO 50 million (US$l30 million)-as well as more stringent loan loss requirements set by the adoption of the International Accounting Standards (IAS 39), or the norms of the CBO, whichever is higher. As a result, a significant portion of bank earnings had to be set aside as provisions for doubtful loans and for the impairment of investment in the domestic stock market. While in 2000, only two banks reported small negative net profit before taxation (RO 0.203 million), in 2001, five banks (two local and three foreign) reported negative net profits, totaling RO 18 million. Overall, the average return on equity and assets of banks also dropped significantly in 2001 (Appendix II; Tables 1 and 2). 8. Although there are no indications that banks failed to apply CBO prudential regulations, the CBO requested banks to assess and identify the reasons behind the increase in nonperforming loans, and to report on their findings. The CBO has already implemented some additional measures to improve information sharing among banks and to reduce the risk of lending excessive amounts to individuals and/or corporations. Banks are now required to obtain audited financial statements from individuals and corporations that borrow RO 250,000 or more from any bank or RO 500,000 from the entire banking system. Also, the CBO provides on-line information about nonperforming accounts of individuals and corporations. Under a new central bank directive, bank managers and board members must be removed from their posts if they hold any loan that has been identified as nonperforming by any bank in the country.

Operating expenses as a percentage of gross income declined from 46.7 percent in 2000 to 46.1 percent in 2001. In 2001, staff expenses as a percentage of gross income also fell to 24.5 percent from close to 25 percent in the previous year. Interest rate structure 10. Given the fixed exchange rate system, interest rates in Oman tend to reflect those of the U.S. dollar, with a margin for risk premium, or CBO policy to direct domestic deposits and lending structures and size. Interest rate ceilings were in force until 1993, but now these only exist on personal loan rates. Effective January 2002, the interest rate ceiling on personal loans was reduced to 12 percent a year (previously 13 percent), and the quantitative ceiling was raised to 40 percent from 35 percent of the total credit extended by the bank. In a few cases, the interest rates charged on personal loans are below the ceiling. There are also a number of lottery schemes banks use in order to attract deposits at free or low interest rates. Participation in these schemes gives depositors the chance to win certain items, such as cars, houses, and cash. These schemes distort the interest rate structure by reducing effective deposit rates. 11. The spread between the average lending rate and the average repo rate on treasury bills widened significantly from 4.3 percentage points in 2000 to 6.7 percentage points in 2001 .6 This widening mainly reflected the fact that bank loans have significantly longer maturities than those of treasury bills. The CBO introduced a new rule regarding the repo rate, effective June 2000, when it observed that banks were approaching the central bank more frequently for repo transactions instead of dealing between themselves in the interbank market. This occurrence, of course, led to the impression that the interbank market was not fully utilized and that the CBO was utilized as a first resort for funds. The new rule stated that “the repo rate, which the CBO applies for the purchase of government securities for a maximum period of 28 days, shall be based on the latest average yield of 9 l-day treasury bills plus 75 basis points.” This intervention was aimed at encouraging the banks to resort to the interbank market more frequently when in need of funds. 12. The average interest rate spread between lending and deposit rates in local currency (based on outstanding loans and deposits) remained fairly stable during 1998-2000, at around 4.7 percentage points. However, in the year since March 200 1, the average interest rates spread widened to 6.0 percentage points. This widening also reflected the maturity mismatch in banks balance sheets. Average spreads between 6-month LIBOR deposits and 6 The average repo rate dropped to 2.8 percent in 2001 from 5.8 percent in 2000, whereas the average lending rate declined moderately from 10.1 percent in 2000 to 9.5 percent in 200 1.

In an effort to deepen the debt market and develop a yield curve, in April 2001, 364-day treasury bills were issued. Currently, treasury bills are issued with three different maturities: (i) 91 days; (ii) 182 days; and (iii) 364 days. To ease the excess liquidity conditions in the market and to provide an investment outlet to the banks, the CBO reactivated the issuance of central bank certificates of deposit (CDs). These CDs have maturities of 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days. Table 3.

Foreign exchange exposure 14. Foreign currency exposure of banks is limited to a maximum of 40 percent of a bank’s net worth. Only trade-related exposure is allowed, not speculative exposure. The CBO imposes caps on the extension of credit facilities by banks to nonresidents for operations abroad. Also, CBO regulations limit foreign currency borrowings. Foreign assets of commercial banks declined from 12 percent of total assets in 2000 to 9 percent in 2001. Moreover, the ratio of foreign currency (FCY) deposits to quasi-money declined from 11.9 percent to 10.5 percent over the same period in line with the movements in the interest rate spread between local and foreign currency deposits. The net foreign asset position of commercial banks in Oman has been negative since CBO regulations required the “netting of the due to and the due from” banks abroad. At end-March 2002, this position remained negative at RO 140.2 million-albeit significantly lower than its peak at end-1999 when it reached RO 260.7 million.

The CBO has wide ranging powers to supervise the financial system, and has been quick to adopt international standards in supervision. Transparency of reported figures has benefited from the introduction of IAS 39 (fair value accounting) in 2000, a full year in advance of its mandatory introduction elsewhere. 16. The CBO conducted a self-assessment of the supervisory system and practices in Oman in 2000, in order to evaluate compliance with the Core Principles as recommended by the Base1 committee. Overall, the survey indicated that the banking supervisory framework was in compliance with the Core Principles, but that in certain areas, more work was needed to comply fully with the Principles. For example, the central bank noted certain weaknesses in the areas of explicit capital charge for market risk, supervisory driven quantitative standards on liquidity, interest rate and operational risk, the legal base for the appointment/termination of appointment of external auditors of commercial banks, and relationship with host country supervisors. The CBO has drawn up an action plan, along the lines of the recommendations of the Base1 Committee and various efforts are under way and/or contemplated to ensure full compliance with the Principles. IV. OTHER ISSUES Anti-money laundering law 17. On March 13,2002, Oman enacted an anti-money laundering law. The law became effective after a series of debates and deliberations involving foreign experts trained in the subject of money laundering and other financial and monetary irregularities worldwide. The CBO has provided the IMF with detailed answers to the core and supplementary questionnaire on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. 18. A preliminary analysis of this questionnaire indicated that Oman provisions to criminalize money laundering, provide for the reporting of suspicious transactions, and authorize the confiscation of the proceeds or instruments of money laundering. The responsibility for ensuring compliance with the anti-money laundering measures is divided among a number of agencies. The three financial sector regulators (CBO, Capital Market Authority, and Ministry of Commerce and Industry) are responsible for monitoring compliance with the law. However, there are some issues that need clarification, including the legal definition of financing terrorism. Combating the financing of terrorism 19. In December 200 1, a circular on combating the financing of terrorism was issued. All institutions in Oman were advised that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), in which the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have collective membership, has expanded its mission beyond money laundering and adopted eight special recommendations on terrorist financing. Thus, Oman has taken active steps toward full compliance with the FATF recommendations. In this context, the CBO advised all institutions to ensure the following: Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-38- APPENDIX II l Report transactions, possibly related to terrorism, to the appropriate authorities.

Background 1. The coverage, quality, frequency, and timeliness of Oman’s economic data are adequate and meet the basic requirements for the surveillance, economic analysis, and policy formulation. The authorities regularly publish all data provided to the staff, except confidential information on the State Reserves Fund (SGRF) and the Oil Fund. As a framework for the plan for improvements in statistics, the authorities are participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). The Metadata have already been posted on the IMF’s webpage. National accounts 2. National accounts data are prepared by the Directorate General of Economic Statistics in the Ministry of National Economy (MONE) on the basis of information received from government departments and agencies and annual surveys of private and public establishments. The current national accounts series-available in current and constant 1988 prices-were last revised in 1996. Recent improvements in these data include the publication of quarterly GDP by industry at current prices and annual GDP by expenditure at constant and current prices. The authorities are currently working on improving the compliance of these data with the 1993 SNA by producing a detailed breakdown of national accounts by main sectors, such as households, private businesses, and government sector. Price statistics 3. In May 1999, MONE started a three-year household expenditure survey that will provide a more accurate basis for compiling consumer price indices, household consumption pattern, and the value-added in some sectors, such as agriculture. The survey results would also help improve the accuracy of some of the components of the balance of payments, including foreign labor remittances and tourism. 4. In addition to the monthly consumer price index (CPI), which is currently based on surveys only in the Muscat area, MONE compiles and publishes a number of other price indices, such as the wholesale price index (WPI), the Construction Materials Index (CMI), and the Building Cost Index (BCI). The current CPI was introduced in 1997 using weights based on a 1991 household expenditure survey. Based on the results of the ongoing household survey mentioned above, the authorities intend to introduce in the near future a new CPI that would cover in addition to Muscat, the two largest cities in each of the country’s five regions, as well as rebase it to the year 2000. Moreover, following technical Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - APPENDIX V assistance from the Swedish Statistical Office, the authorities plan to publish a new set of price indices, including those of producer prices and trade. Labor statistics 5. Data on labor statistics remain scant. Regular information on civil service (except defense), public sector enterprise, and private sector employment, including the breakdown between nationals and expatriates, is available. However, no data are available on wages and unemployment. The authorities expect to publish the results of a recent household survey that would provide up-to-date and more accurate information on wages and unemployment. They recently introduced a registration system for jobseekers that would help monitor more closely developments in the labor market. Government finance statistics 6. The authorities provide an analytical presentation of the budget for the consultation process, which includes the accounts of municipalities and the regional administrations. However, the official budget presentation does not cover all the fiscal activities, as it excludes data on the operations of the public and semi-public social security funds, SGRF transactions, as well as those of the Oil Fund. There are also difficulties regarding the coverage of the official budget and reconciliation of its financing with the monetary statistics, resulting in some years in large discrepancies. Recently, however, the CBO and the Ministry of Finance have established a joint committee to reconcile these discrepancies. 7. The budget and its actual performance are published annually with detailed. Actual government statistics are also published in the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. The public is provided with projected fiscal activity of the central government through the 5-year development plans. 8. The authorities provide comprehensive information on the government’s domestic and external debt, including by maturity and debt holders. Monetary and financial statistics 9. Consistent monthly monetary data on the Central Bank, the deposit money banks and other financial institutions are published in the Bulletin ofthe Central Bank, usually with a short lag. Monthly monetary and financial data are reported to STA on regular basis. The Muscat stock market index is provided in the Muscat Securities Market’s (MSM) website on a daily basis. Balance of payments, external debt statistics and official reserve assets 10. Data for most balance of payments entries are reliable. The Central Bank of Oman has recently published balance of payments statistics following the classification of the fifth Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - APPENDIX V edition of the Balance ofPayments Manual (BP&U). However, some items are still not compiled in conformity with BPMS. For instance, imports are still compiled on a c.i.f. basis. Financial accounts transactions, particularly of the private sector, are partial, resulting in some years in large movements in errors and omissions and unclassified capital movements. Owing to the increased importance of the tourism sector, the authorities have recently started to conduct regular surveys on tourism to determine the flows associated with this activity. Information on the country’s external debt available to Fund staff only includes that of the central government, and partial data on the nongovernment external’s debt. No data are currently compiled on the non-bank private sector’s external debt. The authorities do not publish data on Oman’s external debt. Publication of Oman’s international reserves was recently revised in conformity with BPMS. Balance of payments statistics are also published in the IMF’s Balance ofPayments Statistics Yearbook. Oman does not compile data on the country’s international investment position (IIP), though data are made available to Fund staff on the government’s external assets and liabilities. 11. Data on the components of foreign assets of the CBO are published in the monthly bulletin of the central bank, usually with a short lag. These components are: gold, IMF reserve assets, balances with banks abroad, and securities. The foreign liabilities of the CBO are negligible. Data on the State General Reserve Fund are provided to the IMF staff on a quarterly basis.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with Oman On [September 4, 20021, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Oman.’ Background Despite lower global crude oil prices, Oman’s macroeconomic performance remained positive in 2001, leading to an additional accumulation of resources into the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF). An increase in liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports by US$700 million to about US$1.2 billion partially offset lower crude oil revenue and higher imports of both consumer and capital goods, with the external current account surplus narrowing by 5 percentage points of GDP to 12 percent (Table 1). Though rising LNG and investment income revenue also partially offset lower oil government revenue, government spending (including net lending) grew by 2.8 percentage points of GDP in 2001, mainly reflecting higher defense and capital outlays. As a result, the central government’s overall fiscal surplus narrowed to 4 percent of GDP, while the non- oil/LNG fiscal deficit (defined as non-oil/LNG revenue minus total spending and net lending) widened by 2 percentage points of GDP to close to 29 percent. Meanwhile, following the repayment of LNG and government debt, the external debt dropped below 30 percent of GDP at the end of 2001. Economic activity continued its recovery during 2001 amid negative inflation. Real GDP growth increased to more than 7 percent underpinned by rising LNG export volumes. Non- hydrocarbon growth also accelerated to 7.5 percent from about 3 percent in 2000, mainly spurred by investment in new power plants and infrastructure and higher private consumption. In contrast, crude oil output remained flat, as the country-an independent oil producer-has supported an OPEC-led effort to stabilize oil prices since end-2000. With Oman operating within a framework of l Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [September 4, 20021 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

S. dollar, inflation remained negative in 2001, as a result of a further drop in import prices in U.S. dollars. Last year, monetary developments showed a rapid rise in net domestic assets. After remaining flat in 2000, credit to the private sector grew by almost 7 percent by end-2001, mainly owing to higher lending to the manufacturing sector and for personal loans. Moreover, despite an overall fiscal surplus, for portfolio management purposes, the government borrowed domestically by issuing Treasury bills to take advantage of low domestic interest rates. The increase in both credit to the private sector and government contributed to an acceleration in broad money growth to about 9 percent, even though net foreign assets of the banking system declined by more than 5 percent. While central bank international reserves remained stable at about US$2.4 billion last year, equivalent to five months of imports of goods and services, commercial banks net foreign assets declined, as some banks liquidated foreign asset holdings to reduce their exposure in regional markets. Reflecting the decline in U.S. interest rates and excess domestic liquidity conditions, nominal interest rates on local currency deposits and loans fell further during 2001. In 2001, banks remained well capitalized and provisioned, even though their net profit (after taxes and provisions) declined for the third consecutive year. The average capital adequacy ratio was about 16 percent, exceeding the 12 percent minimum required by the Central Bank of Oman (CBO). However, nonperforming loans rose to almost 11 percent of total loans, reflecting mainly the exposure of a large number of banks to one local business group that experienced difficulties, and in a few cases to other markets in the region. Also, the adoption of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 (fair value accounting) led to stricter provisioning requirements, squeezing most banks’ net profits further last year. Structural reforms have continued to support Oman’s development strategy that seeks to promote a balanced and sustainable growth across the country, and develop human resources and an efficient, competitive private sector. The power sector remains at the forefront of privatization efforts, with three plants currently under construction by foreign investors under a build-own-operate basis. The authorities have recently privatized the management of airport services. They have also taken important steps toward making the Omani economy more attractive to investors. These include lifting impediments in most sectors to foreign direct investment, streamlining business regulations, and adopting a one-stop investment center. Following Oman’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) at end-2000, the liberalization of services is underway, and legislation has been revised to bring it in line with the provisions of the WTO agreement. A free trade zone around the Salalah container port has been launched to develop a regional distribution center. Moreover, improvements in corporate governance have continued to receive top priority to boost investors’ confidence. Meanwhile, progress has been made to broaden the use of indirect monetary instruments, with the central bank of Oman reactivating the issuance of certificate of deposits (CDs), but direct controls on personal loans remain in effect. The authorities have continued to rely on a mix of market-based measures, mandatory mechanisms (quotas, and supply side policies (such as education and training) to enhance the employability of Omani nationals. Emphasis is also been put on encouraging self- employment through domestic entrepreneurship, including through the provision of soft loans to young Omanis who want to start small businesses and training in partnership with the private sector.
