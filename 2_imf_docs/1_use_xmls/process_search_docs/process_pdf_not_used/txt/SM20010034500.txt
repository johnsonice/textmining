They emphasised that in the near term a determined effort was needed to alleviate the remaining distortions in the economy, most notably by simplifying the trade and eschange systems and by tliminating price distortions. Directors aiso emphasised the need to strengthen the structure cf the budget by broadening the tax base and prioritization of expenditures, particularly with respect to development projects. Directors also noted the pervasive weaknesses in the Svrian data system. and urged the authorities to give high priority to this issue.

As a result of the recovery in the agriculture sector, the price level declined by 0.6 percent. Wigher oil prices helped sustain increases in budgetary revenue, but these increases were offset by an exceptional rise in the wage bill later in the year and an expansion in public investment. This was reflected in a virtual fiscal balance (deficit of0.3 percent of GDP). Q) Favorable oil prices helped Syria maintain a very strong external position in 2000. OIXcial reserves were built up further, and the free-market exchange rate remained stable against the U.S. dollar. A ‘O-year debt rescheduling agreement was reached with Germany in November 2000. e, In 2001: real GDP is projected to rise by about 3.5 percent, driven mainly by continued growth in agriculture, a modest recovery in manufacturing, and an increase in pubiic investment. The fiscal deficit is projected to reach 3.7 percent of GDP. Despite higher fist;!. deficit, consumer prices are pwjected to increase by only 1 percent owing to the good agricultural crops and food production. Reflecting mainly continued strong oil exports, the externai current account is prqjected to remain in surplus. Prospects for the Medium Term a The outlook for the meditun term will be affected by a number of factors. Growth will be constrained by the limited potential in oil and established agricultural activities. and weak prospects for private investment and exports within the current policy st(ance. However: the balance of payments is not expected to come under pressure. Views of the Authorities al The Syrian authorities agree that measures are needed to stimulate private sector investment and exports and contain the projected rise in the fiscal deficit caused by recent increases in wages and sakaries. They emphasize, however, that the gradual pace of reform followed thus far is more consistent with Syria’s political and social systems than t.he accelerated approach to reform that has been recommended by the Fund’s staff. For the period ahead, the Syrian authorities do not intend to deviate Fom this approach. Q The present stable macroeconomic environment provides an opportune moment to broaden and xceferate the pace of reforms in order to boost private sector investment. productivitql grow~!~ and emy;!oynent creation.

BAOXROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ’ A. Background 1. In the early 199Os, after two decades of economic developments headed by the public sector and involving pervasive government controls, Syria undertook a series of important measures to stimulate private sector activity and liberalize the economy. The most important measures were the following: (i) the opening of new areas of economic activities and provision of stro fiscal incentives to private investors (Law No. 10); (ii) exchange system simplification, with a series of moves toward fewer and more depreciated official exchange rates; (iii) price and foreign trade liberalization; and (iv) increases in administered prices (including agricultural procurement prices). 2. The reform policies, together with an increasing level of oil output, elicited a strong supply response, evidenced by a high rate of economic growth during 1991-95 (annual rate of growth averaged 7.5 percent). Exports recovered strongly and foreign exchange reserves were built up to the equivalent of four months’ imports (Table 1). Also, the private sector made substantial inroads in many areas of economic activities that were previously dominated by the public sector. 3. In the second half of the 199Os, while gradual liberalization of the exchange and trade systems continued,* the reform process lost momentum. Price distortions and structural rigidities were not addressed, with the result that the private sector still faces a heavy regulatory environment, which impedes efficient investment planning and day-to-day operations. The exchange system remains complex (Table 2) and together with the numerous positive import lists3 and complex tariff regime, places a major constraint on private sector investment and gr~wth.~ An additional constraint is the corporate tax system with multiple ‘Syria’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II, respectively. Statistical issues are discussed in Appendix III, and social demographic indicators are shown in Appendix IV. ‘In 199698 the official exchange rates were adjusted closer to the market rate. Also, in 1996-98. a substantia; number of import products were moved from the banned list to the “export proceeds” list, or to the list of products that can be imported freely. 3There are three classes of permitted imports: (i) goods that may be financed Tom any source; (ii) goods that must be financed from export proceeds; and (iii) goods that must be financed Corn workers’ remittances. ‘Syria continues to maintain, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. including administrative allocation of foreign exchange. Syria also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII: (i) prohibition against purchases by private parties of foreign exchange from the banking system for most current international transactions; (ii) muitiple currency practices resulting from divergences between the official exchange rare and the rates applicable to debt service payments under bilateral payments agreements, and to transactions in the export proceeds market; and (iii) a 100 percent advance impon deposit requirement for public sector imports. In addition, S,yria is a net debtor under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with Fund members--the Islamic Republic of Iran, the (continued. I .)

The single state- owned commercial ba.r.k is not capable of channeling significant resources to the private sector, mainly because it is oriented to covering central government and public enterprises’ needs through the planned allocation of credit. Moreover, interes.t rates are set administratively and have been unchanged for some twenty years, although the cornnneicial and four specialized banks have been adjusting fees to raise effective rates. 4. Q the absence of further reforms output growth has decelerated, non-oil exports have stagnated, and foreign direct investment has declined (Figure 1). Traditional sources of growth, including major agricultural activities, are facing market and supply constraints. According to staff estimates, real GDP grow31 averaged about 2.9 percent per year in 1996 2000 (Table 1; and Figure l), a disappointing figure relative to the rapid population growth (2.7 percent) and the earlier performance. The slowing growth also reflected the absence of a well-articulated growth-oriented strategy. The current economic environment, which could be characterized by a cumbersome regulatory system, continuing state controls, and a complicated trade and exchange system, make; it difficult for Syria to compete with other developing countries that have adopted more market- and outward-oriented development strategies. 5. While economic growth has not been strong, the tight fiscal stance since 1996 coupled with tight credit policies succeeded in bringing down inflation to the low digit level (Figure 1). These policies 1 ‘. _ ~!.ibuted to strengthening of the balance of payments, an accumulation of foreig; Lnd a remarkable stability of the free market exchange rate. Also, the authorities h;l.

In addition, food subsidies have been limited to three commodities, and an r,-;:rL,&g number of prohibited imports have been liberalized.

The cahirtet has appwed a set of reform nteasures that deals with curr-eaacy law, tax reform, banking reform, and the regulatory framework.’ Also. steps ha\:e ken t&en to improve Syria’s economic relations with the international community, in particular, the European llnion (HJ) and the Arab countries. 7. Most notably, in April, 2001, a new Itdanking law came into effect, under uhich the :stablishment oi‘private banks would be permitted, either as private joint stock companies or as partnerships between ths governn~ent (with a maximum slake of Z!S percent) and the private sector. A.lso, a bank secrecy law came in effect in April 2001. Cu;~entl:\,. a new Law on Money and Credit and for the Central Bank of Syria (CBS) is awaiting parliament’s approval. The new la1.v would give the CBS a greater degree of independence in formulating and conducting monetary policy and would allow for the devolution of the basic monetary, credit, exchange rate, and prudential supervision functions to the Money and Credit Council (h/ICC) lF,,!-rich would include representatives of the CBS and would be chaired by the Governor of the CBS. Drafi. !a\~ on money laundering and on capital markets are at an advanced stage of preparation. 8. Several measures were recently implemented with a view to improvinmg the o_fficiencq of the trade tax system and reduce the induced distortions. 8 In May 200 1, tariff rates on ail raw materials were reduced from the rates of 7 and 20 percent to the rate of 1 percent (including duty and surcharge) and the exchang,e rates used for customs valuation for these items have been unified at the LS 46.0 per US$l . The ob.jective of this measure is to avoid cases where certain production processes are subject to negative effective protection.” 8, The Harmonized Tariff Classification System, which aligns the tariff classiiication system in Syria with international standcar& became effective on July 1, 200 1. 0 i”igricultural tax and profit tax on exports were elimina:ed in .luiy 2001. 0 The list of prohibiteci imported iterr &s was shortened. including the Iiberaiization of car it~nports, cvhose masjmum tariff rate was la\tered from 100 percent ro 40 percent.

Libya, and Egypt. 2‘0 increase the profitability of private sector exports, the 25 percent surrender requirement for nonagricultural exports is now surrendered at the market rate, which is currently about LS 5 I .O per US$l . Car imports were added to the “export proceeds payment list.” However. only 10 percent of private exports proceeds could be sold for this purpose. 10. In the structural area, the government has recently adopted measures designed to provide investment incentives and facilities for the private and public sectors, cut red tape and bureaucracy, and enhance the credibility of the judiciary. Also, signif-icant progress has been made toward accelerating the project application process. Investment bureau branches were set in each of the country’s 14 provinces with strict time limitations for awarding project licenses. ‘The rent law has been reformed, to establish some balance between landlords and tenants. Economic Ferformance in 2000 1 I. lln 2000, real GDP growth is estimated to have rebounded to 2.5 percent after a decline of2 percent in 1999. Growth was mainiy fueled by a rebound in the agricultur-e sector (7 percent) thus offsetting the decline (6.0 percent) in the industrial sector. The negatix grobvth in the industrial sector resulted from the poor performance of the state-otx;ned public enterprises. which were sti!l hoiding significant inventories. Construction fell by about 2 percent. 12. Consumer prices decliancd further by 0.6 percent in 2000 after a 2.1 percent deciirne iw 1999. The decline reflected mainly about a 2 percent drop in the price of foodstuffs, which accounts for 61 percent of thi consumer price index and a slight appreciation in the free-market exchange rate.

The PSF deiicit declined from 2.8 percent o!‘GDP in 1999 to 2. I perccni of GDP in 2000 due largely to the higher budgetary transfers to the PSF. 14. Statistical issues notwithstanding, broad money increased Iby 19 percent in 2OQM, compared to 13.4 percent in 1999.“’ This increase was &rely driven by net tjreign assets. Their surge by 41.1 percent, partly attributable to higher oil prices, more than offset the 35 percent decrease in net domestic assets (Table 4; and Figure 2j. Credit to the private sector only incressed by 1.7 percent, while credit to public enterprises increased by 4.2 percent. Reflecting the increase in money demand, as real interest rates remained significantly positive, velocity of money and quasi-money declined further. 15. Interest rates remained unchanged in 2000 in nominal terms. How~~~er~ with the decline of domestic prices in 1999-2000, they increased in real terms to reach appreciable If vels. Nominal interest rates, which are between 4 percent and 8 percent for savings and term deposits and 9-13 percent for nonagricultural loans to the private sector, have not changed since 198 1. ’ ’ 16. Tight demand management policies and favorable oil prices helped Syria maintain a strong external position fn 2000. While private exports were slightly below the 1999 level, oil exports increased by 52 percent, reflecting mainly a 69 percent incrc-asc in Syria’s export oil price.” Imports only grew by about 4 percent. As a result, the trade balance registered a surplus of USBl.4 billion (Table 5). The improvement in the trade balance was accompanied by a higher deficit in the net services balance, reflecting main!y an increase in payments to foreign oii and gas companies. The GnanciaI account was in deficit, due mainly to an increase in short and long term debt payments. An overall surpius of about IJSSZ40 miliion enabled the central bank to build up foreign exchange re:eI ves to USX2.3 billion (7.4 months ofmerchandise imports).

In recent years, the free-market exchange rate (in Beirut/Amman) has been stable against the U.S. dollar. During 2000, the average monthly exchange rate in the free market was LS 49.37 per US$I, therefore maintaining a narrow gap of about 6 percent with the official rate (LS 46.5 per US$l). During the first half of 2001, the free market rate varied between LS 47-50 per US$ I; and at end-October, this rate was about LS 5 1.25 per US$l . 18. External competitiveness in Syria is best measured through movements in the real effective free-market rate, since the prices of most private sector traded goods reflect the free-market exchange rate. The cumulative appreciation of this rate during 1995-June 2001 was about 26 percent (Figure 3). This appreciation can be attributed to the inflation differentizl with trading partners (before 1997) and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of Syria’s European trading partners since mid 1996. The appreciaticn indicates some deterioration in the price competitiveness of the Syrian economy vis-a-vis other countries in the region. Syria’s price competitiveness has weakened somewhat vis-a-vis Jordan, Egypt, and to a larger extent Turkey-reflecting the large nominal devaluation of the Turkish lira at end-2000. However, given the significant real effective appreciation of the Lebanese pound, Syria’s competitrveness improved significantly vis-&vis Lebanon, one of Syria’s main trading partners. 19. Syria’s officially acknowledged external debt at end-2000 was US$5.2 billion (equivalent to 28.6 percent of GDP),13 about US$400 million less than that in 1999.‘” The main part of the debt, 81 percent or US$4.2 billion, is owed to official creditors. Of the US$4.2 billion, staff estimates that about 65 percent is owed to bilateral creditors, especially Germany and Japan, 10 percent to multilateral institutions, and 25 percent (mostly short- term) to banks and suppliers. Syria has been pursuing a strategy of reducing its external arrears bilaterally, as it has successfully done with most European countries.‘s ‘30ffkially acknowledged debt excludes ruble debt to the Russian Federation and probably excludes late interest obligations on debt to Paris Club creditors. Information is Ilot available because of an inadequate debt reporting system. Most information on Syrian external debt is not made public, including debt service, amortization. disbursements, and commitments. ‘“Debt due to the Russian Federation (including arrears) at end-1996 was Rub 7, I73 million, US$l88.2 million, and UKf 76 million. “During 199 l-2001, debt settlements were reached with Belgium, Bulgaria (in part). Denmark. France. Germany. Hungary, Iran, The Netherlands. Romania (in part). Spain, Sweden, Switzerland. and the United Kingdom.

In 1999, Syria reached a lo-year debt rescheduling agreement with Iran.‘6 In November 2000, Syria signed a debt rescheduling agreement with Germany, one of its largest credi tars. ” This debt is mostly due to the Former German Democratic Republic. The agreement with Germany paved the way for the release of Euro 72 million from Germany for the resumption of technical and financial cooperation projects. Also, since the debt settlement with Germany. the European Investment Bank has approved two loans totaling Euro 190 million to finance electricity projects. Prospects for 2001 21. Real GDP in 2001 is expected to rise by about 3.5 percent, driven mainly by continued growth in agriculture (7 percent), a modest recovery in manufacturing after the clearing of inventories accumulated since 1999, and an increase in public investment. Consumer pr ices are projected ;o increase by 1 percent owing to the good agricultural crops and food production. The external current account is projected to remain in surplus, at about US$500 million (Figure 4), reflecting mainly continued strong oil exports. The capital and financial account is projected to register a surplus of about US$l60 million. 22. Syria is a relatively closed economy and, as such, the impact on growth in Syria from the September events is expected to be limited. However, given the heavy dependence of Syria on oil exports, it is projected that the recent decline in the international oil prices will have a direct impact on both the fiscal and external sectors.‘* Also, the Syrian economy might be affected by the difficult economic situation in Lebanon, given the strong economic link between the two countries. The recent drop in oil prices is factored into the staffs illustrative medium- term policy scenario shown in the Annex. 23. The overall fiscal deficit is projected to rise to 3.7 percent of GDP (excluding a PSF deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP), due primarily to the following factors: (a) the full year effect on expenditure of the rise in wages and salaries in 2000 (Figure 5); (b) higher public investment; (c) reduced public enterprise surpluses and revenue from the enterprise profit tax due to increases in wages and salaries (given the limited pass-through to administered output prices); (d) projected decline in oil export prices; and (6.) reduction in the rate of severa taxes, including the profit and agricultural tax on exports, the individual income tax, the tariff rate on imported raw materials and the liberalization of trade with GAFTA members. ‘%Jnder this agreement, Syria pays Iran LS 1.4 billion per year, which Iran has agreed to spend in Syria, mainly on charitable organizations. Syria does not pay interest on this debt, and the exchange rate used was LS 28.00 per US$l. . . ’ ‘Under the terms of the agreement, Germany’s (East and West) net claims on Syria have been scheduled for 20 years. with a 5-year grace period. However, for the ex-GDR debt, the interest rate charged was 3.5 percent, whereas. for the West German debt the interest rate charged was 2.65 percent. ‘* The staff-estimates that. for each U.S. dollar drop in the price per barrel of oil, Syria will lose about US$l30 million in export receipts per year.

The rise in the wage bill in 2000 and 2001 is an outeome of two separate measures: (a) the usual biennial wage increase, which took eff&t on January 1,283’30, and resulted in a 9 percent increase in total wages and salaries; and (b) a supplementary increase in pubIic sector wages and salaries by 25 percent. which became effective on September 1, 2000 (the last such wage increase wr?s in 1994). In addition, in July 2001. there was a one-time transfer from the budget to all public sector employees equivalent to 85 percent of one month’s salary. II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 25. The policy discussions centered on how economic growth could be accelerated while maintaining financial stability. Growth levels projected under current poIicies were not commensurate with either Syria’s needs in view of the rapidly growing population, or with its potential. While a number of measures have been recently taken to iiberalize foreign trade and the exchange system and to encourage private sector investment, their impact is dampened by the continued distortions in prices, trade and exchange systems, and the lack of a coherent policy framework. In the absence of significant new policy initiatives and an adoption of a comprehensive reform program, real growth is likely to stabilize at about 3-4 percent per year. Such a growth rate wouId not generate sufficient employment for the growing labor force (3.7 percent per annum) ‘and per capita income would stagnate (see Figure 1). 26. The authorities and the staff agreed that there is a need to further Iiberalize fhe economy, but differed on the pace and depth of reform. The authorities believe that the gradual pace of reform followed thus far is more consistent with Syria’s political and social system than the accelerated and more comprehensive approach to reform that has been recommended by the staff. The staff expressed concern that the incremental reform approach the authorities intend to follow may have neither the critical mass nor the credibility to create an environment conducive for a rebound in private and foreign investment, as wdl as technology transfer. 27. Km the stafps view, to bring Syria back on the high growtb track of the ear8y 1990s and deash the economy’s vast potential, major policy initiatives are sreq~~i~ectl. In particular. the growth strategy would have to shife from traditional growth sources to export-driven growth icd by the pril+gate sector and supported b>. further liberaliza~ion in trade. paymenls. and prices. To this end. the prospect& Association ,?rr‘eement with ths Europeat Union. as nell as trade liberafization with the Ara’b v;orid /.. would provide S!iria with t.he opportunity to greatly expand merchandise exports. 7‘~) achi.c:i :: t/jai &jec~ive, a package of ns~asures W-OL~~C~ md in be implemented ai an car!~- ,mgc.

Most of these measures have been undr:r acti\:c consideration. and essentially represent an extension of reforms started in the ear!>. I WOs. More far reaching structural measures, ink:! tiding public enterprises, civil sen’ice. ‘and rrgulatow reforms that require significant technical preparation and consensus building could bc implemented over the medium-term. A. Fiscal and Pricing Policy 28. The authorities and the staff were concerned that in 2001 and beyond, in the absence of additional fiscal measures, the overall fiscal deficits, including the PSF deficits, may increase to about 5-7 percent of GDP. This concern stems from the fact that the non-oil domestic tax receipts of 10 percent of GDP are well below the ratios in neighboring countries, and that the tax base is highly dependent on the profits and su.rpiuses from public enterprises. The share of the tax revenue as a percentage of GDP continues to fall as a result of the reduction of the import tax burden and the elimination of the csport taxes; these are desirable measures but have not been compensated for. The slow ad-justmcnt of a wide range of taxes imposed at specific rates has eroded the tax base and the surcharges fram petroleum and other “strategic” products continue to decline. reflecting the increase in labor costs of public enterprises in the context of rigid output prices and competitive pressures from the private sector. Current expenditure is expected to rise in the absence of civil service reform and improved targeting of food subsidies and greater price flexibility for public enterprises producing “strategic” commodities. In staffs view, it would be difficult to finance deficits in the range of 5-7 percent of GDP from the domestic banking system without exerting significant pressure on domestic prices and the exchange rate. 29. The authorities and the staff thus agreed that it is important to strengthen the budget structure through a combination of revenue-enhancing measures and expenditure restraint. On the revenue side. the staff recommended: BI The implementation of the generalized sales ta.. to compensate for the reduction in trade and other taxes. This will increase the efficiency and transparency of the tax system and reduce the need for ad hoc tax increases to compensate for revenue shortfalls. The stzff offered Fund technical assistance in the design and implementation of this measure. At a later stage. during 2003. this tax could bc transformed into a value-added tax.

There should also be increased recourse to ad vaiorem as opposed to specific taxes. 0 Subsidies on petroleum products should be initially reduced and later eliminated on most petroIeum products to improve resource allocation. l9 30. Moreover, the staff suggested that over the medium term a comprehensive civil service reform was needed, consisting of selective wage increases that could be implemented together with a reduction in employment once the growth of private sector employment picks up again. Also needed was the gradual reduction of the generalized bread subsidy, which currently benefits mostly higher income groups, by targeting it to poor neighborhoods. A review of the large size and composition of the public investment program is qeeded to ensure that only infrastructure investments, which fall beyond the scope of the private sector, are undertaken. ?I. The authorities felt confident that the necessary measures, in particular, the implementation of the generalized sales tax (as a first step toward a VAT) and the unification of the exchange rates used for import valuation would he implemented in 2002 to reduce the budget deficits in the medium term to the level of recent years (1 S-3.0 percent of GDP, including PSF). B. Exchange and Trade Regimes 32. The authorities noted that their aim continues to be the unification of the official exchange rates at a level close to the market rate and the stability of the market rate thereafter. However, they intend to keep the private and public exchange rate pools separate. In their view, since oil exports will not last forever, private sector imports should be financed from private sector foreign exchange receipts and oil export receipts should be used to finance government and public sector imports {see Box). ‘9The impact of higher electricity prices resulting from reducing subsidies on petroieum products on the poor could be mitigated by setting the first consumption tranche at a low price and charging progressively higher tariff‘s for increased consumption.

The two pools are completely separate. The private sector has no access to the public pool of foreign exchange, and the sector’s majority of transactions occur mainly in an unofficial foreign exchange market located in Beirut and Amman. The CBS does not intervene in th’j market. Thus the exchange rate is determined by the private supply of, and demand for. foreign currency (mostly U.S. dollars). I Sources of foreign currency in the free market. The major sources of foreign currency in the free exchange market are workers’ remittances, mostly from Syrian workers in Lebanon; most export proceeds of the private sector (excluding surrender requirement and retained earnings sold in the export proceeds market); proceeds from personal exports (suitcase exports); private services receipts (especially from tourism); and foreign private investment and other capital inflows (i.e., from accounts held by Syrians abroad). Uses of foreign currency in the free market. The private sector is allowed to finance through the free foreign exchange market most imports (mentioned in specific import lists). In or&r to obtain an import license, the importer has to provide to the CboS proof of availability of foreign exchange (imports of investment goods under Law 10 are not subject to this restriction). Other uses are service payments (especially for private travel) and unrecorded capital outflows. Stability of the free market rate. The Syrian pound has been stable since 199 I versus the U.S. dollar (see Figure 3). Such stability is consistent with estimates by the staff that the aggregate private transactions in foreign currency are broadly balanced. During 1995 to 2000. private imports averaged about I5 percent of GDP while private exports amounted to 6 percent of GDP. However. a surplus in private service transactions (avcraping 5 percent of GDP, mainly due to tourism receipts) and workers’ remittances (3 percent) covered the private trade deficit. 1 -- ---~ Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - 33. The staff stressed that the current strength of the Syrian pound in the free market and its appreciation against the European currencies provide a good opportunity to unify. all official exchange rates and move the new rate closer to the market rate. Such a move will simplify the system and would make it more transparent. Also, the above dual exchange system (private and public pools) will need to evolve into a single market system if Syria is to benefit from the allocative efficiency of a broad foreign exchange market and to allow competition between the private and public sectors. 34. Given the lack of monetary instruments to control a floating exchange rate at this stage, the present pegged system should continue after unification. However, exchange rate adjustments should occur, as necessary, in response to market forces, while taking into account the level of the central bank official reserves, and movements in the real effective free market exchange rate. This exchange rate policy will, of course need to be kept under review both as to the level of the exchange rate and the operations of the system as structural and macroeconomic reforms progress. 35. Overall, money and exchange markets conditions in recent years suggest that the exchange rate in the free market is broadly realistic. However, recent developments in the “export proceeds market”, where the exchange rate for the share of proceeds that could be used to finance car imports (I 0 percent) reached LS 6.5 per US$ 1, - indicate that such stability has been maintained through limiting private sector imports. As Syria liberalizes its trade regime, exchange rate adjustments should occur, as necessary, in response to market forces. 36. The staff recommended that, as a first step toward unifying the exchange rate markeits, the Commercial Bank of Syria (ChoS) should be allowed to sell foreign exchange at the free market rate. Since March 2000 when the posseszion of foreign exchange was legalized, the CboS ha3 been buying foreign e ,hange at the market rate; however, it does not sell foreign exchange at the rates prevailing in neighboring countries. 37. The authorities indicated that they ir %nd to move the offtcial rates closer to the market rate. However, in their view, the prevailing free-market rate (LS 5 1 = USSl) included a premium for unauthorized capital movements and, as such, the new official rate would be somewhat less depreciated than the free market rate.

Whilie welcoming the authorities’ intentions to reform the trade system, the staff suggested that the reform uf the trade regime would saced to bc deepened by reducing irnp:!,‘a restrictions to a single “nc~ative” list. The commodities on the negative list should be reduced, over time, to those prohibited only for security, health, or reli@ous reasons. Also, the authorities should consider the repeal of regulations under which! certain commodities can only be imported through specific means of payments.” C. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform 40. Monetary policy has been directed mainly to meet the credit needs of the public sector within a framework cf administrative credit allocation. Currently. the CBS is under the direction of the Ivlinistry of the Economy and Foreign Trade, and monetary policy is the responsibility of an Economic Committee (EC), comprised of the ministries that are in charge of economic and financial matters, as well as the key economic sectors. Since end- 19?5? credit to the private sector had risen only by about LS 13 billion, equivalent to less than 3 percent of money and quasi-money in 2000. Credit policy continues to be geared to the requirements of the public sector which received more than two-thirds of total bank credit, especially in agriculture. III 2000, about 91 percent of total outstanding credit to pubiic At present. imports are regulated through three fists, which arc as fo!Jows: (i) the “restricted list.” comprising products whose imports remain a monopoly of the public sector; (ii) the “negative list,” encompassing prohibited imports because of security. health. and also to protect domestic industry,; and tile (iii) the “pemmirtcd list.” including goods whose import by the private sector is allowed subject to restrictions on mcttmis of financing. 21 .&II goods imported into Syria are subject to customs duty and “unified” tax. Duty rates range betwcerr i percent to 200 percent and tax rates range between 6 percent to 35 percent. As regards the eschar~;:r: rates rjscd for customs valuation, these are mostly overvatucd rates and apply to imports in various tarif%cate;;!-rics rcgardiess ofrhe eschangc rate at which the comntodiries are actually imported.

The authorities noted that with the passage of the new banking law, Syria has taken the first step toward building a more efficient anti modern backing system. Also that significant support will be needed for the CBS’s efforts to upgrade its capabilities as it develops supervisory policies and tools such as capital and liquidity ratios, lending restrictions, and ether prudential criteria to be observed by banks. Additional resources will also be needed to strengthen the Accounting Department and the Research Department of the CBS. The authorities are aware that these changes to the CBS operations will necessitate the recruitment of highly qualified staff and the adjustment of salaries to improve staff morale and performance. 42. The staff welcomed the opening of banking to the private sector and pointed out that the enviromnent in which public banks have operated unti! recently will change significantly when private banks start operations. Moreover, although most public banks’ lending until now is to public enterprises and therefore carries an implicit government guarantee, the staff erged the authorities to review the soundness of public banks’ portfolios and to develop a strategy to restructure them.23 The staff indicated that the emergence of sound private banks in Syria should be guided by a cautious entry pohcy and a clear exit policy. To assist the authorities in the deveiopment of the banking sector, the IMF is providing a banking supervision advisor and training in banking supervision issues. 43. The liberalization of interest rates is an indispensable complement to allowing private banks in the financial sector, if competition is to be fostered. The staff stressed. that the current period of high positive interest rates in real ter,ns provided a good opportunity to introduce interest rate flexibility without major disruption. Various measures were suggested, such as establishing auctions of govemm?nt paper, available to both public and priva;e sector, and allowing banks some flexibility in setting deposit and lending rates. D. External Debt Issues 44. Syria continues to make significant progress toward regularizing its external debt with major bilateral creditors. The authorities stressed that effor;s were being made to improve Syria‘s international relations and that they were keen to clear. through bilateral negotiations. all outstanding payments arrears and remain current thereafter. They were confiden: that an agreement with the Russian Federation could be reached soon. ” Such a strateg should focus on improvin g the opcrntions and soundness of public bar.ks. and developing 2 workout plan to deal with their nonporforming loans.

Y he Syrian representatives commented that while the government’s strategy is to develop private initiative, the public sector is expected to continue to play au important role in the economy, and that their intention was to continue to improve the performance of public enterprises. The st;lff welcomed this intention as a first step toward a more comprGhensive reform of public enterp:ises, which could be reinforced by detaching the public enterprise sector fi-om the central government’s budget, and making them financially autonomous. In activities where goods and services are delivered by the private sector in an efficient manner and at competitive prices, the staff suggested that the authorities could consider disengaging the pub&c sector from these activities, thereby improving resource allocation and devoting public funds to the provisions of other public services. 46. The staff also pointed to the need to simplify the regulatory framework and make it more transparent so as to attract foreign direct investment and stimulate private sector operations. This would involve revising or replacing a number of laws including the Commercial Code. A review of legislation pertaining to foreign direct investment and market access will also be needed as part of the EU Association Agreement under negotiations. F. Statistical Issues 47. Important shortcomings (Appendix III) in the quality, coverage, and consistency of data make it difficult to monitor developments closely, and constrain analysis and policy formulation. Fiscal and balance of payments data are available with substantial lags and they are difficult to reconcile with the monetary data. While national account statistics have improved, they continue to be weakened by the use of a few controlled prices and a multiple exchange rate system, and are only available with considerable time lags. The national accounts in constant prices have been rebased from 1985 to 1995, a new industry survey has been introduced, and work is continuing on moving to the 1993 SNA methodology. The compilation lag in the provision of monetary data by the central bank and some specialized banks has been shortened considerably, but major inconsistencies with the balance of payments statistics exist, These shortcomings have so far prevented the supply of core data to the Fund on a regular basis. The Syrian representatives acknowledged data deficiencies and indicated that efforts will be made to address them. The mission urged the authorities to join the General Data Dissemination System (CJDDS). which provides a framework for steady improvement in a country’s data system over a long period of time. The Syrian representat. ves indicated that the implementation of this system, while desirable. was very difficult at this stage.

The outlook for the medium term will be negatively impacted by a number of factors. Growth will be constrained by: (i) declining oil production (Figure 6); (ii) water shortages which will limit the capacity to expand irrigated agriculture; and (iii) uncertain prospects for private investment in the absence of major policy changes. Private sector investment and exports are not expected to recover unless confidence is restored through major policy changes. The lack of progress in the Middle East peace process had also contributed to overall iack of confidence. However, the development of natural gas will improve the balance of payments and partly ease the pressure on government revenue resulting from the drop in oil production. Against this background, the staffs illustrative medium-term policy scenario shown in the Annex is based on continued gradual implementation of measures to liberalize the trade and exchange as well as continuation of the current fiscal policy. Under this scenario, the annual average fiscal deficit (including PSF subsidies) during 2001-06 is projected to be in the range of 5-7 percent of GDP, with real growth stabilizing at about 3.540 percent per year. Such a growth rate would not be sufficient to provide employment opportunities for the 150,000-200,000 new entrams to the labor each year. Eiowever, with the coming on-stream of additional gas supplies in 200 1, the external position should not come under pressure. In the staffs opinion, however, higher growth rates could only be attained, if a comprehensive package of credible steps including exchange and trade Jiberalization and tax reform was taken to entice higher private sector investment and exports. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 49. Starting in 1990, Syria undertook a series of measures to open and liberalize the economy and stimulate private sector investmenl. The measures elicited a positive supply response, and contributed to the economy’s good growth performance during 1991-95. In the second half of 1990, while the gradual liberalization of the exchange and trade systems continued, the reform process lost momentum, and a cumbersome regulatory system, together with price distortions, as we11 as a complicated trade and exchange system, continue to constrain private sector activity and weaken the budget outlook. 50. The staff commends the authorities on the structural and demand man nent measures undertaken thus far, which represent a good base on which to build t. ,ure reforms. Given the positive outlook for the balance of payments. the comfortable level of external reserves, the stability in the free market exchange rate, and the low level of irf *ion. there is now a good opportunity to adopt a bolder reform package that removes the m impediments to private sector investment and exports; and strengthens public finances. -I K staff would encourage the authorities to introduce mutually reinforcing measures to restore the economy to a rapid growth path.

In the short run, there is a need to simplify the exchange and trade systems further. Unifying all official exchange rates and moving the new rate closer to the free market rate would simplify the system and would make it more transparent. To deepen the foreign exchange market in Syria, the CboS should be allowed to sell foreign exchange at the free market rate. Eventually, in the staffs view, the private and public pools of foreign exchange markets will need to evolve into a single market system if Syria is to benefit from the allocative efftciency of a broad foreign exchange market and to allow competition between the private and public sectors. 52. Recent developments in the “export proceeds market” indicate that the stability in the free market exchange rate has been partly maintained through trade and exchange restrictions. The authorities are urged to keep the exchange rate policy under review-both regarding the level of the exchange rate and the operations of the system-as structural and macroeconomic reforms progress. 53. The staff would also suggest that import restrictions be reduced to a single “negative” list. The number of commodities on this negative list should be reduced over time to those prohibIted only for security, health, or religious reasons. Also, the authorities should consider the repeal of regulations under which certain commodities can only be imported through specific means of payments. 54. The staff shares the authorities concern that fiscal imbalances might develop over the medium term if no corrective measures are taken. In the staff’s view, a major step to strengthen the structure of the budget would be the introduction of a unified exchange rate for import valuation, accompanied by a reduction and reform in customs tariffs. This should be complemented by broadening the domestic tax base, to increase the tax ratio (relative to GDP) and thus finance structural reforms over the medium term. The main measures that the authorities need to introduce are a sales tax at the manufacturing and import level-leading up to a VAT in the medium term-and income tax reform to reduce exemptions. 55. On the expenditure side, the recent expansion in the wage bill without implementing a civil service reform program and without increases in basie food and energy prices is a cause for concern. The subsidization of bread, sugar, and rice is wasteful and mostly benefits the upper-income groups. It would be advisable to replace these subsidies by targeted social assistance. Also, subsidies on petroleum oroducts should be initially reduced and later eliminated to improve resource allocation ,. ’ provide the budget with revenue. 56. Public enterprises sbould be given greater control over their operafious, including decisions on product pricing and iabor force salaries and management so that they can effectively compete with the private sector. In activities where goods and services are delivered by the private sector in an efficient manner and at competitive prices, thp authorities should consider disengaging the public sector ti-om these activities.

The staff welcomes the passage of the new banking law, which represents the first step toward building a more efficient and modern banking system. In addition. the new Law on Money and Credit and for the Central Bank of Syria, which is pending Parliament’s approval, would enhance the authority of the CBS to conduct monetary policy and establish bank supervision. In the staffs view, public banks may have substantial nonperforming loans that need to be restructured. The soundness of public banks’ portfolios should also be reviewed. 58. In view of the price deflation, the sluggish pace of economic activity, and the fact that interest rates have not changed since 198 1, the staff believes that a modest reduction in interest rates would signal a supportive policy stance and serve as a first move toward a policy of interest rate flexibility. In this connection, the staff would further suggest that the authorities consider setting up a treasury bill auction system. 59. Syria continues to make significant progress toward regularizing its external debt with major bilateral creditors. The mission welcomed the debt rescheduling agreement reached in 2000 with Germany and the authorities’ intention to clear all Syria’s outstanding payments arrears and remain current thereafter. The mission encourages the authorities to settle Syria’s debt with the Russian Federation as soon as possible 60. Significant weaknesses exist in Syria’s statistical base, in terms of coverage, consistency, periodicity, and timeliness, A-rich have hampered the staffs ability to conduct economic analysis and effective surveillance. Efforts to address the weaknesses in Syria’s statistical base must cover a wide range of sectors, including naAna1 accounts, customs data on trade transactions, public finances, monetary accounts, private capital movements, the labor market, and external debt statistics. The authorities are committed to bring about major improvements in these areas. The staff believes that these efforts could be strengthened through participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System. 61. Syria continues to maintain, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, including the administrative allocation of foreign exchange. Syria also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. In the absence of specific measures to eliminate the restrictions and multiple currency practices in a timeiy manner, the staff does not recommend that the Executive Board grant approval for the retention of the exchange practices under Article VIII. The staff urges the authorities to eliminate these restrictions as soon as possible, and to accept obligations of Article VIII. 62.

By mid-l 997 arrears had risen to the equivalent of LJS$526 million. LJnder the terms of the agreement. Syria repaid all of the principal arrears outstanding as of September 1. 1997 in the amount of CJS$270 million, and, starting October 1. 1997. has made monthl!~ payments in the amount of [JS$6.1 million. The monthly payments at this level co\‘~‘r ne\i debt service falling due and payment of interest arrears over a period of five years from October 1, 1997. 2. As of September 30, 2001 the outstanding interest arrears owed IBRD amounted to US$55.4 Million. The amount of outstanding (but not yet due) principal amounted to the equivalent of US$45.2 million, of which the equivalent of US$28.6 million was to IDA and US$16.6 million for IBRD (as of September 30, 2001). 3. Subsequent to the agreement on arrears, the World Bank has begun to provide non- lending services to Syria. The full scope and nature of the assistance program continues to be under discussion with the Syrian authorities. Initial activities included support for the h4inistry of Finance and the Central Bank of. Syria in accounting and the establishment of an estcrnal debt management system in the form of grants from the Institutional Development Fund; planning and implementation grants supporting Year 2000 remediation efforts; the Global Environment Fund biodiversity project; and revi- . s of the trade regime (including export promotion), health. roads, urban water and sanitation. and agricultural irrigation sectors. At the same time. the IFC has begun to identify possible private sector projects for support through IFC equity investments or loans without government guarantee. In December 19?9, the IFC approved its first project in Syria. making a US$l million equity investment in an irrigation technology company that designs and manufactures systems that address the critical problem of water scarcity in the Middle East.

The mission figured that the aggregate estimates of GDP, compiled at current and constant prices by industry of origin and by final use, were based on a substantial database and an appropriate methodology. However, the mission also indicated several shortcomings. The production-based GnP estimates suffered fi-om undercoverage ofactivities, particularly in trade and private ser\:iccs. In response, the authorities introduced a new industrial survey in 1997 which has a large1 sampling of private sector activity. The STA mission also found that the estimates of 5nal expenditures on GDP were incomplete in that household final consumption expenditures were calculated as a residual, and included changes in inventories since the latter wa:; not estimated separately. In response, the authorities have begun to collect dara on inventory changes in the public sector, and are considering whether a survey of inventories in the private sector is feasible. They had planned to use the results of a new household expenditure survey (see below) as a check on their estimates of final consumption expenditure. The other shortcomings identified by the STA mission have not been able to be addressed as yet.. These are that the consumption of fixed capital is estimated as a constant ratio of output. and that net income tlows between residents and nonresidents derived from the balance of payments are unsatisfactory, so that the estimates of saving, investment, and net borrowing from abroad are unreliable. In addition, household final consumption expenditures should be estimated through a commodity flow analysis, and a new capital stock series should be developed. The authorities have been preparing for the conversion of-the national accounts to the methodology outlined in the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA). Two years data have been compiled, and the IXW srrics will be published when 5 years data are available.

Submission of IFS reaI seclor data to SI‘A is irregular. b. Governnaent finance Foreign financing as reported in the budgetary accounts cannot be confirmed b!; the balance of payments accounts. The accounting system of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) does not permit an accurate breakdown between interest and principal payments on domestic arId foreign debt, and debt servicing is reported on a cash rather than an accrual basis. However, during the 200 1 consultation process, the authorities provided the staff with a breakdown of interest and principal payments for the period 1996-2000. There are sizable discrepancies in net credit to the government reported in the monetary survey and the fiscal accounts. The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear, even after making allowance for the Ministry of Finance’s classifying commercial bank credit extended to the Price Stabilization Fund outside the budget. However, they probably include differences in coverage and timing and differences between cash and accrual. Similarly, the Central Bank of Syria (CBS) occasionally assumes the accumulated debt of public enterprises to the banking system through the issuance of government bonds; such operations are not reflected in the fiscal OI monetary accounts. Moreover. coverage includes only some extrabudgetary units and there is a need for reclassification of some tax revenue items to nontax revenues. Syria regularly reports GFS annual data for publication in the G/;;c I’ecrrhook. lio\vcver. the reported data are partial, too aggregated, misclassified (for some revenue component items) and do not include estrabudgetary and social security accounts. No data on financing and debt are provided; there is no breakdown for current and capital expenditure, and lending minus repayments is reported as zero. Syria does not report GFS data for publication in Ji-‘,T. c. Monetary accounts The recent monetary and financial statistics mission from STA that visited Syria during .lulyr l-12, 2001. found that the CBS has made considerable progress in implementing rhe re&mmendation:; of the April 1996 ST.%%4ED technical assistance mission. All sectorizntion. classifkation, and vaiuation errors in the monetary statistics that were identified by the mission have been corrected. Reporting tags also have been reduced significantly. The preliminary balance sheet of the CBS is now available with only a four- month Ing (compared to anywhere betw:een 19 months and 43 months previously), and is estimated bj; the CBS Research Department by draWing on the reports of operational depxtmcnti rust hoiding at constant vaiue entries for w!~ich data arc not availabie.

Since it provides only annual data: the year-end balance sheet data have been taken as estimates i‘or all months in the following yecar, until the next annual balance sheet is available. The mission recommended that the CBS request the Savings Bank to start providing monthly data in cull report form similar to those used by other deposit money banks. The mission also found 0t.n that data for five branches of Cotnmercial Bank of Syria (CBoS) operating in free-zone aress were not included in the consolidated balance sheet data of CBoS provided to the Research Department of CBS for the compilation of monetary survey. The mission recommenJed that the balance sheet for these branches should be included in the monetary survey. Further to new developments being proposed in the banking sector (Law No. 28) allowing private banks to operate in Syria, the mission also recommended that the Banking Supervision and Research Departments should work together in discussion with the staff of the deposit money banks to design new call report forms which will provide adequate data necessary both for banking supervision and monetary statistics compilation purposes. Despite recent improvements in the monetary data, difIicuIty remains with the accounting of foreign exchange reserves, which are booked by the CBS in Syrian pounds, at the exchange rate in effect at the time of the underlying transaction. ‘These underlying transactions have not been made available to the staff‘; consequently there can be no confirmation of the ol’ficinl valuation of Syria’s international reserves. In addition, the discrepancy regarding net foreign assets developments between the monetary survey (MS) and the balance of payments increased significantly in recent years. Additional discrepancy that continues to widen relates to the net claims on the government which continue to decline while the LJVerdl budget records deficits. The .Ianuary 1996 STA technical assistance mission found that balance of payments data suffer from incomplete coverage and valuation probiems arising from the presence of- multiple exchange rates. At that time the current account data did not include re-exports and temporary imports: this has now been corrected. In 1997. the CBoS also began to collect data on foreign transactions by the communications and postal authorities to improve the estimates of government and other services. However. military imports are stilt excluded from the balance of payments. and private transfers do not full!; reflect remittances by Svrirlns Lvorking abroad. Estimates of travel, incIudiny both credit and debit. could also be improved. fn addition: the statistics in the balance ot‘ payments for offici;rl transfers differ sigiiiiieantlv from f-jgures provided from other sources such as donors. and data on ion:;-icrrn capitol inflows and amortisation sue not consistent .~vith the data provided by the h4inistry of Finance on the esrcrnai 5nancing of the budget deficit.

The balance of payments is compiled annually on a provisional basis with about an 8-month lag. The 1996 technical n,ssistance mission recommended that the CBS assign more staff to balance of payments compilation, undertake surveys to improve the coverage of a number of services and financial account items, develop closer liaison with various government agencies for the provision of balance of payments data, and that the balance of payments be compiled according to BMP5 methodology; this methodology was implemented beginning with 1996 data. However, staffing constraints within the CBS have not permitted additional resources to be directed to the balance of payments work, so that the compilation lag is unlikely to be reduced in the near future. 2. Core data Due to irregularity of receipt and lack of timeliness, core data provided to the Fund are inadequate for surveillance between consultations.

Consequently, private investment is assumed to recover slowly from the low level of 8.5 percent of GDP in 2000 to reach 11.5 percent of GDP at the end of the projection period. The volume of private sector exports is assumed to increase by an average of 3 percent per year over the projection period. National savings on average would exceed gross investment during the period. Prospects for growth would be constrained by the expected stability in oil production at a low level and the projected stability in the international oil prices at about US$19 per barrel during the projection period. The reduction in oil revenues would, in the absence of a sizable domestic revenue mobilization effort, constrain both current fiscal expenditures and public investment. Only new gas-related revenues would enable public investment to be maintained at about 12 percent of GDP during 2001-2006. However, without a broad-based sales tax and significant price adjustments for subsidized goods fiscal revenue will decline gradually reaching about 21 percent of GDP at the end of the projection period. In all, public savings would remain low during the projection period, and the overall deficit (including PSF subsidies) would average about 6.0 percent of GDP during the period. The modest private sector investment response to the gradualist policy approach would limit growth so the overall GDP growth would average about 3.7 percent per year. This would be insufficient to prevent higher unemployment if the population continues to increase at the current rate of about 2.7 percent per year. Nonetheless, the balance of payments would not come under pressure. The external current account would on average remain in balance during the projection period. Private imports are assumed to grow by 4.5 percent per year in real terms. Gross official reserves would rise gradually to the equivalent of about 1 I months’ of merchandize imports and the external debt ratio would stabilize at about 21 percent of GDP.
