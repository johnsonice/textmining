The discussions focused on containing public expenditure in order to reduce inflationary pressures, strengthening the monetary policy framework, and advancing financial sector reforms.  Economic developments and outlook Libya’s macroeconomic performance has been strong. GDP growth is broad-based and has strengthened further. Inflation, however, increased substantially in 2007 and has accelerated further in 2008. Both the fiscal and external current account positions are in large surpluses, and net foreign assets are accumulating rapidly. The medium-term outlook is favorable, underpinned by the expectation of high oil prices and increased infrastructure spending. A Wealth Distribution Program (WDP) was launched in March 2008 to distribute part of the oil revenue to the population and downsize public administration. The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) was established in March 2007 and its operational framework has been enhanced broadly in line with staff recommendations. Authorities’ views • Large public outlays are necessary to upgrade the infrastructure and share the oil wealth with the population.  • The acceleration in inflation has been driven mostly by higher import prices. To help reduce its domestic component, capital expenditure is being rationalized.  • Implementation of financial sector and other structural reforms will continue to be advanced to promote private sector development and employment. Staff recommendations • Public expenditure should be further rationalized if inflation does not decline. Prioritization would also preserve the quality of expenditure, and appropriate sequencing would minimize bottlenecks and shortages. • The scope of the WDP needs to be reduced in order to limit expenditure growth and maintain intergenerational equity. The restructuring of public administration should be carefully considered in close consultation with the World Bank. • The dinar’s peg to the SDR has served Libya well. An eventual move to greater exchange rate flexibility would be beneficial, but would need to be gradual and preceded by a switch to market-based monetary management.  • The commendable efforts to reform the financial sector and enhance the monetary policy framework should continue. • Staff encourages the authorities to limit any domestic investments by the LIA and to continue to enhance its operational framework in line with the evolving best practices for sovereign wealth funds.

The discussions were held against the backdrop of high oil revenue, robust growth, rapid increase in public expenditure, and rising inflation. The normalization of diplomatic relations with the U.S. and the EU in the second half of 2007 has contributed to increased foreign investors’ interest, particularly in the hydrocarbon, banking, and infrastructure sectors. A Wealth Distribution Program (WDP) was launched in March 2008 to distribute part of the oil wealth to the population and reduce the size of the government.1 Disbursements will be in the form of both cash and shares in projects. The initially announced amount was LD 25–30 billion ($20-25 billion), but only LD 4.6 billion ($3.8 billion) were subsequently approved for this year. The authorities are still considering the size, form, and modalities of the annual distributions in the years ahead.  2.      Past Fund policy advice has centered on the need to restore fiscal prudence, strengthen oil revenue management, develop a well-designed strategy to restructure public commercial banks, and advance structural reforms. The authorities have made good progress in some of these areas, particularly bank restructuring and privatization, the establishment of a modern sovereign wealth fund, and the initiation of an ambitious civil service reform.  B.   Recent Economic Developments 3.      Macroeconomic performance strengthened further in 2007, notwithstanding an acceleration in inflation. Real GDP grew by 6.8 percent, supported by an expansion in the hydrocarbon sector (3.9 percent) and a rapid increase in non-hydrocarbon activities (10.3 percent).2 Growth was particularly pronounced in construction, transportation, and trade. At the same time, average inflation increased substantially to 6.2 percent, largely driven by higher food prices and a marked increase in public expenditure.3 Inflation has accelerated further thus far in 2008, averaging about 12 percent in the first quarter (year-on-year).  4.      Despite higher oil revenues, Libya’s fiscal surplus in 2007 narrowed to 26 percent of GDP, compared to 35 percent in 2006. This reflected a rapid increase in virtually all                                                  1 This downsizing will be in addition to the large civil service reduction program, which started before the WDP was launched. 2 Libya is the third largest African oil producer and has the largest proven reserves in the continent (43.7 billion barrels at end-2007). Libya comes fourth in Africa in terms of natural gas production and reserves (equivalent to about 0.25 million barrels per day and 9 billion barrels of oil, respectively).   3 The largest contributor to inflation was the rise in food prices (12 percent), followed by dwelling (7 percent). The increase in the prices of other items was much smaller.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 5 expenditure items (45 percent). The wage bill increased by around 50 percent. The raise in public wages was accompanied by an initiation of a large civil service reform, with about one third of public employees being transferred to a central labor office for retraining or retrenchment.

It declined to 34 percent of GDP, compared to 46 percent in 2006, due to a marked increase in imports (33 percent). Continued high oil exports resulted in a further build up of the net foreign assets of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) to almost $80 billion. The real effective exchange rate of the dinar appreciated by 1 percent in 2007, and about 5 percent in the first quarter of 2008 due to the combined effects of the rising inflation and the strengthening of the euro.4  6.      Broad money growth more than doubled to 41 percent in 2007, reflecting the substantial increase in net foreign assets and the rapid increase in public expenditure, including on-lending by specialized credit institutions (SCIs). Credit to the nongovernment sector extended by these institutions grew by about 36 percent, while that extended by commercial banks grew by about 15 percent. Interest rates remained low and became largely negative in real terms with the rise in inflation.5 7.       Notable progress has been made in banking sector reforms (Box 1). Two of the three remaining public commercial banks were merged in April 2008. Most regional banks have also been merged into one bank, and agreement has been reached with financial institutions from UAE and Qatar to establish two new banks. 8.      Commercial banks are well capitalized, but the quality of their assets needs to be further improved. Their overall capital adequacy ratio stood at about 15 percent at end-2007. However, nonperforming loans (NPLs) constituted 25 percent of total loans. While still high, this ratio compares favorably to its peak of almost 36 percent in 2004. Provisioning for these loans has increased to about 67 percent. 9.      The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) was established in March 2007. The authorities plan to invest the LIA’s initial $40–50 billion on a commercial basis and ensure that the LIA will be run by a qualified and independent management. Recent enhancements of its operational framework are largely in line with staff’s recommendations (Box 2).                                                  4 The euro area is Libya’s largest trading partner. 5 The interest rates on CBL’s CDs and on 1-year deposits stood at 2.25 and 4.5 percent, respectively, at end-April 2008.

It comprises eleven commercial banks, four SCIs, 48 regional banks (most of which have already been merged), one exchange bureau, and five insurance companies. The five largest commercial banks were all state-owned until 2006. Since then, two have been privatized and two merged. The SCIs are also state-owned and financed by the government.  • Financial intermediation continues to be low in Libya compared to other Maghreb countries. Commercial banks’ credit has been on a downward trend (reaching 13 percent of GDP in 2007) as it was being crowded-out by credit from SCIs.   020406080100120LibyaAlgeria Morocco  TunisiaMauritaniaCredit to the Private Sector/GDPBroad Money/GDPRegional Comparative Indicators for Financial Intermediation, 2007(in percent)  0102030405020022003200420052006200701020304050Currency outside banks/broad moneyCredit to the economy/GDPCredit to the private sector/GDPLibya: Financial intermediation remains low(In percent)  • Bank privatization started in 2007. BNP Paribas acquired 19 percent of Sahara Bank in August 2007, with immediate management control and option to purchase additional shares of up to 51 percent within 3–5 years. Wahda Bank was acquired by Arab Bank in February 2008 under similar terms.  • Tangible progress has been made in banking supervision, but important shortcomings remain. In particular, there is a need to strengthen licensing procedures, the reporting of banks’ financial statements, and on-site inspection. The CBL is implementing a substantial IMF TA program, including with METAC, to improve capacity in off-site supervision, loan classifications, and capital adequacy calculation. Furthermore, the authorities reached a technical cooperation agreement with the Fund to field peripatetic and resident experts in banking supervision and central bank restructuring.    • The capital and insurance market are in their infancy. The stock exchange was established in 2006. By end-2007, seven companies (mostly banks) were listed with a capitalization of  LD 1.2 billion (1.4 percent of GDP). The insurance sector is small and largely underdeveloped, with total market premium income at LD 190 million in 2006.

The Libyan Investment Authority  • The LIA started operations in June 2007 to manage the financial assets allocated to it by the State, including the Oil Reserve Fund. The intention is to build a high quality and well-diversified investment portfolio in order to create a high and sustainable source of revenue, with a view to reducing dependency on oil. The LIA consolidated pre-existing funds such as the Libya Foreign Investment Company and the Libyan African Investment Portfolio. • The LIA invests its assets on a commercial basis mostly abroad through reputable international managers. It may, however, make direct investments domestically or internationally with strategic partners. Its organizational structure is being developed with assistance from international consultants. Its Board of Trustees is headed by the prime minister and its Board of Directors is advised by a committee of international financial experts. An international consulting firm is helping the LIA develop a process for selecting and evaluating reputable investment managers for the different asset classes. The LIA intends to meet high transparency standards.  • Staff reviewed the LIA draft law in November 2007 and recommended revisions to remove or limit the provisions that would allow the LIA to invest domestically, on-lend, and play a developmental role. Staff also recommended that the LIA’s relationship with the state budget be clarified further, including by explicitly allowing larger withdrawals from the LIA under exceptional circumstances, and that more specific transparency requirements be spelled out. A decree was issued in March 2008, broadly encompassing staff’s recommendations.  II.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS 10.      Against the above background, the policy discussions focused on containing expenditure growth, enhancing the monetary policy framework, and further advancing financial sector reforms. A.   Outlook and Risks 11.      Libya’s economic growth and financial position are expected to strengthen further in 2008 and over the medium term as a result of high oil receipts, the upgrading of the infrastructure, and increased interest of foreign investors. Oil production is projected to increase substantially to about 3 million barrels per day by 2013 on account of large investments and the utilization of advanced technologies by foreign partners. Many projects in the non-hydrocarbon sectors are intended 02468101214162004200520062007200820092010201120122013In percent0102030405060In percent of GDPReal non-hydrocarbon growth (left axis)Current account balance (right axis)Fiscal balance (right axis)Figure 2. Libya: Medium-Term Outlook Projections Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 9 to be completed by the 40th anniversary of the revolution in 2009. The growth of both public expenditure and imports is, therefore, expected to decelerate to a more moderate pace starting in 2010. Taking into account the authorities’ intention to continue to prioritize public expenditure, it is projected to stabilize as a percent of GDP. The fiscal surplus is thus expected to slightly increase to 37 percent of GDP over the medium term, while the external current account surplus is projected to moderate to 32 percent. A stabilization of international food prices and a careful sequencing of investment projects to minimize bottlenecks and shortages would help put inflation on a downward trend. The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook described above.  12.      This favorable outlook is subject to downside risks, especially if oil prices turn out lower than projected or the resolve to limit public expenditure growth (including in the context of the WDP) wavers. If these risks materialize, the fiscal and external balances could be considerably weaker than the above projections, with adverse consequences on inter-generational equity, and inflation could further increase beyond its present low double-digit level. A further acceleration in public expenditure would also likely lead to deterioration in its quality, with negative implications for the GDP growth outlook. B.   Fiscal Policy 13.      The 2008 budget reflects a continuation of the expansionary fiscal stance as it entails a large increase in public expenditure. Current expenditure is envisaged to increase by about 50 percent, compared to 2007, largely on account of transfers related to the WDP. The total of the wage bill and monthly transfers related to severance payments are projected to increase by around 15 percent. Capital expenditure would grow by about 38 percent, compared to the budgeted increase of almost 80 percent, as the authorities intend to implement about 70 percent of the budgeted amount. All in all, public expenditure would increase by about 40 percent. Although both the overall and the non-oil balances are projected to strengthen, the non-oil deficit in percent of non-oil GDP will widen further. 14.      The authorities are taking steps to reduce the impact of the rapid growth of expenditure on its quality and inflation. They noted that much of the inflationary pressures are due to the rise in imports prices. Nonetheless, they are concerned about the pace of the recent acceleration in prices and have formed a ministerial committee to monitor the situation and take policy actions. In addition to the ongoing rationalization of capital outlays, close attention is being accorded to sequencing. Some large projects are being postponed and competition among suppliers is being boosted by enhancing the regulations governing agency. In addition, in order to enhance efficiency, public-private partnerships (PPPs) are also being considered for utilities and other projects. Furthermore, on-lending by SCIs is being curbed by limiting their access to budget financing.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 10 15.      The authorities are determined to move ahead with the WDP in order to enhance equity and the delivery of public services.6 They were aware of its potential risks for inflation and, if not implemented carefully, its effectiveness in achieving its intended goals. While they are still working out its details, they intend to ensure that its design addresses these risks. Assuming that WDP’s transfers remain (as a percent of GDP) at their approved 2008 level and that the plan to limit the growth of other public outlays continues to be implemented, Libya’s fiscal position will remain sustainable (Box 3).  16.      The authorities intend to ensure that the LIA’s regulatory framework meets high transparency and operational standards. The state budget will continue to be based on conservative oil price assumptions7 and the realized surpluses will be allocated to the LIA. Transfers from the LIA to the budget will not exceed its profit. Recent enhancements in the LIA’s operational framework limited its domestic investments to the oil sector and instated specific auditing and publication requirements.  C.   Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform 17.      The CBL has redoubled its efforts to enhance the monetary policy framework and tighten monetary conditions. It introduced its own certificates of deposit, with Fund technical assistance, in May 2008. The policy interest rates were raised by 50 basis points, and the reserves requirement increased from 15 percent to 20 percent. The CBL is also embarking on a substantial technical cooperation program with the Fund to modernize its structure and enhance the payments system, with a view to improving its ability to conduct monetary policy.  18.      Efforts are ongoing to further strengthen bank supervision. In particular, off-site surveillance techniques are being improved and methodologies to calculate capital adequacy measures are being modernized. The authorities also intend to strengthen CBL’s supervision of SCIs. Regarding the AML/CFT, an amended law is being drafted to explicitly criminalize the financing of terrorism. 19.      The authorities continue to advance financial sector reforms. They indicated that the recent progress in bank reforms and opening the market to foreign banks have laid the foundation for a competitive banking system. They intend to privatize the remaining two public commercial banks through the newly established stock market. They are also considering contracting international consultants to design an action plan to reform the SCIs.                                                   6 The WDP aims at improving the delivery of public services through replacing several ministries with smaller administrative bodies and transferring of the ownership and management of a large number of public entities to the population. 7 These assumptions were $35 and $65 per barrel for 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Fiscal Sustainability To assess fiscal sustainability, staff conducted an analysis using a permanent income approach that aims at ensuring intergenerational equity (Barnett and Ossowski 2002). According to this approach, annual public expenditure should not exceed the implicit return on government wealth. This means that the non-hydrocarbon deficit should be smaller than or equal to the returns on the government’s net worth. To maintain intergenerational equity, population growth is taken into account. The analysis assumes a hydrocarbon production profile that would deplete proven reserves by 2070. The extraction rate is based on the authorities’ announced plans for the medium term.   The results show that Libya’s fiscal position is sustainable based on current policies. However, the analysis is sensitive to changes in oil prices and to the implicit rate of return. For example, a drop in oil prices to about $80 per barrel, while maintaining spending at the same level, would render the medium-term fiscal position unsustainable. Fiscal sustainability would also be challenged should the implicit rate of return decline by more than one percentage point (from the baseline assumption of 5 percent).      Given the uncertainty regarding future oil prices and rate of returns, the above analysis calls for caution. The fiscal position needs to be assessed periodically in line with any significant changes in the outlook. The fiscal stance also needs to be considered in line with developments in inflation. Implementation capacity is also an important factor in determining the appropriate pace of expenditure growth and its sectoral distribution. The World Bank is currently conducting a public expenditure review that should provide useful guidance in these areas.   01234200620122018202420302036204220482054206020660(Natural gas production (right axis)(billion cubic meters per year)Libya: Oil and Natural Gas Production Profile, 2006-701020304050607080Oil production (left axis)million barrels per day) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 12 D.   External Sector Issues 20.      Staff’s estimates suggest that the dinar is moderately undervalued (Box 4). The estimated undervaluation is, however, within the margin of error associated with this type of analysis. Furthermore, this undervaluation is likely to be transitional in view of the fiscal and current account projections that are based on current policies. The ongoing appreciation of the dinar in real effective terms is already capturing part of the improvement in fundamentals, and the current account surplus is projected to moderate over the medium term in line with import growth and the projected stabilization in oil prices.  21.      The SDR continues to be an appropriate peg for the Libyan dinar. While most of Libya’s imports originate in the euro area, oil (which constitutes more than 95 percent of Libya’s exports) is priced in dollars. Furthermore, the SDR offers the advantage of being a transparent and straight-forward basket that is not vulnerable to pressure for change based on short-term developments in the world economy or Libya’s trading pattern. E.   Structural Reforms and Other Issues 22.      Progress has been made on various structural reforms, partly in line with past Fund TA recommendations and the Medium-Term Reform Strategy (SM/06/90). A sound framework for the management of the oil wealth has been established through the creation of the LIA; customs administration has been reformed and a large taxpayer’s office established; the presentation of the budget has been consolidated and a macrofiscal unit initiated; a large number of public enterprises have been privatized; and one third of public employees are being retrenched to the private sector. 23.      Some progress has been made in implementing reforms aimed at achieving greater regional integration and liberalizing trade. Harmonization of financial regulations, statistical frameworks, and payment and settlement systems with other Maghreb countries is ongoing. Certification requirements for trade with these countries have also been simplified. However, while customs duties on virtually all imports have been eliminated, imports-specific production and consumption taxes, in addition to a flat 4 percent “service” fee, are in place. Furthermore, ear-marked fees on imports, albeit small, have been recently introduced. Nonetheless, the effective rate of import taxation remains very low (less than 3 percent) due to extensive exemptions. 24.      Libya’s debt relief to heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) continues to be based on forgiving interest payments and using a combination of swaps and rescheduling of principal. The authorities indicated that agreements based on these modalities have already been reached with some HIPCs, and that negotiations are ongoing with others.

Exchange Rate Assessment  Staff’s econometric estimates suggest that the dinar is moderately undervalued, but this may be a transitory phenomenon. Using the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach,1 the results indicate an undervaluation in the range of 15–20 percent at end-2007. Since then, however, the dinar has appreciated by about 5 percent in real effective terms. It should be noted that this estimated range of undervaluation could be within the usually high error range associated with these exercises, which is due to data and methodological shortcomings. The latter is particularly relevant in oil developing countries, for which the appropriate analytical framework is still evolving.   The above results are confirmed by another exercise that estimates the external current account “norm.”2 The results indicate that Libya’s external current account surplus is at present above its norm, implying an undervaluation of the exchange rate. However, the current account surplus is projected to decline steadily toward the norm over the medium term, with the continued increase in imports and the stabilization of oil prices.  The results need to be interpreted with caution. These projections are sensitive to assumptions on future oil prices and public expenditure (and thus import) growth. Should oil prices decline below the current high projections or the efforts to rationalize the large expenditure plans waver, revised current account projections could converge to the norm earlier in the medium term.  1“Methodology for CGER Exchange Rate Assessments,” IMF, November 2006 (www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2006/110806.pdf). The equilibrium REER was estimated by a vector error-correction model in which the following set of fundamentals were the determining variables: terms of trade, public consumption as a percent of GDP, per capita income relative to trading partners, and net foreign assets as a percent of GDP. 2Data for eight countries (the GCC countries, Algeria, and Libya) were used to estimate the current account norm based on the following set of fundamentals: the fiscal balance, net foreign assets, the external oil balance, real per capita GDP growth, and population growth.   4080120160-500501001508082848688909294969800020406Libya: Actual and Estimated Equilibrium REEREquilibrium REER (left scale)REER (left scale)Misalignment using HP filter (In percent, right scale)Libya: Projected CA and CA Norm Under Current Fiscal Stance (in percent of GDP; 2004-13)2025303540455055602004200520062007200820092010201120122013202530354045505560Projected CA CA Norm    Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 14 25.      Progress has been made in improving economic and financial statistics. National accounts and price statistics have been recently strengthened. The quality and timeliness of macroeconomic data have also been improved over the past few years. Further enhancing the compilation and quality of data continues to be hampered by insufficient coordination between different government agencies and staffing limitations. III.   STAFF APPRAISAL 26.      Libya’s economy has performed strongly in recent years, benefiting from a favorable external environment and ongoing reforms. Growth remained buoyant, reflecting higher international oil prices and continued strong expansion of the non-hydrocarbon sectors. The fiscal and external current accounts registered large surpluses, and CBL’s net foreign assets are accumulating rapidly. Inflation has, however, accelerated owing mainly to the increase in food prices and public expenditure. 27.      Efforts to contain inflation should focus on tightening the fiscal stance by limiting the rapid increase in public expenditure, which is also posing significant risks for expenditure quality. While such increase appears affordable under current oil prices, it has contributed to a substantial rise in the non-oil fiscal deficit in relation to the non-hydrocarbon GDP. Although upgrading the infrastructure is essential to expand growth potential, it is important to continue to prioritize public investment. Scaling back more of the planned projects may be necessary, especially if inflation does not decline. It is also critical to adhere to the plan to limit any further increases in public wages and complete the civil service reform. Public financial management also needs to be further improved, including by unifying the process of budget preparation and implementation under the Ministry of Finance, and ensuring that the macrofiscal unit is enabled to fully perform its role.  28.      Staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to limit the scope of the WDP in 2008 and urges them to maintain this approach in the period ahead. A less cautious approach would substantially increase the risk of crowding-out priority spending, encourage rent-seeking activities, and significantly contribute to further inflationary pressures. Larger transfers to the population in the context of a full-fledged WDP would likely be mostly channeled to consumption or inefficient investments. This would not be the best way to utilize revenue from exhaustible resources and would jeopardize intergenerational equity. While revamping public administration in the context of the WDP presents an opportunity to address inefficiencies, if not done properly, it can pose serious risks for the delivery of essential public services. Staff, therefore, urges the authorities to carefully consider such plans in close consultation with the World Bank.  29.      It is encouraging that the LIA has been launched in a transparent fashion and that its operational framework has been enhanced. In this connection, it would be important not to grant exceptions to the rules restricting domestic investments by the LIA, as such investments should be limited to what is envisaged in the state budget. Ensuring that the  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 15 LIA invests exclusively abroad on a commercial basis would best serve its core objective of protecting Libya’s savings for present and future generations. This would also avoid complicating the macroeconomic management of the domestic economy. Staff encourages the authorities to continue to enhance the operational framework of the LIA in line with the evolving best practices for sovereign wealth funds.   30.      Staff welcomes CBL’s recent efforts to reduce excess liquidity. While the scope for monetary policy is limited by the pegged exchange rate regime, there is a clear margin for further tightening especially in view of the largely negative interest rates. The recent increase in the CBL policy rates is, therefore, a step in the right direction. The increase in the reserves requirement will also contribute to these efforts, although greater reliance on indirect monetary policy instruments would be beneficial. It is also encouraging that lending by SCIs is being curbed by limiting their access to budget financing. 31.      The recent introduction of CBL’s certificates of deposit is an important step toward enhancing the monetary policy framework. Ongoing efforts to restructure the CBL and enhance the payments system would also help improve the effectiveness of indirect monetary policy instruments. The success of CBL’s efforts to enhance monetary policy management will, however, remain contingent on close coordination with fiscal policy to limit the injection of liquidity, including by the SCIs.  32.      Staff welcomes the ongoing strengthening of banking supervision, including by improving off-site surveillance techniques. Supervision would benefit further from enhanced coordination between the off-site and on-site units as well as capacity building through additional staffing and training. It is also crucial to bring the SCIs under CBL’s full supervision to protect the quality of their assets. The fact that SCIs are currently subject to less stringent supervision than commercial banks could contribute to the dissemination of risky lending practices. The rapid pace at which they have been expanding soft loans and their very low cost of funding have contributed to the depressed lending and deposit rates in the financial system in general. Unless this situation is addressed, it would lead to a deterioration in financial intermediation and hinder the development of the banking system. It would also be important to develop modern regulatory and supervisory frameworks for the insurance sector and the newly-established stock market. 33.      The steady progress made in bank privatization is encouraging. Ensuring a leveled playing field between the commercial banks and the SCIs, as well as continuing to open the market to foreign banks, would help establish a competitive banking sector that can support non-oil growth and job creation. In this connection, it would be useful to finalize the plans to privatize the two remaining public commercial banks and to establish an independent bank restructuring agency that would take over ownership of the SCIs and oversee their restructuring and privatization.

This arrangement provides a strong monetary anchor, while allowing some flexibility in the dinar’s exchange rate vis-à-vis individual major currencies. The dinar appears to be moderately undervalued, but this is likely to be a transitory phenomenon in view of the projected decline in the current account surplus. An eventual move to greater exchange rate flexibility would be beneficial but would need to be gradual and preceded by a switch to market-based monetary management and the development of expertise in foreign exchange markets.  35.      Staff encourages the authorities to make further progress in implementing structural reforms. In this regard, it would be crucial to enhance the regulatory environment, including to support the ongoing effort to implement part of Libya’s ambitious investment program in the context of PPP arrangements within adequate safeguards. Building on the progress achieved in simplifying the customs regime would also be important. In this connection, the mission encourages the authorities to eliminate the service fee imposed on imports, as well as import-specific consumption and production taxes and ear-marked fees.  36.      Staff encourages the authorities to provide full debt relief to heavily indebted poor countries in line with the HIPC Initiative. 37.      While data provision is adequate for surveillance, the authorities are encouraged to continue to improve economic and financial statistics in order to facilitate better monitoring and analysis of developments to guide policy formulation. 38.      It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Libya take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

The normalization of diplomatic relations with the U.S. and the EU in the second half of 2007 has contributed to increased foreign investors’ interest, particularly in the hydrocarbon, banking, and infrastructure sectors. However, while progress has been min recent years to liberalize the economy, it remains largely state controlled and heavily dependent on hydrocarbon resources. Crude oil and gas accounted for about 70 percenGDP, 90 percent of total government revenues, and 98 percent of total exports in 2007.  oil wealth to the population and reduce the size of the government.

A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [July, 18, 2008] Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

The authorities are still considering the size, form, and modalities of the annual distributions in the years ahead. Macroeconomic performance strengthened further in 2007, notwithstanding an acceleration in inflation. Real GDP grew by 6.8 percent, supported by an expansion in the hydrocarbon sector (3.9 percent) and a rapid increase in nonhydrocarbon activities (10.3 percent). Growth was particularly strong in construction, transportation, and trade. At the same time, average inflation increased substantially to 6.2 percent, largely driven by higher food prices and a marked increase in public expenditure. Inflation accelerated further in the first quarter of 2008, averaging about 12 percent (year-on-year). Despite higher oil revenues, Libya’s fiscal surplus in 2007 narrowed to 26 percent of GDP, compared to 35 percent in 2006. This reflected a rapid increase in virtually all expenditure items (45 percent), albeit at a slightly slower rate than what was envisaged in the budget. The decision to raise public wages resulted in an increase in the wage bill of around 50 percent. Capital expenditure also grew rapidly.  On the external side, The current account surplus declined to 34 percent of GDP, compared to 46 percent in 2006, due to a marked increase in imports (33 percent). Continued high oil exports resulted in a further build up of the net foreign assets of Central Bank of Libya (CBL) to almost $80 billion. The real effective exchange rate of the dinar appreciated by 1 percent in 2007, and about 5 percent in the first quarter of 2008 due to the combined effects of the rising inflation and the strengthening of the euro against the SDR (to which the dinar is pegged).  Broad money growth accelerated to 41 percent in 2007, reflecting the substantial increase in net foreign assets and the rapid increase in public expenditure, including on-lending by SCIs. Credit extended to the nongovernment sector by these institutions grew by about 36 percent, while that extended by commercial banks grew by about 15 percent. Interest rates remained low and became negative in real terms with the rise in inflation. In an effort to address excess liquidity, the CBL recently increased its policy interest rate to 2.25 percent and the reserves requirement to 20 percent. It introduced in May 2008 its own certificates of deposit as part of its ongoing effort to enhance the monetary policy framework.  The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) was established in March 2007. The authorities plan to invest the LIA’s initial $40–50 billion mostly abroad on a commercial basis and ensure that the LIA will be run by a qualified and independent management. Recent enhancements of its operational framework are largely in line with staff’s recommendations.   Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  25    Progress has been made in various structural reforms, partly in line with past Fund TA recommendations and the Medium-Term Reform Strategy (Country Report 06/137). A sound framework for the management of the oil wealth has been established through the creation of the LIA. Customs administration has been reformed and a large taxpayer’s office established; the presentation of the budget has been consolidated and a macrofiscal unit initiated; a large number of public enterprises have been privatized; and one third of public employees are being retrenched to the private sector. Two large state-owned banks were privatized in 2007 and 2008, and two of the three remaining public commercial banks were merged in April, 2008. Most regional banks have also been merged into one bank, and agreement has been reached with financial institutions from UAE and Qatar to establish two new banks.   Libya’s debt relief to heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) continues to be based on forgiving interest payments and using a combination of swaps and rescheduling of principal. The authorities indicated that agreements based on these modalities have already been reached with some HIPCs, and that negotiations are ongoing with others.
