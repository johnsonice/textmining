Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Madagascar were held in Antananarivo during November 8-22, 1994 and February 6-23, 1995. I-/ On the occasion of the February 1995 discussions, the authorities formulated a program for 1995 that provides a macroeconomic framework for the control of inflation (see Attachment). They also requested Fund support under the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) as soon as possible. The World Bank is considering support for Madagascar's adjustment effort through a structural adjustment credit (SAC). The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation with Madagascar on November 24, 1993. u At that time, Directors expressed concern over the severe deterioration of Madagascar's economy, and stressed the urgent need to resume a comprehensive medium-term adjustment effort. II. Background Madagascar has experienced a generally declining trend in real per capita income over the past two decades. This trend was briefly interrupted in 1989-90, when the authorities undertook a structural adjustment program supported by two annual ESAF arrangements. However, negotiations on a program that could be supported by the third annual ESAF arrangement could not be completed because of civil unrest, and Madagascar entered a period of political tensions that hampered economic management and decision making. The outlook for economic policy formulation improved in early 1994, as the authorities prepared a new medium-term policy statement. This provided a framework for the liberalization of the economy, particularly of the oil, foodstuffs, vanilla, transport, and telecommunications sectors; reform of the investment code; and formulation of the legal basis for privatization of publicly owned industrial and commercial enterprises, including divestiture of the two state-owned banks. u The Malagasy representatives included: in November, Prime Minister Francisque Ravony, Finance Minister Jose Raserijaona, and Central Bank Governor Raoul Ravelomanana; and in February, Prime Minister Francisque Ravony and Acting Governor Gaston Ravelojaona. The staff representatives were: in November, Mr. Dhonte (head), Mr. Fasano, Mr. Toujas-Bernate (all AFR), Mr. Sidgwick (PDR), and Ms. Culp (administrative assistant-AFR); and in February, Mr. Dhonte (head), Mr. Fasano, Mr. Toujas-Bernate, and Mr. Briffaux (all AFR). Mr. Ismael, Advisor to the Executive Director for Madagascar, took part in the February discussions. Mr. Youm, the Fund's resident representative in Madagascar, assisted both missions. The Fund teams worked closely with parallel World Bank missions in Antananarivo. 2/ Notices of delay were issued on February 3, 1995 (EBD/95/18), and on March 31, 1995 (EBD/95/50). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 2 - Accordingly, a sweeping reform of the exchange and trade system was implemented in May 1994. The Malagasy franc was floated in the context of an interbank foreign exchange market, ensuring relatively free access to foreign currency for current account purposes. I/ The exchange rate liberalization was accompanied by a reduction of customs duties, the removal of quantitative import restrictions, and increases in the limits on payments for invisible transactions. Whereas the official exchange rate was FMG 333 = F 1 ,in April 1994, and the parallel market rate was reported to be in the range of FMG 500-600 - F 1, the interbank rate fluctuated in May-July and settled down to about FMG 700 = F 1 in August-December. In January 1995 the rate slipped abruptly to FMG 800 - F 1, and it dropped further to about FMG 835 in late March. Some parallel market activity is continuing, and the FMG is said to be trading at a modest discount in that market. The liberalization of the exchange system was not adequately supported by financial policies, however. Initially, the Central Bank increased its base lending rate and the reserve requirement ratios, but two adverse developments derailed this effort. First, taxes that should have been levied on foodstuffs and oil products were not collected, in an attempt to dampen consumer price inflation; the resulting revenue shortfall predictably led to a sharp acceleration in money creation and in the CPI, which rose b,y more than 60 percent through 1994. Second, attempts were made to place large amounts of promissory notes in the international market; not surprisingly, none of these schemes came to a positive end, but the credibility of the Central Bank was damaged in the process, and the formulation of consistent economic policies was delayed. In view of these inconsistencies, the staff seized several opportu- nities in 1994 to emphasize the dangers of the accelerating inflation, and suggested that the authorities give strong signals of their determination to combat these dangers, which jeopardized the implementation of the structural adjustment policies outlined in their medium-term policy statement. A number of political changes and a decision to eliminate subsidies'on flour in January 1995 were cited by the authorities as providing such signals. The authorities' program for 1995 aims at reducing the rate of consumer price inflation to 15 percent, on a December-December basis. The key to this objective is a sharp deceleration in monetary growth, which is to be realized by the elimination of domestic monetary financing of the Government. To this effect, the authorities have introduced in early 1995 substantial increases in administered prices. These increases have been supported by various social measures, and wage adjustments are under consideration. Taking a longer historical view, developments over the past two decades have Left certain marks on the Ma1agas.y economy that are relevant for I/ Exchange bureaus may also operate, but no request for a license has yet been received.

It remains largely rural (with a rate of urbanization of less than 25 percent) and in need of more education (with less than one half of the relevant age group completing primary education) and of better housing--a few thousand new homes are delivered each year, as against a demographic requirement on the order of 150,000. Urban employment is minimal--700,000, half of which is formal, and of this amount, one half is in the public sector, compared with a population of 12 million. Recorded salaried employment has been flat over the past two years, while the population has risen by over 600,000. Second, real wages are low, with minimum wages close to subsistence levels. Moreover, investment has generally not exceeded 11 percent of GDP in the past two decades. Therefore, the way to adjust unit labor costs to full employment levels cannot be to cut real earnings further but to maintain a free exchange system in order to foster efficient resource utilization, and to create favorable conditions for a sustained high level of investment. Third, public expenditure is very restrained. The government wage bill amounts to only 3.5 percent of GDP, having declined by 22 percent in real terms in 1992-94; and, owing to a prolonged hiring freeze, the median age of civil servants is over 50. Government expenditure on materials and supplies is minimal, and investment in the social sectors is barely equivalent to 1 percent of GDP. In total, noninterest expenditure--including the wage bill, operating outlays, transfers, and the domestic financing of the investment budget-- amounted to 8.6 percent of GDP in 1994. Clearly, the issue is to obtain more revenues and improve the composition of expenditures, not to cut expenditures further. Fourth, Madagascar has been experiencing a continuous acceleration in the rate of growth of money supply over the past two decades, generating two episodes of strong consumer price inflation--in 1979-83 and from mid-1993 (Chart 1). This trend needs to be brought under control in order to establish a suitable investment climate. III. Report on the Discussions The focus of the discussions was the acceleration of inflation in Madagascar since mid-1993. The authorities recognized that the upsurge in consumer prices signaled a need to resume the implementation of broad-based adjustment policies. The staff was concerned that the significant progress made in liberalizing the exchange system in early 1994 would be at risk if inflation could not be controlled. There was agreement, therefore, that the authorities' target to bring inflation down to 15 percent in 1995 represented a desirable policy objective.

Fiscal policv Government revenue performance in 1994 was disappointing. The authorities linked the fall in the tax ratio, from 8.2 percent of GDP in 1993 to 7.3 percent in 1994, to several factors. The main factor was the attempt to ease pressures on consumer prices by not levying scheduled taxes on foodstuffs and oil products. The cost in forgone revenue had been largely overlooked at the time, and was later estimated at FMG 170 billion (26 percent of actual tax revenue) in 1994. Furthermore, government loans of some FMG 52 billion were provided to finance rice imports (included as extrabudgetary outlays), and vanilla export taxes were only partially collected. The total cost of all these operations amounted to the equivalent of almost 3 percent of GDP. Also, successive changes in tax laws had hampered tax administration. A broad reform of indirect taxes had taken effect on January 1, 1994, with the creation of a turnover tax, but this had been rescinded in September. At that time, a value-added tax (VAT) was introduced at a single rate of 25 percent, with surcharges of 5-120 percent on luxury goods, and the maximum import tariff was reduced from 50 percent to 30 percent. The staff was of the view that the new VAT was less than fully satisfactory, because of its high rate and limited domestic coverage-- estimated to be equivalent to less than 7 percent of GDP. The revenue loss was offset to some extent by stringent government expenditure ceilings, and noninterest outlays (excluding foreign-financed investment) shrank from the equivalent of 10.8 percent of GDP in 1993 to 8.6 percent in 1994. Such stringency testified to remarkable forbearance on the part of the authorities and the public, but it was hardly reconcilable with the developmental objectives of Madagascar's medium-term program, and it could not prevent a widening of domestic financing needs. Turning to 1995, the authorities' approach regarding revenue has been to curb all ad hoc tax exemptions (including the rice exemption), and they accordingly liberalized the price of flour in January, allowing it to double at the retail level. Moreover, a new price formula for oil products (that became effective on February 22) was consistent with the collection of excise duties at a level chosen in consultation with the World Bank. On this basis, and assuming that no new ad hoc tax exemptions would be granted, the staff estimated that revenue would increase by 2.1 points, to the equivalent of 9.4 percent of GDP in 1995. Moreover, in view of the upheaval created by the successive changes in indirect taxation during 1994, the staff suggested that it would be wise to freeze the tax system temporarily, and, in 1995, to focus instead on strengthening tax administration. Meanwhile, a tripartite effort by the Fund, the World Bank, and the French Ministry of Cooperation is under consideration to determine specific measures to increase Madagascar's tax receipts in the medium term. Regarding expenditure, initial appropriations for 1995 (as voted by Parliament) would have entailed further sharp reductions, both relative to GDP and in real terms. The authorities and the staff agreed that personnel appropriations should be restored to the low point of 3.5 percent of GDP Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - reached in 1994, and that some provision must be made for a social safety net to accompany the price adjustments. The investment budget was sharply increased, to 9 percent of GDP from 6.9 percent in 1994, with its level and composition being based on the World Bank's recommendations regarding the Public Investment Program (PIP); there was a possibility, however, that the rate of implementation might be less than 100 percent. Finally, estimates of scheduled foreign interest payments were recalculated on a conservative basis, and were set at 7.3 percent of GDP (compared with 6.1 percent in 1994). Under these policies, which are expected to be confirmed by Parliament in a supplementary budget in June/July, the primary balance would switch from a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP in 1994 to a surplus of 1.4 percent in 1995. The overall deficit would, however, deteriorate to 12.7 percent of GDP, reflecting the higher scheduled foreign interest payments, and capital outlays to be financed by grants or IDA-type loans. Assuming that Madagascar would be granted debt relief and balance of payments support, these projections allowed a reduction in net 'bank credit to the Government in 1995 .by about FMG 57 billion, or some 0.5 .percent of GDP. 2. Monetary policy There was a widely held view in Madagascar that the marked acceleration in inflation in 1994 was due to the sharp depreciation of the Malagasy franc following the floating of the exchange rate and the introduction of the VAT at a high rate. However, it became apparent in the course of the discussions that the real money supply had been increasing steadily since 1989, suggesting a build-up of a monetary overhang. Moreover, nominal monetary growth had been accelerating from mid-1993, and had been powerfully reinforced by the additional treasury borrowing requirements on account of tax exemptions for foodstuffs, oil products, and vanilla exports. It was realized that these requirements, together with government lending for the import of rice, had amounted to fully one half of the total monetary creation in Malagasy francs in 1994. This provided impetus to the nascent view in Antananarivo that general subsidies for basic necessities were not an appro,priate way to extend a social safety .net, and that it would be more effective to curb inflation through a reduction in monetary growth than to try to mitigate its consequences. A clear responsibility for curbing inflation had been vested in the Central Bank by an act of June 1994 that established its independence. The monetary authorities indicated that they 'had increased the required reserve ratio to 25 percent in early 1994, to support the floating of the Malagasy franc. Moreover, successive increases had raised the central bank base lending rate from 12 percent a year in April 1994 to 23.75 percent in early 1995, and the penalty rate on reserve deficiencies from 25 percent to 35 percent. They felt that the disparate conditions in the banking system did not favor further increases. The authorities and the staff concurred on the urge'ncy of restoring the prudential ratios of the two state-owned banks, as a first step to a more comprehensive refor:m, and the authorities set a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - June deadline for this objective. The staff advised that, meanwhile, the structure of reserve ratios would best be left untouched. Within the existing framework, though, the staff strongly supported the use of remunerated deposit facilities at the Central Bank as a means of adjusting the incentives structure, especially in circumstances of downward pressure on the exchange rate. Such facilities have indeed been actively used in March and April 1995. As regards the monetary targets for 1995, M2 growth was programmed to decelerate from 48 percent in 1994 to 14.5 percent through 1995. Bec:,use of the "crowding in" effects of negative government monetary financing ald of the availability of additional foreign medium- and long-term credit lines (equivalent to 4.3 percent of initial money supply), credit to the ecc>nomy could increase by as much as 24 percent. The implementation of this policy would rest primarily on controlling the evolution of net domestic assets of the Central Bank, which were expected to increase by less than 2.5 percent in 1995. In addition, and given the difficult financial situation of the two state-owned commercial banks, credit ceilings by banks would be maintained as a safeguard, until the use of indirect instruments showed higher efficiency. 3. External policies The free floating of the Malagasy franc, which had been in effect since May 9, 1994, had served well in a troubled period in maintaining relatively free access to foreign currency for current account purposes. Meanwhile, the freely usable international assets of the Central Bank had increased from the equivalent of SDR 3.9 million at end-April 1994 to SDR 21.5 million at end-January 1995. The staff noted with concern, however, a deterioration in the modus operandi of the foreign exchange market in early 1995. Whereas some short- term rationing had long been present in the market, it had recently assumed disturbing proportions. The staff expressed particular alarm in reaction to rumors that queuing for foreign exchange was sometimes regulated on "merit" rather than pure antecedence, and stressed that it would be better to increase interest rates and let the exchange rate move rather than condone such practices. The depreciation of the nominal exchange rate following the liberalization of the foreign exchange market had reversed the previous real appreciation initiated at end-1991. Thus, by January 1995, the real effective exchange rate had depreciated by 35 percent relative to the level of January 1994 (Chart 2). The lack of employment growth since 1991 provided a strong indication that competitiveness had been inadequate; however, the export structure had become well diversified, the terms of trade had been improving, and the main bottlenecks for export expansion were the deficiencies in infrastructure and the uncertain future course of government policies. The staff therefore thought that, at present cost Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicSELECTED EXCHANGE RATE INDICES, 197945 (1991=100; foreign currency per Malagasy franc) 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 350 300 250 200 150 100 . 50 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 9.2 93 94 $35 Source: IbF, Information Notice System.

Despite previous debt reschedulings, Madagascar had been accumulating external debt payments arrears to all creditors but the World Bank and the Fund since 1991; such arrears were estimated at SDR 1,140 million at end- 1994, including SDR 25 million to multilateral creditors. Total foreign debt outstanding amounted to SDR 2.9 billion at end-1994, of which SDR 334 million was owed to Russia, the largest outstanding debt among creditors outside the Paris Club. In 1994 bilateral discussions were resumed with Russia to reach a new debt settlement agreement based on the 1991 agreement and concessional terms comparable to those offered by Paris Club creditors. The authorities recognized that the debt overhang and the accumulation of arrears adversely affected the investment climate, and added that they would need to seek concessional treatment of the debt. In discussing these issues, the staff indicated that a strong adjustment program could form a basis for a new rescheduling of Madagascar's debt. Even under a concessional treatment in such a rescheduling, there would remain a need for substantial balance of payments support in 1995-98. While such support should be available from a variety of sources, the difficulty would be to secure it in a nonearmarked form. The authorities had made several attempts over the past 12 months to secure external financing on commercial terms. A number of promissory notes had been issued (some of which have been formally canceled), although no actual payment had been officially received in return. In the attached policy memorandum, the authorities indicate that Madagascar would not entertain any further initiative in this direction. As to the status of existing promissory notes, the authorities doubted their legality, since the statutory provisions governing public borrowing had not been met; however, some litigation might arise, especially in respect of notes issued by the Central Bank, for which the protection provided by statutory requirements was less comprehensive. Finally, in order to strengthen their internal controls, the authorities have decided to update and reissue the basic regulations, dating back to 1963, that govern the budget process, and to reactivate the statutes that provide for annual parliamentary approval of audited government accounts. 4. Structural policies The authorities recalled that in the summer of 1994 they had prepared a medium-term policy statement for the period 1994-97, in close cooperation with the staffs of the Fund and the World Bank, which laid out the principles of their structural adjustment policy. The main features of the program were: (a) to terminate the State's commercial activities and to focus instead on its role in establishing a sound market environment; (b) to emphasize investment in infrastructure, human resource development, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - poverty alleviation; (c) to strengthen Madagascar's institutional capacity; and (d) to foster the decentralization of government services. The staff welcomed the liberal orientation of this program, and suggested that the Government could show a clear commitment to reform through the implementation of key measures in various sectors during the next few months: the full liberalization of the vanilla sector; the adoption of a new legal framework for the petroleum sector, as well as a new banking law (including authorization to everrtually privatize the two state- owned banks); and measures to further libera'lize the air transportation and telecommunication sectors. Also, in the next few months, the investment code could be revised; a commission could prepare a legal framework for the authorities' privatization program, and establish a list of enterprises to be privatized with a tentative timetable; and bids for the privatization of the petroleum refinery could be issued. Efforts to strengthen Madagascar's institutional capacity are being supported by the World Bank under a capacity-building project that focuses on improvements in budget management, the judicial system, and the statistical data base, mainly the national accounts. Although there is no need fo-r further downsizing the civil service, given the progress made in this area since the late 1980s following World Bank recommendations, there is a need to attract and retain competent staff and to facilitate redeployment within the public sector. In addition, technical assistance would be necessary in the areas of public expenditure management, tax and customs administration, bank supervision, monetary policy, private sector development, and public enterprise reform. Moreover, decentralization has begun for public investment and social expenditure, but there is a concern that prioritization of decentralized expenditure may not be optimal in all cases. 5. Social impact To alleviate the social impact of their program, in particular the recent sharp price increases, ihe. authorities said that they would provide for the implementation of a targeted and permanent safety net instead of universal subsidies. A primary target of the safety net involved the urban poor who could be reached through stepped-up implementation of small, labor- intensive, urban rehabilitation projects, which were in place under various programs set up by the World Bank and other donors, such as France, the European Union, and Japan. The second target comprised specific needs of a wider population, both urban and rural--that is, access to medicines and to primary education, for which additional appropriations were to be provided in the 1995 supplementary budget. 1/ I./' The education and health sectors are expected to receive FMG 11.2 bil- .; ,J-- .).a& out of the additional current expenditure in the 1995 supplement- ,, -‘; oudget , and social aid, FMG 7.6 billion.

Statistical issues Monetary statistics continue to be a priority area for improvement, as deficiencies in the collection and presentation of data were confirmed during the discussions. Presentation problems and inconsistencies were alsc found in other areas, particularly in the national accounts. To this end, therefore, major efforts are required to assist the authorities in effectively improving Madagascar's data base. Fund technical assistance is to be provided in the near future to improve the monetary statistics. It would also be important to consider the possibility of broadening the emphasis in statistical development. Despite the existing deficiencies, the authorities remain committed to sending monthly to the staff a set of indicators for the effective monitoring of economic and financial developments in Madagascar. IV. Medium-Term Economic Outlook Tables 1-4 include a medium-term scenario for 1995-98 prepared by the staff, which reflects the authorities' intention to pursue firm financial policies coupled with bold structural measures. The scenario is primarily designed as a tool to explore the conditions under which Madagascar could reverse a decades-old trend of falling real incomes, under the constraints described in Section II. It also suggests that Madagascar can make strides toward external viability, although it will not be possible to eliminate reliance on exceptional financing within the horizon of this scenario. The scenario projects real GDP growth of 3.4 percent in 1995, rising gradually to almost 5.0 percent by 1998, underpinned by an expansion of total gross investment to 17.5 percent of GDP, from 11 percent in 1992-94. Although private investment would grow by about 2 percentage points of GDP during the horizon of the scenario, public investment would account for most of the investment effort, given the massive need for investment in infrastructure and health and education facilities. Eventually, the investment effort required to support a 6 percent annual real GDP growth rate (roughly the rate needed to absorb the labor force increase and to reduce the large number of unemployed) could be close to 30 percent of GDP. The scenario also assumes an important expansion in domestic savings, from 5 percent of GDP in 1995 (compared with 2.7 percent in 1994) to about 9 percent by 1998. This improvement would initially come from higher government savings; private savings are expected to improve significantly only after 1997 as banking intermediation deepens, positive real interest rates bear fruit, and saving for housing increases. Although the rise in domestic savings would generally outpace the expansion in private invest- ment, Madagascar will continue to require a significant net inflow of external financing throughout the period to support the growth strategy. New financing would need to be on very concessional terms, as the face value of total external debt would reach about 155 percent of GDP by 1998; measured on net present value terms, however, owing to the projected Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - concessional character of new flows, the debt ratio would be much less than this figure. In the external sector, following the substantial increase of the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) in-1995, the deficit could be expected to decline to less than 12 percent of GDP in 1998. This would require, on average, an annual export volume growth of about 5 percent, particularly for nontraditional exports. The need for vigorous growth ;'.n the volume of exports is underscored by the unfavorable outlook for Madagascar's terms of trade after 1995, which is due particularly to the expected decline of about 30 percent in the international price of coffee through 1998. At the same time, the growth in the import volume is projected to be below that in domestic economic activity, because imports of foodscuffs should decline as a result of the projected expansion in domestic production, especially rice. On the fiscal side, despite a strong recovery and expansion of public investment, the overall deficit (excluding grants) would return to an average of 10 percent of GDP over the medium term, from over 12 percent in 1994-95. This improvement would require a significant strengthening of revenue performance, as no reduction in current expenditure ratios is envisaged. Tax receipts would increase from 7.3 percent of GDP in 1994 to almost 12 percent by 1998, despite the projected decline in the export tax rate on vanilla from the present 35 percent to 20 percent by 1998. Thus, about half of the improvement in the tax revenue is accounted for by an expansion in direct and indirect taxes; the VAT single tax rate would decline from the present 25 percent to 18 percent, and its tax base would expand from less than 7 percent of nominal GDP today to about 13 percent by 1998. At that time, the VAT as a percentage of GDP would be slightly above 2 percent and would account for about 20 percent of tax revenue. V. Staff ArIDraid After a year of high and accelerating inflation, the Malagasy authorities have formulated a program that recognizes the urgency of achieving price stabilization. A key corrective action has been the elimination of the ad hoc tax exemptions that had been explicitly or tacitly granted to foodstuffs, oil products, and vanilla exports in 1994, and had caused a sharp acceleration in monetary creation. Accordingly, retail prices for flour and oil products have recently been adjusted. The staff welcomes these actions, which should help to bring inflation under control, restore a sound investment climate, and improve Madagascar's medium-term growth prospects. In view of the narrow tax base, the authorities' determination to resist any ad hoc tax exemptions in the future is critically important. Tax administration has also suffered in the past year from frequent changes in tax laws. This is a source of concern, because further increases in tax revenues are needed to support the provision of government services. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - A continuous and steady effort to improve tax administration is thus essential for any credible medium-term fiscal strategy in Madagascar. The new statutes of the Central Bank explicitly recognize the central role of monetary policy in subduing inflation. The strong expansion of the money supply through 1994 was not consistent with this objective. By contrast, the programmed slowdown in monetary growth in 1995 should make it possible for Madagascar to move onto a lower inflation path, while still providing adequate financing to the private sector. This policy needs to be implemented with determination if its credibility is to be established. In addition, it will require a significant improvement in the efficiency and flexibility of monetary instruments. To this end, an early solution to the problems of the two state-owned banks will be necessary to give the Central Bank greater leeway to make active use of interest rate policy in pursuing its quantitative targets. The shift of the exchange system since May 1994 to a free interbank market for trade and most current account transactions has been helpful in removing trade restrictions and reducing exchange market distortions. The staff strongly supports this arrangement, which implies that the exchange rate per se is not an immediate objective of government policy, and welcomes the Government's emphasis on controlling inflation as an indirect approach to stabilizing the exchange rate. The staff is concerned, however, that all demands in the foreign exchange market are not met strictly on a same-day basis. Whereas the present system undoubtedly has spared Madagascar the distortions inherent in previous restrictive practices, the staff urges the authorities to make progress toward further liberalization and a better functioning of the market. The floating of the exchange rate has allowed the earlier real appreciation to be reversed. The staff would look to higher productivity as the main channel for further improvements in competitiveness. To this end, major increases in investment should be facilitated by the return to price stability in a liberal market environment, and by increased domestic savings, mainly as a result of strengthened fiscal policies. The staff notes in this respect that the debt overhang remains a major impediment to sustained growth. The authorities are updating their medium-term policy statement drafted in the summer of 1994. The staff welcomes the proposals for the continuing liberalization of the economy contained in that document, which will help ensure a supportive environment for the needed investment effort and should become the base for developing a policy framework paper. A timetable to implement these proposals would be firmed up in the context of an eventual ESAF-supported program. However, in the next few months, the Government is expected to show a clear commitment to reform through the implementation of key measures in various sectors.

The Government's new program is a welcome signal of the change in policy course; its rigorous implementation would demonstrate the renewed commitment to adjustment and reform. Madagascar maintains exchange restrictions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2 (see Appendix I). It also has exchange restrictions that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, as evidenced by the accumulation of external payments arrears. As the authorities have expressed no firm intention or timetable for their elimination, the staff does not recommend Executive Board approval for the restrictions that are subject to Article VIII, but urges the authorities to remove them as soon as possible. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Madagascar take place on the usual 12-month cycle.

Exchange Svstem and Exchanee Rate Arrangement Madagascar. continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2. Both ceilings on availability of foreign exchange for residents traveling or studying abroad, and ceilings on the amounts that foreigners working in Madagascar may transfer abroad, give rise to exchange restrictions under Article XIV. Since 1982, when the peg to the French franc was abandoned, the exchange rate has been generally managed flexibly with reference to a basket of several currencies. However, by end-1991, the authorities discontinued exchange rate adjustments to offset inflation differentials. As a result, the real effective exchange rate appreciated sharply. Since May 9, 1994, the Malagasy franc has been allowed to float. The midpoint exchange rate in terms of the U.S. dollar at end-March 1995 was FMG 4,160.21 = US$l. VIII. Last Article IV and XIV Consultations The last Article IV consultation discussions with Madagascar were held in Antananarivo during the period August 5-19, 1993; the consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on November 24, 1993 (SM/93/235). Madagascar is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article XIV consultation (SM/94/302) was concluded on January 4, 1995, at which time the following decision was adopted: 1. The Fund takes this decision in concluding the 1994 Article XIV consultation with Madagascar. ;! . As described in SM/93/231, Madagascar maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2.

Introduction The Malagasy economy must achieve strong and lasting growth in order to meet the needs of the population. To this end, the Government undertook major structural reforms in 1994. Its current goals are to control inflation so as to create an environment conducive to the development and success of the reforms undertaken and to continue with the preparation of a program that could be supported by the International Monetary Fund's enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF). II. Recent Economic Developments Early in 1994, the Government drew up a medium-term policy statement for the 1994-97 period. In May 1994, the exchange and payments system was reformed along the lines of that paper. By floating the Malagasy franc, it was possible to eliminate all import restrictions, liberalize most current transactions, and authorize the opening of accounts in foreign exchange by residents and nonresidents. Furthermore, the Central Bank raised its base rate (taux directeur) and reserve requirement ratios, while a value-added tax was introduced effective September 1, 1994. However, these efforts were thwarted by serious budgetary slippages. The Government effectively granted numerous subsidies and tax exemptions for foodstuffs and agricultural inputs and financed imports of these goods. In addition, the price at the pump of petroleum products was not adjusted and the corresponding excise taxes could not be collected. The cost of these measures is estimated at about FMG 272 billion in 1994. The resulting additional financing requirement doubled the rate of money creation, causing inflation to soar and the exchange rate to sharply depreciate. As a result, the economic and financial situation deteriorated in 1994. The pace of inflation stepped up, with the annual rate moving from less than 10 percent at end-1993 to over 50 percent by end-1994. Though the trade deficit was reduced in SDR terms, especially as a result of the rise in coffee prices, new external payments arrears were accumulated. The growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) remained very weak and far lower than population growth. The nominal exchange rate, which strongly depreciated I/ Policy memorandum transmitted to the Fund on the occasion of the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions.

However, another sharp depreciation occurred in January 1995, while free access to the market was impeded by the emergence of queuing. During the entire period, a source of uncertainty in the conduct of economic and financial policy was the attempt to obtain "parallel financing" for Madagascar, which eventually did not materialize. The Government has clearly stated its opposition to any new initiatives along these lines. III. Economic and Financial Policv in 1995 In the context of a free exchange system, the objectives of the Government's economic and financial policy in 1995 are to lower the inflation rate to 15 percent by the end of the period and to eliminate all external payments arrears. The Government believes that this policy will yield 3-4 percent growth in real GDP and stabilize the exchange rate in real terms. The Government's program is based on vigorous measures to improve tax revenue by more than 2 percent of GDP, mainly through realistic pricing anld broadening the tax base. To this end, the Fiscal Monopoly Office (RBeie malzache des mononoles fiscaux) (RMMF) has discontinued flour subsidies as of February 13, 1995, and will be completely dissolved as of July 1995. The royalties, duties, and taxes paid by revenue-producing monopolies will continue to be collected. An amended schedule of fuel prices became effective on February 23. It introduced a price setting method that adds an excise tax, variable by product, to the costs, and to the recovery of arrears on excise that SOLIMA, the distributor, was unable to transfer back under the old schedule. In addition, the Giovernment no longer grants any ad hoc tax exemptions on imports or on vanilla exports. Finally, the Government also intends to accelerate the recovery of tax arrears and strengthen tax administration, especially customs administration. On the expenditure side, to make more efficient use of available resources, the Government will pay particular attention to monitoring budgetary allocations to basic health and p,rimary education services. Similarly, the ceiling on the public investment program (PIP) will be raised to FMG 1,131.4 billion and the program's composition has been revised in accordance with the guidelines of the medium-term policy statement. Both the PIP and revenue revisions will be submitted to Parliament for approval in a supplementary budget law. All in all, the overall balance of government financial operations, excluding external debt service and capital expenditure financed with external resources, will be considerably improved, moving from a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP in 1994 to a surplus equivalent to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1995. This recovery will be bolstered by the settlement of external arrears and the resumption of donor inflows, thereb:g enabling the Government to reduce its reliance on the banking system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - ATTACHMENT Monetary policy will contribute to this effort by limiting the growth of the money supply to 15 percent on a December to December basis. Given the Government's retrenchment, this objective is compatible with growth in credit to the economy on the order of 20 percent. The Central Bank will initially continue to impose credit ceilings on a bank-by-bank basis. It will maintain the interest rate structure at an appropriate level, based on international rates and the expected inflation differential. The Central Bank could auction remunerated deposits. The Treasury will conduct an '.n- depth review of the policy of opening accounts in commercial banks with a view to its rationalization. Better control of money and credit will be possible in the short term through the reorganization of the accounts and management of two state-owned banks, and through the replenishment of their capital to levels that c:omply with the legislative and regulatory provisions in force in Madagascar. This will create the conditions conducive to development of the money market and to the transition to indirect credit control. The proper functioning of the interbank foreign exchange market continues to be a focus ok the Government':. policy. All transactors, without exception, will be required to rep.itriate export proceeds. -yj-* i:. authorities will ensure that the market rt1.i.s smoothly. Long lines wi;,i 1101: be tolerated; moreover, access to foreign exchange will not be selcftive. IV. Social Asoects The Government is aware that, in 1994, tax exemptions intended to protect consumers and rural producers considerably worsened the imbalal:*:es in government finance and seriously undermined the Government's credibility. For this reason, as indicated above, it has decided to grant no further exemptions or subsidies for the purpose of holding down prices. At the saps time, in order to cushion the anticipated impact on urban workers and unemployed city-dwellers of the return to realistic pricing and transparency of the market for mass consumption goods, the Government has decided to implement accompanying measures. With the support of the country's partners, it has set about strengthening labor-intensive projects and is promoting the activities of NGOs and religious organizations working to improve the welfare of the most vulnerable groups. Additional budgetary allocations of FMG 20 billion were instituted to enhance the operating resources of primary schools and the effectiveness of health districts. Furthermore, an allocation of FMG 30 billion was added to the appropriatiuns for wages and salaries in order to cover a special bonus to be awarded to civil servants, effective January 1, 1995. The private sector will also be encouraged to reach a consensus with labor representatives on studying appropriate measures called for by the Government's decisions.

External Financing The Government has attributed the highest priority to restoring normal financial relations with its creditors, However, the situation of the Government's finances does not allow it to meet all its past due and current obligations. For this reason, until such time as agreement can be reached on a comprehensive adjustment program, which would permit a Paris Club r.scheduling, every effort will be made to clear arrears to multilateral creditors and bilateral debts that cannot be rescheduled, and comparable treatment of creditors will be scrupulously observed. TO put an end to attempts to raise financial resources on the international capital markets, the Government has withdrawn all travel documents issued by the Government and used by various Malagasy and foreign agents to conduct financial transactions on behalf of the Republic of E:adagascar, To further strengthen the protection of public funds, the Government has also undertaken to draft organic legislation on budget laws: and to initiate an in-depth examination of the laws on the Central Bank of Madagascar with a view to revising its charter, if need be, in order to maintain its credibility. Annual auditing by the government accounting office will become effective once the audit corps is reactivated and the laws closing the budgets of previous fiscal years have been put to a vote in Parliament. The Government has contacted its partners to present its program to them. It is convinced that the support obtainable from bilateral creditors in the form of external debt service relief, and financing from bilateral and multilateral donors in the form of new grants and highly concessional loans, will enable it to :fully implement the program and achieve its objectives. VI. Policv Monitoring For purposes of monitoring this policy, the following variables, namely (a) the cumulative change in external payments arrears; (b) advances to the Treasury from the banking system; (c) the net domestic assets of the Central Bank; and (d) external nonconcessional borrowing, will be regarded as quantitative benchmarks. Broad money and tax revenue will be used as indicators, as shown in the attached table. Restoring account integrity and rehabilitating the management of the two problem public banks, liberalization of the flour trade, and preparation of organic legislation on budget laws will be structural indicators. VII. Structural Adjustment 'The Government has decided to proceed forthwith with the preparation of a timetable of measures to be implemented in 1995, in accordance with the medium-term policy statement. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - ATTACHMENT These measures include, in particular, the decrease in the Government's exposure to the banking sector, reform of the investment code, and the introduction of structures and legal provisions aimed at the privatization of industrial and commercial public enterprises. They also include the liberalization of the petroleum products, vanilla, foodstuffs, transportation, and telecommunications sectors. Directives on preparation of the 1996 budget and the 1996-98 PIP will be forwarded to the ministries and institutions to ensure that the medium- term guidelines set out in the policy statement will be applied. Decentralization plans will also be based on the principles defined in that paper.
