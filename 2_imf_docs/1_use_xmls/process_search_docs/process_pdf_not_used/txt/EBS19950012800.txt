Background 1. Introduction A staff team 1/ visited Minsk from June 2-16 to conduct the 1995 Article IV Consultation and negotiate an economic program for the period July 1, 1995-June 30, 1996 which could be supported by the use of Fund resources under the stand-by arrangement. The discussions were held primarily with the Prime Minister (Mr. Chigir), the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of external relations (Mr. Mjasnikovich), the Minister of Finance (Mr. DyW , the Minister of Economy (Mr. Badei), the Chairman of the National Bank of Belarus (Mr. Bogdankevich), and the main economic advisor of the President (Mr. Kapitula). u The last Article IV Consultation with Belarus was concluded on July 18, 1994. At that time, Directors noted with deep concern the deterioration in Belarus' economic performance and emphasized that the I/ Consisting of Messrs.

They urged the new Government to clearly signal to the international community its determination to stabilize the economy and accelerate market reforms. On January 30, 1995, the Executive Board approved for Belarus a second purchase under the Systemic Transformation Facility (STF) in support of a program of stabilization and market reforms for 1995, but a request for a stand-by arrangement could not be considered at that time because of an uncovered financing gap. Discussions in Minsk during March to address slippages in program implementation on several fronts were inconclusive, and the judgement of the staff at that time was that Belarus needed to establish a better track-record in stabilizing the economy and implementing consistently market reforms before recommending approval of further Fund financial assistance. In the attached letter of intent dated August 1, 1995, the Belarussian authorities describe their economic policy program for the twelve months period July 1, 1995-June 30, 1996 and request in support of this program a stand-by arrangement from the Fund for an amount equivalent to SDR 196.3 million (70 percent of quota). In his letter to the Managing Director (copy also attached), President Lukashenko affirms his personal support for the program and commitment to its full implementation. Purchases under the stand-by arrangement would take place according to the conditions stated in Table 1. Assuming that all purchases are made as envisaged, total Fund credit outstanding to Belarus at the end of the program would be SDR 336.5 million (120 percent of quota) (Table 2). Key economic data are made available in a timely fashion in the case of Belarus, and there has been steady improvement in their quality. However, in a number of areas data problems exist. Trade statistics have continued to be unreliable, with substantial discrepancies among data sources. National accounts data also appear to suffer from incomplete reporting by enterprises, and there are problems with classification of government expenditures and reconciliation of financing. Besides assistance from the IMF, the Belarussian authorities have sought additional financial support from other multilateral and bilateral creditors for 1995 and beyond. A meeting of creditors and donors was held at the Fund headquarters in December 1994. The staff intends to report on the outcome of another such meeting before Board approval of the program to confirm the commitments of support so far and to cover a small residual financing gap. A World Bank mission to conduct early discussions on a Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) overlapped with the end of the Fund mission in Minsk; a pre-appraisal mission for the SAL is scheduled for early September.

Macroeconomic stabilization Inflation in the first four months of 1995 was much higher than expected under the program (Chart 1). The impact of decisions to liberalize food and agricultural prices at the beginning of the year appears to have been greater than expected (also suggesting that the extent of remaining formal or informal price controls at the end of 1994 had been underestimated). 2/ In addition, the larger than targeted expansion in broad and base money sustained excess demand for some time. However, monthly inflation abated rapidly from April, and reached 2.5 percent in June, a development which coincided with a recovery in real money in the second quarter of 1995. Reflecting the increased attractiveness of the domestic currency, rubel money growth outpaced that of foreign currency denominated balances. Output developments in early 1995 are consistent with a substantial reduction in aggregate domestic demand, to which tighter financial policies contributed significantly. Economic activity has continued to contract in early 1995, with the decline in GDP estimated at 11 percent in the first half of the year (from the same period of the previous year) (Chart 2). This decline coincided, however, with a much better external trade performance, as the merchandise trade deficit shrank to less than US$160 million, compared to almost US$400 million in the same period of the previous year. This almost exclusively reflected a significant increase in exports to non-FSU markets. The large overruns of program targets for base money and NDA of the banking system mainly resulted from the depositing within, and sale to, the banking system by resident households and enterprises of unexpectedly large amounts of foreign exchange which supported an expansion of credit to enterprises. In addition to larger export receipts, these inflows reflected a portfolio shift of residents away from foreign exchange previously held outside the domestic banking system at home or abroad. The NBB chose to accumulate more foreign exchange reserves rather than let the nominal exchange rate appreciate, but failed to sterilize the resulting monetary impact before mid-March when it first increased the mandatory reserve requirement on rubel deposits. u This failure, rather than an inadequacy u Macroeconomic and financial policy developments in the second half of 1994 and early 1995 are covered in greater detail in the accompanying background paper. 2/ The adjustment in tariffs for household services and utilities also had an impact on the rise in prices; but this had been anticipated in the program, and was in any case fairly small. 1/ Additional steps to mop up excess liquidity in the second quarter of 1995 included the issuance of NBB securities and a large time deposit of the Sberbank with the NBB.

The program limits for the increase in net domestic assets (NDA) and international reserve targets (NIR) of the NBB, as well as the limits on the government deficit and its financing by the banking system, for end-March and end-June were met, u except for a small overrun of NDA at end-June. Meeting the fiscal targets was made possible by the general government's running a surplus in the first quarter--reflecting in particular strict containment of cash expenditures-- and the NBB's providing virtually no refinancing to banks in the second quarter. The cash deficit of the general government in the first half of the year was less than 1 percent of GDP. The pursuit by the authorities of an active interest rate policy under the program, including the introduction of minimum deposit rates positive in real terms, in conjunction with the very tight central bank refinance policy, played a key role in encouraging the observed reflow of foreign exchange to the banking system, and allowing the authorities to maintain a stable nominal exchange rate (Chart 3). b. Market reforms Further progress was made under the program toward establishing free prices, including for food and agricultural products as already mentioned, and toward strengthening market mechanisms for the allocation of NBB credit through auctions. u With a view to eliminating price distortions and reducing subsidies, tariffs for household services and utilities were raised in February and April to cover 20 and then 40 percent of costs. Many discretionary tax exemptions granted in 1994 were not renewed, and the first phase in establishing a Treasury was completed. Furthermore, steps were taken to liberalize further the operations of the foreign exchange market and to remove export taxes and nontariff restrictions. Implementation of other systemic reforms, however, fell far short of the program's targets, especially in the area of privatization and enterprise reform. Legislation extending property rights to state farms was approved by the Supreme Soviet in April, but that giving property rights of land to juridical persons (agreed by the President) has not yet been submitted to the Supreme Soviet. A revised bankruptcy law (also agreed by the President) is still waiting consideration by the Supreme Soviet. Finally, the authorities took a number of decisions early in the year to impose greater control on economic transactions, which, while generally taken with the intention to deter abuses, turned out to be inconsistent with market reforms. This was especially the case with the suspension of I/ By a large margin for NIR. 2/ The second STF target of extending at least 30 percent of NBB refinancing credit through auctions in the first quarter was met, but that of 40 percent in the second quarter was not.

II. Overview of Discussions At the outset of the discussions, the Belarussian authorities made it clear that they intended to continue implementing policies that in most recent months had begun to show remarkable success in reducing inflation and improving the international reserve position of the country. They noted, however, that efforts toward macroeconomic stabilization had resulted in many stress points in the economy, including a significant rise in interenterprise, tax, and budget expenditure arrears, which needed to be dealt with. Reflecting a decline in payment compliance by households for communal services, there had also been a resumption of gas payment arrears to Russia in recent months; and Belarus had fallen behind in its debt service payments to Germany due to a lack of resources among enterprises. The authorities were concerned by the continued decline in economic activity, which they attributed to a lack of demand; and they questioned whether their policies had not been too restrictive. They also noted that a broad political consensus for a substantial acceleration in market reforms remained elusive. The mission expressed satisfaction at the developments of recent months and welcomed the authorities' intention to continue with stabilization. It emphasized, however, the need for consistency between stabilization targets and underlying policies, particularly with regard to increasing the financial discipline of enterprises and funding government expenditure appropriations. It argued that, with inflation still in double digits on an annual basis, the apparent lack of demand was more likely to be sectoral than general, reflecting structural changes in both demand and supply (costs) conditions. Much looser financial policies would only worsen inflation without helping in a sustainable way sectors which needed to downsize or restructure. In this context, the staff highlighted the importance of the authorities' adopting a fully supportive attitude toward private sector development, upon which the prospects for an early recovery in economic activity depended. The authorities were generally in agreement with this assessment by the staff, and emphasized their intention to take measures to limit access by insolvent enterprises to new sources of financing, and in particular contain the accumulation of new interenterprise arrears. I-J At the same time, they intended to implement steps to resolve the problem of the stock of arrears, including through netting, without money emission. Increasing the financial discipline of enterprises was also a major theme of a speech I/ In percent of (quarterly annualized) GDP, however, payables remained virtually unchanged in the first quarter of 1995 compared to the last quarter of 1994, at around 45 percent.

L/ Furthermore, the mission noted that the letter of intent, which was then under discussion, contradicted in a few instances other statements made by the President in that same speech. It stressed that, even though the President now supported the policies of the letter of intent, the credibility of the program would require consistent and supportive public pronouncements in the future. With regard to exchange rate policy, the President and Prime Minister strongly supported the stabilization of the nominal exchange rate vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, in a situation of significant accumulation of international reserves since early 1995. But concerns were expressed about the impact of the more than 100 percent real appreciation of the rubel in the first half of the year (Chart 4) on competitiveness. The staff saw merit in pursuing a more flexible exchange rate policy at this stage. It shared concerns about the sustainability of the balance of payments once the process of portfolio shift would slow down, and stressed the need to avoid a situation where an abrupt change in the exchange rate would be required in the future. The authorities are expected to depart from their current policy of maintaining a stable exchange rate and to let the rate depreciate modestly when the pressures on the foreign exchange market reverse. III. Obiectives and Policies under the 1995/96 Prozram The broad objectives of the Belarussian authorities' economic program for 1995/96 are to make further progress toward reaching price stability, achieving a sustainable balance of payments position, and establishing a market economy, with a view to laying a foundation for sustainable growth. The policies which the Belarussian authorities intend to pursue in order to achieve these objectives are detailed in paragraphs 7'through 32 of their letter of intent. This section highlights the underlying macroeconomic and financial framework, and summarizes the authorities' policies in this context. 1. Financial oolicies a. Overall objectives Under the program, financial policies will be geared toward containing the rate of inflation from a projected 6 percent in July to no more than u As it turned out, only a very limited amount of mutual arrears were netted at the clearing which took place at the end of June.

Financial policies will also be consistent with avoiding any further rise in the real exchange rate vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar in the program period, as it is likely that the recent real appreciation has eliminated most of the undervaluation of the exchange rate in the current environment. Given this, financial and wage policies will have to be sufficiently tight to reduce inflation of nontraded goods so as to achieve the overall inflation target. Until labor shedding accelerates, and an improvement in productivity materializes, further increases in U.S. dollar wages (now reaching more than LlS$65 a month on average) could hamper the competitiveness and profitability of export sectors, taking into account the many other elements of labor costs and the impact of the some 30 percent deterioration in the terms of trade since 1991 (Charts 5 and 5a). Accordingly, a supportive wage policy is also assumed under the program, with average wages in the public sector in fact targeted to decline modestly in both U.S. dollar and real terms (i.e. when deflated by the CPI). The export performance is, nevertheless, expected to deteriorate in the second half of 1995 before recovering somewhat from early 1996. Partly as a result, the authorities have revised their estimate of the decline in real GDP in 1995 from 7 to 14 percent. Finally, financial policies allow for the phased elimination before the end of 1995 of external payments arrears for gas deliveries from Russia accumulated earlier this year (as agreed with the Government of the Russian Federation, the stock outstanding at end-August 1994 will be regularized in a medium- to long-term framework, under terms still to be worked out by a bilateral commission). b. Monetarv policy A flexible interest rate policy (paragraph 19) aimed at maintaining positive real interest rates will continue to play a key role in mobilizing rubel deposits within the banking system. A projected broad money growth of some 37 percent in the remainder of the year will be consistent with velocity on a seasonally adjusted basis increasing slightly in the third quarter before declining somewhat in the fourth quarter (Table 5 and Chart 6). The staff views the projection of higher velocity in the short run as realistic given the uncertainty related to the implications of the surge in money growth in June and seasonality factors. Base money growth is projected to be somewhat lower than broad money growth in the remainder of the year, reflecting a small increase in the money multiplier.

Most of it will finance the general government, with the remainder coinciding mainly with a modest Rbl 250 billion provision for direct financing of agricultural procurement. The limits for the expansion in NDA of the banking system in the remainder of 1995 (paragraph 20) imply that net financial savings intermediation through the banking system will amount to some 7 percent of GDP. Including other net foreign financing of the balance payments, total domestic and foreign savings in the remainder of 1995 would amount to 9.1 percent of GDP. The same figures are projected at 4.5 percent and 7.7 percent of GDP for 1996. Under the program, the authorities will use the sale of NBB securities as short term instruments for sterilization policy, while mandatory reserve requirements are to be adjusted and unified (paragraph 21). Auctions of NBB securities will be coordinated with refinance credit volumes to ensure consistent overall liquidity management. C. Fiscal stance Containment of the cash deficit of the general government to 4.6 percent of GDP excluding privatization receipts (paragraph 11) in the second half of 1995, consistent with a ceiling of 3.2 percent of GDP for the year as a whole will limit the absorption of domestic and foreign financial savings by Government to about half the total available in the second half of 1995 (Table 6 and Chart 7). Excluding the counterparts of the financing from the EU channeled through the central bank, domestic bank financing of the deficit will be limited to 3.5 percent of GDP in the remainder of the year, or 2.4 percent of GDP for the year as a whole. The authorities' intention to introduce a 1996 budget aimed at limiting the general government deficit in 1996 to no more than 2 percent of GDP is consistent with limiting the absorption by Government of available domestic and foreign financial savings to just above one fourth. Measures to achieve the above targets include, on the revenue side, an increase in certain excises, limiting tax exemptions, and strengthening the collection of taxes and social security contributions; on the expenditure side, containing subsidies and net lending, the wage bill, and other discretionary outlays, as well as limiting, pensions and other expenditures of the Pension Fund (paragraphs 11, 12, and 13). However, provisions are being made for a limited compensation for the increases in tariffs for household services and utilities, targeted to nonworking pensioners, the unemployed, and families with many children. lJ EU disbursements are expected to be to the central bank for on-lending to the Government.

While the authorities were only willing to make marginal downward revisions to their revenue projections, after review, they agreed to identify an expenditure contingency in the state budget of some 2 percent of GDP, including interest subsidies, net lending, and capital expenditure. Within this contingency, which is larger than the Fund staff's assessment of the risk to revenues, certain expenditures will be implemented only if revenues do not fall short of projections. 2. Structural oolicies Steps taken at the outset of the program in the area of price liberalization (paragraph 8) have resulted in limiting price regulation to a group of some 50 "natural" monopolies and preventing local authorities from interfering with the principle of free prices. u The increase in tariffs for household services and utilities (paragraph 9) effected in early July has raised average cost recovery to just above 60 percent. As a result, average households will be paying on a monthly basis this summer about US$4 more (for a total of some US$13), which is significant given the average money wage income of only US$65 per worker. u Cost recovery is to be further raised to 80 percent at the beginning of 1996. Further progress in the direction of more market-oriented monetary and fiscal systems is to be made under the program (paragraphs 22, 23, 24, and 25). In the monetary area, this is to be accomplished by (i) a phased increase in the proportion of NBB refinancing extended through credit auctions to reach 80 percent by the end of 1995--with the basic refinance rate applying to the remainder; (ii) steps to allow for a sharp reduction in the amount of directed credit to agriculture, which will also be supported by structural changes in the procurement system, including reduction in the size of centralized state purchases; and (iii) measures to strengthen and implement more effectively bank supervision and address the issue of problem banks with weak portfolios and capital bases. w With regard to the latter, the authorities are keen to receive further technical assistance. 1/ The authorities stressed, however, that a number of enterprises continue to abuse dominant local market positions linked to the old structure of production and distribution. While they recognized that price controls do not address the problem, they intend to use more effectively other anti-monopoly measures. u Winter rates will be higher by about US$6, for a total of some US$20. y The NBB is implementing a short timetable for increasing the minimum capital requirement of banks to ECU 2 million by end-1995, with the intention to bring about a consolidation of the banking system into fewer, larger, and sounder banks. For further details on the results of this endeavor so far, see accompanying background paper.

There has already been a substantial deepening of the foreign exchange market in Belarus, as evidenced by the fact that the average volume of transactions at the auction in the second quarter of 1995 was some 2 l/2 times that of the same period the previous year. The elimination of the remaining surrender requirements, the broadening of the interbank foreign exchange market, and the elimination of minimum and maximum prices for exports and imports at the outset of the program (paragraph 15) are further significant steps in the direction of a comprehensive liberalization of (paragraphs 15-18). These measures are expected to increase efficiency in foreign exchange allocation and to support a strengthening of the balance of payments situation. While a monetary union with the Russian Federation is no longer a considered option, the authorities are implementing customs union arrangements which will result in the el,lmination of taxes on trade between the two countries and adoption of a common external tariff structure. L,/ Other svstemic reforms to be implemented in the program period (paragraphs 26-32) have three broad objectives: (i) to further reduce barriers to private sector development; (ii) to implement a critical mass of enterprise corporatization and privatization which, while relatively modest, will give a clear impetus to the process; and (iii) to increase the pressure on enterprises to become financially more responsible and to restructure, including by giving greater credibility to the threat of bankruptcy and liquidation, while strictly limiting accmess to financial resources for insolvent enterprises. Legislation granting individual members of state and collective farms transferrable rights to the land they share will, when approved, also constitute a decisive step toward restructuring agriculture. 3. Balance of oavments outlook. Dronram financing. and caDacitv to resay Following a significant improvement in the first half of 1995, the external current account deficit in U.S. dollars is projected to worsen somewhat in the second half of 1995, reflecting the expected temporary weakening of the export performance as a delayed response to the substantial real appreciation of the exchange rate. 2J At the same time, the capital account before gap financing is expected to turn negative largely due to higher amortization payments and the planned reduction in external arrears I-J For further details on steps to effect such a customs union, see accompanying background paper. 2J Certain export contracts for tractors in early 1995 were also of an exceptional nature.

While debt payments should be less in the first half of 1996, the external current account deficit is not expected to improve until the second half of the year, in part because of a projected further deterioration in terms of trade based on the expectation of world market prices for energy. Therefore, despite the assumption of a continued contraction in import volumes, imports in U.S. dollar terms are projected to increase somewhat in 1996 in comparison with 1995. For the program period, the resulting financing needs after anticipated Fund purchases are assessed at US$315 million. Disbursements from pledges made at the December 1994 donors' meeting and from additional indications of support made in recent months by bilateral and multilateral creditors and donors, including the EU, are currently projected at US$283 million for the program period. The small residual financing gap is expected to be covered at the forthcoming meeting of creditors. While prospects for exports in the remainder of 1995 and early 1996 are uncertain, a determined implementation of the program described above should result in a resumption in the growth of exports soon after, particularly if labor costs remain attractive in comparison with neighboring countries. At the same time, the scope for savings in energy consumption and imports remains substantial, making it possible to project a fairly rapid improvement in the external current account over the medium term despite the needs of restructuring (Table 7). Provided that there is further consolidation of the fiscal stance, and the pace of structural reforms accelerates, this should be consistent with a resumption of growth in economic activity from 1997. Assuming a conducive environment, there is scope for a significant increase in direct foreign investment in Belarus in coming years. In conjunction with declining external current account deficits, such inflows should be instrumental in limiting financing gaps over the medium term. Under these conditions, the annual financing gaps are projected to average US$325 million during 1997-2000 (US$240 million before repayments to the Fund), and to decline rapidly thereafter, consistent with a stabilization of Belarus' external debt. Assuming continued progress with stabilization and market reforms, Belarus should be able to attract bilateral and multilateral financing to cover these gaps (it should be noted that only a modest growth in medium- and long-term capital disbursements has been included above the line). If these .flows were not forthcoming, the adjustment effort will have to be stepped up. Given the relatively low level of external debt service payments at the outset of the program, the financing gaps in coming years should be manageable, with external debt obligations in percent of exports peaking at less than 20 percent in 2000. While acknowledging the fragility of Belarus' balance of payments prospects, and the large uncertainties underlying the medium term projections, the staff is of the view that Belarus should be able to meet its obligations to the Fund, projected to remain below 5 percent of exports, as a result of the proposed purchases (Tables 8 and 9).

Monitoring of the Droe;ram Close monitoring of program implementation will be essential for its success, including to enable the authorities to respond quickly to unanticipated developments (paragraphs 33 and 35 of the attached letter of intent, as well as annex). In addition to prior actions (Table lo), performance criteria, indicative targets, structural benchmarks, and reviews, the authorities will establish a monitoring committee, who will meet monthly, with the Fund resident representative and Fund-supported general advisor to the NBB as observers. In this context, the staff welcomes the authorities' appreciation of the importance of reliable trade statistics, and their intention to take necessary measures to improve their quality, including the implementation of recent technical assistance recommendations. In the fiscal area, expenditure data should improve with the further development of the Treasury, and national accounts data are being improved with the assistance of the Fund. IV. Staff ADDraisal: Challenges Ahead From its beginning in mid-1994, the Government of newly elected President Lukashenko saw the restoration of financial discipline as a pre- condition for economic stabilization, and price policy actions were taken to sharply reduce the burden of subsidies on the budget. A strengthening of fiscal revenue collections in late 1994 also allowed a significant turnaround in the deficit of the general government. Progress with reducing inflation remained, however, elusive because there was no political will to sharply limit the extension of directed credit by the NBB to ailing sectors of the economy. The staff welcomes the evident break from the past that has occurred in this respect since the new year, as evidenced by the rapid decline in inflation during the second quarter of this year. It commends the authorities for their determination to further reduce inflation. Despite the risks from administrative price increases and the impact of any exchange rate depreciation, the disinflation targets for the remainder of the year are, in the staff's view, appropriately ambitious and achievable. The staff also welcomes the increasing realization by the authorities that price liberalization, particularly in agriculture, is not only the key element of the transition to the market, but also fundamentally underpins the success of stabilization policies. It has good reason to believe that the authorities' commitment to these principles is now irreversible. The authorities had also built a track record of progress with introducing market mechanisms (particularly in the external area) before the present program--and further significant measures in that direction will be implemented with the program. But such a track record remains essentially to be established in other systemic areas, in particular privatization and establishment of a regulatory environment truly conducive to private sector development. Under the program, the authorities are committed to take a number of significant, albeit still modest, steps in these areas. The staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - believes that these steps are realistic and achievable, and that they will, when implemented, enhance the credibility of the Belarussian authorities' commitment to market reforms. Full and sustained implementation of the program will require: (i) in the monetary area, that the authorities continue to resist the pressure from enterprise lobbies, particularly in agriculture and agro- processing, for more credit and subsidies, and are ready to respond quickly to possible unexpected developments, in particular on the foreign exchange market. Close monitoring of the financial position of banks will be necessary as the process of disinflation is likely to further weaken their portfolio; (ii) in the fiscal area, that the authorities are prepared to protect overall budgetary objectives from any further deterioration in the tax revenue situation, about which there is currently an unusual degree of uncertainty because of the difficulty of assessing the impact of macroeconomic stabilization on tax bases and compliance, and adhere to the restrictive wage policy envisaged. Achievement of fiscal objectives will also require that the enterprises service their external obligations, and in particular promptly recover domestic payments for energy deliveries with a view to meeting, without further intervention by the Government, the planned settlement of external payments arrears for energy imports from Russia accumulated in early 1995; and (iii) in the structural area, that the Government's commitment to implement the program's systemic reforms, in particular privatization and increases in tariffs for household services and utilities, is not deflected by those who have a vested interest in the status quo. In the view of the staff, the authorities will have under the program the necessary tools to meet these challenges. In the monetary area, the changes envisaged in the agricultural procurement system should reduce the role of Government, and structural reforms of the monetary system should strengthen short term instruments for sterilization or tightening monetary policy. The structural reforms in the fiscal area should also further strengthen the rather effective tax administration Belarus has so far maintained, and the authorities already demonstrated ability to implement a strict cash rationing and prioritization of expenditures when necessary, although greater caution in funding certain expenditure appropriations is needed to improve cash management and minimize the likelihood of delays in payments for other expenditures. Finally, in the structural area, the risks should be minimized by policies making the playing field as level as possible, and by the formulation and implementation of a targeted and fiscally sustainable social safety net for those most affected by the economic reforms. Ultimately, however, the success of the program will depend on the political will to implement it fully in spirit as well as in letter. With the early implementation of a significant list of policy measures, the authorities have made a commendable start. This should be reinforced by a sustained public commitment by the highest levels of Government to the program and the process of both stabilization and broad market reforms it Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - represents. This is vital to maximize the credibility of the program and its chances of success, including in laying the foundations for a resumption in economic growth. The staff believes that, with such a sustained commitment, the authorities' program should consolidate the recent success in reducing inflation, and significantly increase the market-orientation of the Belarussian economy. V. Fund Related Issues It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation with Belarus be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Since the last Article IV Consultation, Belarus has eliminated several exchanee measures maintained under Article XIV, section 2; including (i) previous exchange restrictions arising from limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for bona fide payments for invisibles, including tourist travel; and (ii) the multiple currency practice arising from the spread between the official rate and the rates which are freely negotiated in the foreign exchange market outside of the hard currency auctions. lJ However, Belarus continues to maintain the following exchange measures under Article XIV, Section 2: (i) restrictions arising from the approval requirement for payments for certain categories of imports; and (ii) a multiple currency practice arising from the tax on the repatriation of profits by nonresidents. Moreover, the staff identified an exchange restriction which was introduced in 1993 and is therefore subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). Specifically, while most balances maintained under so-called nonresident rubel "N" accounts are freely convertible, Belarus imposes a limitation on the convertibility of interest earned on these accounts, and as a result, a restriction arises. 2J In the absence of a clear timetable for the removal of,this measure, the staff does not recommend approval. I/ The special exchange rates applicable to mail transfers by individuals and for pension payments made by the government of the Russian Federation have also been abolished. 2/ Nonresidents can also maintain balances under rubel "L" accounts which can be credited by other proceeds, and which are convertible.

A. 1995 Consultation 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the Republic of Belarus' exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Section 2(a), and in concluding the 1995 Article XIV consultation with the Republic of Belarus, in the light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with the Republic of Belarus conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. The Republic of Belarus maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, described in EBS/95/128, in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2, except for the exchange restriction arising from limitation on the transferability of certain balances maintained in nonresident rubel accounts which is subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). The Fund encourages the Republic of Belarus to eliminate the measures maintained under Article XXV, Section 2 as soon as its balance of payments position permits and urges the Republic of Belarus to eliminate the exchange restriction that is subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a).

As you know, the IMF Executive Board at the end of January approved a second purchase under the STF for Belarus in support of an economic and structural adjustment program for 1995, described in our Memorandum of Economic Policies of December 4, 1994 and supplementary letter of intent dated January 26, 1995. The IMF Board could not consider at that time our request for a stand-by arrangement because the financing assurances to cover the balance of payments gap were not yet in place. Substantial progress was made in this direction in March, with the conditional approval of an ECU 75 million loan from the EU, among other new commitments. 2. In the meantime, we have been implementing the policies we committed ourselves to, although progress has been slower than envisaged, particularly in the area of systemic market reforms. Specifically, the government has followed a strict fiscal policy and the National Bank of Belarus (NBB) has adhered to a tight credit policy which enabled us to keep the expansion in net domestic assets (NDA) of the NBB, the deficit of the general government, and its financing through the banking system within the ceilings set for end-March 1995 under the second STF program. 3. Initially, the positive impact of these policies in reducing inflation were partially offset by substantial increases in base money and NDA of the banking system as we failed to sterilize the monetary impact of unexpectedly large sales of foreign exchange to the banking system. Other negative factors were a greater than anticipated impact of price liberalization, as well as larger than programmed wage increases. Inflation remained therefore much higher than targeted in the first few months of 1995, but has decelerated rapidly since March, reaching 2.5 percent in June. A key factor in this process has been the success so far of financial policies in stabilizing the exchange rate. 4. Some of the structural reforms envisaged under the economic program supported by the second purchase under the STF have been implemented, including increases in tariffs for household services and utilities, and greater reliance on market mechanisms for the allocation of NBB refinancing. However, several key structural benchmarks in the area of privatization and enterprise reform, in particular, could not be met. We also recognize that certain decisions taken in recent months in the direction of more government control on the economy, such as stricter rules for the repatriation of foreign exchange proceeds and the introduction of minimum prices for exports, as well as the suspension of licenses of investment funds and the invalidation of an auction of enterprises may have created the impression that Belarus's commitment to market mechanisms and reforms is weak. We assure you that this is not the case. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 33 - ATTACHMENT I 5. Despite the better than anticipated overall balance of payments developments so far in 1995, Belarus's external position remains extremely precarious. We are concerned that the substantial real appreciation of the real exchange rate of the Belarussian rubel since early 1995 is endangering the competitiveness of our exports and profitability. Furthermore, the contraction in economic activity has continued, and the situation with domestic and external payments arrears worsened. The Belarussian government is conscious that acceleration of the stabilization process and of market reforms is an essential condition for halting the decline in living standards and setting the stage for a resumption of economic growth. The necessary improvement in the quality and variety of goods produced in Belarus as well as in productivity will not come about unless government interventions are further reduced, and an environment conducive to private domestic and foreign investment created. 6. Therefore, we remain fully committed to the reform objectives stated in our Memorandum of Economic Policies for 1995, and have formulated an economic program for the remainder of this year and the first half of 1996 aimed at making considerable progress toward reaching price stability and implementation of a market economy. To assist us in implementing the adjustment and financial program described in this letter, we request from the IMF a twelve-month stand-by arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 196.28 million (70 percent of quota). 7. Under the program, macroeconomic oolicies will continue to aim at progressively reducing monthly inflation to at most 1 percent by the end of 1995, and a further decline in 1996. With a view to supporting the dis- inflationary process and maintaining profitability, we intend to adhere to the limits set for the path of average wages in the budget sector (including bonuses) as detailed in Table 1 of the Annex. We do not intend to raise the current minimum wage at this stage, but will consult with the Fund staff prior to any decision to adjust the minimum wage in the future. We will take steps to ensure that state enterprises which depend on government support in one form or another (including tax exemptions and arrears) do not grant wage increases greater in nominal terms than those granted in the budget sphere. 8. We agree that further progress with genuine price liberalization is required, particularly with regard to certain food prices. In this context, a resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers forbidding local authorities to directly or indirectly interfere, including through the establishment of ceilings on profit, with the principle of free prices for these products has been publicly issued June 28, 1995. The decree also abolished all previous resolutions contrary to this principle, including Decree 249. The register of so-called monopolistic enterprises subject to price regulations was abolished on June 15, with only the prices of natural monopolies continuing to be regulated. 9.

We intend therefore to adhere to the objective of reaching cost recovery of 60 percent from July 1, 1995 and 80 percent from January 1, 1996 (these ratios are average of cost recovery ratios based on summer and winter costs and tariffs). Specifically, tariffs for rents were increased by 3 times and those for heating, hot water, and liquified gas, among others, by 1.5 to 2.0 times on July 4, 1995, bringing cost coverage to 60 percent. In the context of the 1996 budget, we will review the appropriateness of the norm establishing at 15 percent the ceiling a family may pay for household services, and will propose amendments to the law as may be necessary. Tariffs will be reviewed every month and have been indexed for inflation. Procedures to ensure prompt payments of utility bills, including when possible cut-off of supply, have been strengthened, including for electricity. To assist the neediest segments of the population to cope with the tariff increases, particularly in the winter, we will introduce a targeted compensation scheme further outlined below. In addition, cross-subsidization of households by industry for electricity, gas, and heating will be progressively reduced and eliminated in the context of the 1996 budget before April 15, 1996. 10. For the remainder of 1995 and in the 1996 budget we will continue the tight fiscal nolicv pursued so far with considerable success. Considerable pressures on the budget have, however, appeared in the second quarter of 1995 related in particular to mounting tax arrears, unbudgeted net lending to agriculture, a rising imbalance in the Social Protection Fund, and also inadequate cash management procedures. The necessary reduction and restructuring of expenditures have been addressed in a revised 1995 state budget which was adopted by Presidential decree on July 12, 1995. Taking into account the lower expectations of foreign financing, the revised budget aims at containing the overall deficit of the general government to at most 3.2 percent of GDP in 1995, and its domestic bank financing to at most 2.4 percent of GDP (excluding EU financing expected to be disbursed through the NBB, in an amount equivalent to about 0.4 percent of GDP, but including any use of counterparts to Fund purchases by the government, which, however, is not foreseen under the program). We also intend to introduce a 1996 budget consistent with further reducing that deficit to at most 2 percent of GDP, and to increasingly rely on the floatation of government securities for its domestic financing. Measured from July 1, 1995, the cash general government deficit will not exceed Rbl 1,802 billion as of end-September 1995, and Rbl 3,852 billion as of end-December measured cumulatively from January 1, 1995. These targets will constitute performance criteria under the program (Table 2 of the Annex). 11. Measures have been taken to ensure attainment of the deficit target for this year, while preserving key government services without recourse to spending arrears. On the revenue side, we intend to improve revenue collections by strengthening tax administration, by broadening the individual income tax and Chernobyl tax base, as well as by not granting any discretionary tax exemptions for VAT and excises beyond the small amounts granted so far. The adoption of the customs tariffs of the Russian Federation under the agreed customs union is, furthermore, expected to be revenue enhancing as Belarus adopted Russia's higher import tariff schedule. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 35 - ATTACHMENT I On the expenditure side, we intend to contain subsidies and net lending, on the one hand, and the government wage bill, on the other hand, to no more than 5 percent and 6 percent of GDP, respectively, and to strictly limit other discretionary expenditures. These policies would be consistent with a reduction in total outlays of the state budget to 36 percent of GDP in 1995, or 4 percentage points lower than in 1994. To protect the stabilization objectives against the risk that fiscal revenues turn out to be weaker than projected, we have identified in the budget an expenditure contingency of some 2 percent of GDP, including interest subsidies, net lending, and capital expenditure; part of these expenditures will only be affected to the extent that revenue does not fall short of projections. Furthermore, certain Chernobyl expenditures expected to be financed through grants from Russia will only be implemented to the extent that these disbursements are forthcoming, 12. Within the above budget target, we intend to allocate about Rbl 500 billion in the second half of 1995 to the financing of a social safety net scheme to partially compensate, particularly in the winter, the most vulnerable groups of the population for the impact of increases in tariffs for household services and utilities. Under the scheme, which is being developed with the assistance of the World Bank and the Fund, targeting will be mainly categorical- -covering needy non-working pensioners, the unemployed, and families with many children. Provisions for continuation of this scheme will also be made in the 1996 budget. The implementation of the compensation scheme will be reviewed ahead of the winter season. 13. Recently, the financial position of the Social Protection Fund has come under pressure due to changes in the legislation that caused growth of pensions as well as due to delays in making social security contributions. We intend, however, to contain the expenditure of this fund within available resources by (i) reducing pensions to working pensioners; (ii) phasing out the'Rb1 50,000 pension supplement introduced in January 1995; and (iii) cutting other expenditures, mainly on health, supported by the Pension Fund. At the same time, greater pressure will be exerted on enterprises to meet their payroll tax obligations, including by giving higher priority to payments of social security contributions. Collection rates are also expected to strengthen in comparison with the recent past as a result of the decline in wage inflation, given the collection lag. The need for further reforming the pension system to make it financially viable in the medium term will be reviewed in the context of preparations of the 1996 budget, with the support of technical assistance from the World Bank and the Fund. 14. The 1996 budget will aim at further reducing the size of government expenditures, including additional cuts in subsidies and net lending. The tax system will be made more market-oriented, including by (i) narrowing the range of profit and income tax rates on enterprises around the standard rate of 30 percent; and (ii) reforming the VAT system to reduce its distortionary elements and increase its efficiency. In particular, we are considering changing the basis for levying the VAT from the subtraction method to the invoice or credit method, and moving to exempt capital goods purchases from VAT while at the same time abolish the exemption allowing the deduction of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - ATTACHMENT I investment expenditure from the profit tax basis. To assist us with these reforms, we are requesting early Fund technical assistance. In addition, steps will be taken to relaunch efforts to modernize tax administration, and we are committed to have the recently established Treasury integrate all spending accounts of ministries into the Treasury account by January 1996. We are also committed not to introduce any new extrabudgetary fund in the program period, and to consolidate or eliminate with the 1996 budget several of existing extrabudgetary funds. In particular, the Agricultural Support Fund will be eliminated, and centralized investment funds will be gradually phased out. Tax and expenditure policies under the 1996 budget will be further specified in the context of the first program review. 15. Further steps have been taken in recent weeks to accelerate the liberalization of external transactions, including (i) the elimination of all remaining surrender requirements; (ii) authorizing banks to trade both the U.S. dollar and the Russian ruble on the interbank market; and (iii) abolishing the lists of minimum and maximum export and import prices. While repatriation requirements have been tightened with the implementation of Presidential Decree 52, trade "passports" serve only as instrument to collect statistics and discourage tax evasion and not as a form of pre- authorization for exports/imports. 16. During the program period, we intend to pursue a more flexible exchange rate policy, which is to be managed with due regard to both maintaining the competitiveness of Belarussian goods abroad and achieving the program's targets for strengthening the NBB's international reserve position. 17. Starting in September 1994, Belarus had good success in preventing the further accumulation of new external payments arrears, although the situation has become more difficult in the past few months. We eliminated in late June some recent late payments on government external debt obligations, but outstanding external payments arrears for gas from Russia are estimated to have increased by some US$55 million since end-December 1994, reaching some US$460 million. During the program period, we are committed not to accumulate new arrears, and to reduce outstanding gas arrears to no more than US$435 million by end-September 1995, and to no more than US$419 million by end-December 1995, or the amount outstanding on August 1, 1994. This will constitute a performance criterion under the program. Negotiations with Russia on the regularization of gas arrears outstanding as of August 1, 1994 are continuing in the framework of a bilateral committee, and it is not expected that any understandings reached on this issue would have balance of payments implications for the program period. 18. The first stage of the creation of a customs union with the Russian Federation has been completed. In particular, non-tariff and tariff restrictions on trade between the two countries have been eliminated, customs borders with the Russian Federation have been abolished, and the customs systems of the two countries have been unified. Within the limits imposed by these customs union arrangements, we aim at furthering the progress made in the past two years in the direction of freer trade and a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - ATTACHMENT I more uniform and low import duty system. To this effect, we intend to negotiate with the Russian Federation, during the second stage of implementation of the customs union, exceptions to the common export and import duty systems, with a view to limiting taxation of exports produced in Belarus and of imports not competing with goods produced in Belarus. 19. In the remainder of 1995, the NBB will continue to pursue a tight monetary nolicv, as required, to bring inflation to at most 1 percent a month by the end of the year, and to reach a level of gross international reserves equivalent to some 1.5 months of imports. Specifically, we will aim at maintaining positive real interest rates based on the past inflation rate and prospects for the immediate future, taking into account developments in market interest rates and on the foreign exchange market. In line with this objective, the NBB refinance rate, the minimum interest rate on time deposits, and the minimum interest rate on demand deposits (of households) were set at 8, 10, and 3 percent, on a monthly basis, respectively, on June 22, 1995. We intend to reduce the minimum interest rate on time deposits to 7 percent by July 20, 1995 while keeping the other rates unchanged. The maximum interest rate margin of banks was raised from 3 to 5 percentage points in late June. Furthermore, all new credits and rolled-over credits of the NBB are now extended at the basic refinance rate except for NBB credit to finance the government deficit. For the remainder of the program period, we agree to consult with the staff of the IMF prior to any adjustment in interest rates set by the NBB. 20. Expansion in base money will be contained to no more than Rbl 950 billion and Rbl 1,352 billion between end-June and end-September, and end- June and end-December 1995, respectively. Furthermore, the growth in net domestic assets (NDA) of the NBB will be limited to no more than Rbl 1,032 billion and Rbl 2,323 billion between end-June and end-September and end- June and end-December 1995, respectively. This is consistent with achieving changes in net international reserves of minus US$42 million and minus US$112 million between end-June and end-September, and end-June and end- December 1995, respectively. In setting the above targets, taking into account our intentions regarding mandatory reserve requirements for banks (see paragraph 21 below), we aim at limiting the growth in NDA of the banking system to no more than Rbl 2,558 billion and Rbl 5,306 billion, respectively, in these periods. Consistent with the fiscal objectives, within these limits, net borrowing of the general government from the banking system will be limited to Rbl 1,850 billion and Rbl 3,138 billion in the same periods. The above targets have been based on a cautious assessment of trends in the decline of velocity. The targets for the periods June-September and June-December constitute performance criteria (targets for NDA of the NBB will be indicative), as detailed in Table 2 of the Annex. 21. The NBB has raised mandatory bank reserve requirements several times since early March 1995. On June 1, they were increased to 8 percent and 12 percent for foreign exchange and rubel deposits, respectively; and on July 1 the mandatory reserve requirement for foreign exchange deposits was raised to 10 percent. The NBB intends to unify it with that for rubel Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 .- ATTACHMENT I deposits, at 12 percent, on August 1, 1995. Furthermore, the NBB has begun to issue, on market terms, its own securities--Rbl 43 billion were sold at the first auction on June 6-- and intends to conduct further auctions as necessary. The fairly high market interest rate of 18 percent reached at that first auction suggests that we are right in being cautious with lowering NBB interest rates. Finall:y, with a view both to containing the expansion of NBB claims on domestic banks (a key component of NDA of the NBB) and to strengthening monetary management, the NBB will progressively phase out lending in foreign exchange to domestic banks. 22. Under the program, we will continue to make progress toward using competitive market mechanisms as a basis for credit allocation. Hence, the NBB aims at extending at least 60 percent of its gross refinancing to banks (including lending of any counterparts to Fund purchases to nongovernment) through credit auctions in the third quarter of 1995, and at having at least 80 percent of its refinancing extended through such means from the last quarter of the year (the remainder being extended as general NBB refinance at the basic NBB refinance rate, mainly for investment and agriculture). For the purpose of monitoring this benchmark, gross refinancing of various forms will be weighted according to maturity. 23. A part of the summer harvest was pre-financed by credit extended by the budget (on subsidized terms and for state deliveries) and by banks to procurement organizations which advanced cash to farms against future deliveries. The remaining procurement financing needs in the third quarter of the year will be met exclusively on market terms by banks, within the program's NDA target, by private capital, and by recycling of budget lending for the planting season as it is being repaid. Centralized purchases by the state are projected to decline sharply. For the 1996 spring planting, the government is committed to phase out the system of subsidized pre-financing through the budget, and to move further in the direction of greater decentralization and reliance on market mechanisms. We will review the progress toward effective functioning of more decentralized means to finance agriculture, including through the use of the enterprises' own working capital, at the time of the second review of the Fund program. 24. The NBB has taken steps to strengthen bank supervision regulations regarding capital adequacy, solvency, limits on lending to shareholders and large exposures, and provisioning against nonperforming loans. The recent rise of the minimum chartered capital of banks to ECU 1 million, which will be further raised to ECU 2 million, has encouraged a process of bank consolidation. In this context, the NBB has also organized the liquidation of two small insolvent banks. We aim to make further progress during the program in strengthening bank supervision regulations, for which we expect to receive assistance from a resident bank supervision expert provided under Fund technical assistance beginning July 1995. 25. We recognize that the ability of the Belarussian banking system to undertake prudent lending remains limited, and that the financial position of certain banks is weak. In the framework of our collaboration with the IBRD and the EBRD on the Private Sector Development Loan, we will create Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - ATTACHMENT I before end-July a working group to analyze the situation and develop solutions to these problems. Progress with the diagnostic work and formulation of a strategy to restructure/liquidate problem banks will also be assessed at the time of the second review under the Fund-supported program. By then we aim to have a specific action plan for the remainder of 1996, and will involve both the Fund-supported general advisor at the NBB and the Fund Resident Representative in the preparatory work. 26. Implementation of systemic market reforms so far in 1995 has fallen far short of targets set in our initial Memorandum of Economic Policies and supplementary letter of intent for 1995. We continue to believe, however, that the development of a market environment based on private ownership and entrepreneurship is an essential prerequisite for the resumption of growth in a stable macroeconomic environment. Therefore, we intend to accelerate that process in the remainder of 1995 and in 1996, and progress will be monitored through structural benchmarks (Table 3 of the Annex). 27. We plan to further reduce during the program period the requiring of licenses for business activities to cases when strictly justified on the grounds of public health and safety protection. To begin with, the Ministry of Economy, in cooperation with the Ministries of Industry and Trade, will survey all existing licensing requirements before end-July 1995 with a view to abolishing immediately those not meeting the above criteria; implementation will be assessed at the time of the first program review. Registration for new businesses has been greatly simplified during the past two years, and we do not intend to introduce during the program period any new impediments to that process. 28. We aim at progressing with privatization during the program period. To reach this objective, several steps are being taken: first, the 1995 privatization program for republican enterprises was approved by the President on July 22, 1995. In addition, local governments have approved their municipal privatization programs for 1995; second, the issuance of privatization vouchers is being accelerated; third, the problems with investment are being resolved and a Presidential instruction re-instating at least 34 out of 38 investment funds will be issued before August [16], 1995. At the same time a new auction of some 40 enterprises was announced. We intend to conduct other auctions of enterprises monthly. 29. The number of republican and municipal enterprises which have been "privatized" including through corporatization, stood at 1,259 at end-March 1995, representing some 12 percent of all enterprises or 9 percent of state capital. Of these, 685 had effectively been privatized (i.e. at least 51 percent of the capital of the enterprises was in private hands). Under the approved privatization program, we target increasing the number of transformed and effectively privatized enterprises to at least 2,230 and 1,250 by end-December 1995. The process of privatization will continue in 1996 and targets for that year will be set at the time of the second review. 30. Privatization will also be facilitated by the passage of a new law on private ownership of land extending property rights of industrial land to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - ATTACHMENT I legal entities and foreign investors. The draft law has been agreed by the President and will be submitted to the Supreme Soviet at its first session. Until the law is adopted by the Supreme Soviet, those rights are being guaranteed and cases of such land privatization have already taken place. 31. Restructuring of agriculture and agro-industries is one of the most difficult problems confronting the government, and we recognize that limited progress has been achieved so far. Implementation of Decree 51 relating to the transformation and privatization of farms and agro-industries is being accelerated: agricultural purchase prices are now free; and no less than 100 agro-processing enterprises were corporatized by July [l], 1995. We intend to submit at the first session of the Supreme Soviet legislation granting individual members of state and collective farms transferrable rights to the land they share, as a critical step toward privatization and restructuring of state and collective farms. In the meantime, legislation extending the same property rights to state farms as those of collective farms has been passed by the Supreme Soviet in April 1995. Further progress with the formulation and implementation of a strategy for agricultural reform will be assessed at the time of the first program review. 32. Workable bankruptcy legislation and regulations constitute an important element of our efforts to increase the financial discipline of enterprises. A new bankruptcy law defining specific bankruptcy mechanisms has been prepared and agreed by the President and will be submitted to the Supreme Soviet at its first session. We have identified some 30 insolvent enterprises already pending their reorganization or liquidation in the program period, these enterprises will be denied access to bank credit and government assistance to them will be strictly limited and conditional. Progress in these directions will be assessed at the time of the first program review. We are also taking steps to address the problem of interenterprise arrears: first, the changes in bankruptcy legislation and regulation should increase the credibility of the bankruptcy threat on debtors; second, the Cabinet of Ministers will issue a resolution prohibiting management of state enterprises from delivering. goods to enterprises that have substantial arrears to them. Sanctions will be taken against managers of enterprises who continue to deliver goods to such enterprises despite this instruction; third, implementation of regulations on banks prohibiting them from including overdue receivables of enterprises as assets for assessing credit risks will be strengthened. Steps to resolve the outstanding stock of interenterprise arrears, including netting out, securitization of claims, and auction sales of unsold inventories to settle debts will not involve credit extension or government guarantees. 33. Monitoring of nroeram imulementation will be facilitated by monthly meetings of a program implementation committee, which has already been selected and is headed by one of the Deputy 'Prime Ministers. These meetings, to be held shortly after monetary and price data for the previous month become available will be attended by the Fund resident representative and by the Fund-sponsored general advisor to the NBB, as observers. In this context, we recognize that the timely compiling and provision of reliable statistics on real sector, monetary, fiscal, and balance of payments Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 41 - ATTACHMENT I developments on a regular basis is vital to program monitoring. Considerable progress has been made in this area, including with technical assistance provided by the Fund. Remaining weaknesses are mainly with trade statistics, where there continues to be substantial variations across different data sources. We are working on ways to reconcile these differences, and aim at making various trade data sources consistent by end- September 1995. Recent decisions by the Cabinet of Ministers have brought together the agencies involved, with a view to compiling one set of trade data based on detailed customs and Ministry of Statistics' figures. 34. We believe that implementation of the stabilization and structural adjustment program described above will achieve substantial,progress toward price stability and a viable external position, while at the same time creating a critical mass of market reforms on the basis of which productive activities will be able to develop. Despite the compression of imports which will accompany macroeconomic stabilization, the financing gap for the program period is projected at some US$562 million, of which we estimate US$315 million will be covered by disbursements from pledges made by other bilateral and multilateral creditors. We intend to limit nonconcessional external borrowing (as described in the attached annex) during the program period to no more than US$60 million and US$270 million between end-June and end-September and end-June and end-December 1995, respectively, with zero borrowing in the maturity of less than one year and a sub-ceiling of US$25 million and US$50 million, respectively, for the above dates for borrowing with maturities between l-5 years. 35. The Government and the National Bank of Belarus will provide the Fund with any information that it may request for the purpose of monitoring progress under the program supported by the stand-by arrangement, and will remain in close consultations with the Fund in accordance with the Fund's policies on such consultations. We stand ready to take any additional measures that may become necessary to achieve the aims of the program. Furthermore, we will collaborate with the Fund during three scheduled reviews of the program, satisfactory completion of which will also condition the second, third, and fourth purchase under the program. We propose that these reviews, to be completed by November 14, 1995, February 14, 1996, and May 14, 1996, respectively, assess, general economic and policy developments and compliance with quantitative and structural targets set out in this letter. In addition, the first review will focus, in particular, on (i) the formulation of a 1996 budget consistent with the program; (ii) preparation of a monetary program for 1996; (iii) implementation of the targeted compensation scheme for the increase in tariffs for household services and utilities; (iv) progress with measures to prevent the emergence of new domestic and external payments arrears and to settle the stock of outstanding arrears; and (v) progress with formulation and implementation of a strategy for agricultural reform. The second review will focus, in particular, on (i) progress with efforts to strengthen bank supervision and with plans for restructuring the banking system; (ii) experience with operating a liberalized interbank foreign exchange market; (iii) results of the 1995 privatization program and progress with formulation/implementation of a state and municipal privatization program for 1996; (iv) results of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - ATTACHMENTI efforts to improve the financial discipline of enterprises and to liquidate insolvent ones; and (v) experience with implementation of a market-based financing of the agricultural sector. The third review will focus, in particular, on an overall assessment of progress in stabilizing the economy and introducing market reforms, and of prospects and requirements for a sustainable resumption of noninflationary economic growth in 1996/97. 36. During the period of the program, we will not impose or intensify any restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, introduce or modify any multiple currency practices, conclude bilateral payments arrangements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund's articles, or impose or intensify import restrictions *for balance of payments reasons. /S/ Mikhail Chigir Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus /S/ Stanislav Bogdankevidh Chairman of the National Bank of Belarus Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 43 - ANNEX Annex to the Letter of Intent of the Government and National Bank of Belarus 1.

The budgetary sector is defined to include communal services, health and education services, culture, science, and public administration.' Nominal average wage and employment data will be provided by Goskomstat. In April 1995, the average nominal wage and the number of employees in the budgetary sector-- as defined here --amounted to Rbl 681,500 and 888,000 persons, respectively. 2. Performance criteria and indicative tarvets Performance criteria and indicative targets under the program are detailed below and summarized in Table 2. a. Monetary and credit ~olicv (1) Performance criteria: The cumulative increase in the monetary base 4/2/ will not exceed Rbl 950 billion as of end-September 1995, and Rbl 1,352 billion as of end-December 1995. I/ Monetary base comprises currency outside the banking system (calculated by the Currency Department of the NBB), vault cash (currently account 031 of commercial banks), banks' mandatory reserves (currently account 815 and the part of account 067 which relates to mandatory reserves on foreign exchange deposits), and excess reserves held with the NBB (currently credit of account 161 and the credit balance of commercial banks' correspondent accounts); and deposits of nonbank nongovernmental entities with the NBB. u Unless stated otherwise, in this Annex all cumulative changes are calculated relative to the outstanding balance at end-June, 1995. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - ANNEX The cumulative increase in net domestic assets lJ of the banking system will not exceed Rbl 2,558 billion as of end-September 1995, and Rbl 5,306 billion as of end-December 1995. The cumulative increase in net bank credit 2J to the general government 3J (net borrowing) will not exceed Rbl 1,850 billion as of end- September 1995, and Rbl 3,138 billion as of end-December 1995. I/ The net domestic assets of the banking system shall be calculated as the difference between broad money and the net foreign assets of the banking system; NDA comprises lending of the banking system to domestic enterprises and the population, net claims of the bank,ing system on the general government as defined below, and other net assets, including net losses from exchange rate changes. Broad money comprises currency in circulation outside the banking system (as calculated by the Currency Department of the NBB), and rubel and foreign exchange deposits of enterprises and the population held with the banking system. Foreign exchange deposits exclude frozen deposits and the foreign exchange deposits of the general government. The latter are classified under net bank credit to the general government. The net foreign assets comprise convertible currencies, excluding frozen assets and liabilities valued in Belarussian rubels at the program accounting exchange rate of Rbl 14,115 to US$l at end-September 1995 and Rbl 15,294 to US$l at end-December 1995; and correspondent accounts with FSU countries (currently accounts 168, 169 and 991), excluding pre-1994 technical credits that have been converted into government debt, valued in Belarussian rubels at the accounting rate of Rbl 3.01 to Rub 1 at end-September 1995 and Rbl 3.20 to Rub 1 at end-December 1995. u Net bank credit to the General Government is defined as credits extended to the General Government by the NBB and the commercial banks plus the draw-down of bank deposits of the General Government in rubels and foreign currency held with the NBB and the commercial banks minus Rbl 32 billion in liabilities of the NBB to the General Government from the conversion of pre-1994 technical credits into interstate debt. It excludes the use of Fund credit which for program purposes is treated as an external liability of the NBB, but includes on-lending to the General Government of the counterpart to the loan of the European Union (EU), estimated at US$33 million in the fourth quarter. The rubel equivalent of the draw-down of foreign exchange deposits and onlending of EU disbursements is calculated at the quarterly average exchange rate of Rbl 13,833 to US$l in the third quarter of 1995 and Rbl 15,086 to US$l in the fourth quarter; and Rbl 2.97 to 1 Rub in the third quarter of 1995 and Rbl 3.18 to 1 Rub in the fourth quarter of 1995. 3J For the purposes of the program General Government includes the state budget (republican and local), the social :Eunds (Social Protection Fund and Employment Fund), all extrabudgetary funds (including the Road Fund, the Agricultural Support Fund, the Housing Maintenance Fund, the Investment Funds, the Research and Development Fund, the Transportation Fund, and the Conversion Fund), and all extrabudgetary operations of the central and local agencies, including quasi-fiscal operations of the National Bank of Belarus, if any.

The share of NBB refinancing of commercial banks through credit auctions or other market-based instruments will be increased to at least 60 percent of gross credits, including roll-overs, in the third quarter of 1995; and 80 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995. Gross financing of various forms will be weighted according to maturity. b. Fiscal policy performance criteria The cash general government deficit u will be limited to Rbl 1,802 billion for the period January l-September 30, 1995 and to Rbl 3,852 billion for 1995 as a whole. C. Performance criteria on international reserves The cumulative decrease in net international reserves u of the NBB will be limited to not more than US$42 million as of end-September 1995, and US$112 million as of end-December 1995. IJ The net domestic assets (NDA) of the NBB are calculated as the difference between the monetary base, as defined above, and the net foreign assets of the NBB. The net foreign assets of the NBB equal claims minus liabilities to FSU and other countries, either in convertible or non- convertible currencies, and evaluated at the program exchange rate. Thus defined, the NDA comprises lending to banks (currently accounts 622, 813, 821 and 822 plus overdrafts of commercial banks measured by the debit of account 161 and the debit balance of commercial banks' correspondent accounts), general government, enterprises, and other net assets, including losses from valuation differences. 2/ The General Government deficit is the difference between the consolidated revenues and the consolidated expenditures of the General Government. Revenues include tax revenue, social security contributions and other contributions to extrabudgetary funds, non-tax revenue, and grants; it does not include proceeds from privatization. Expenditures include all domestic and foreign General Government expenditures, net lending to enterprises, and interest payments; it does not include amortization of domestic and external debt. u Net international reserves of the NBB are defined as gross international reserves of the NBB (excluding claims in FSU and other non- convertible currencies) minus short-term foreign liabilities of the NBB (including Fund credit and the European Union credit, but excluding liabilities in FSU and other non-convertible currencies). Liabilities to the Fund are calculated from IMF records and are converted into rubels at the program accounting exchange rate.

Performance criteria on accumulation of external arrears During the program period the government will maintain current external debt service and will remain current on gas payments for gas deliveries from Russia. It will also reduce the stock of outstanding arrears on gas payments to no more than US$435 million as of end-September 1995 and no more than PISS419 million as of end-December 1995. e. Performance criteria on the contracting of external debt External borrowing with maturities of l-12 years contracted or guaranteed on non-concessional terms by the Government or the National Bank of Belarus or other agencies on behalf of the Government (excluding proceeds of purchases from the IMF) will not increase cumulatively by more than US$60 million as, of end-September 1995, and US$270 million as of end-December 1995. Within thlese ceilings, the cumulative increase of external debt contracted or guaranteed by these entities, with maturities of l-5 years shall not exceed US$25 million as of end-September 1995, and US$50 million as of end-December 1995. During the period of the program, neither the Government nor the NBB shall contract or guarantee external debt of maturities of up to one year, except for normal trade credits. f. Indicative target on oricing Tariffs for household services--including housing, electricity, natural gas, heating, and public transportation--will be adjusted to maintain cost coverage of at least 60 percent during the third and fourth quarters of 1995 and will be raised to reach cost coverage of at least 80 percent by end- December 1995.

In recent months, we have achieved some success in increasing confidence in our national currency and in sharply reducing inflation, reflecting our pursuit of tighter financial policies. Market mechanisms have also been created to allocate more efficiently goods, foreign exchange, and capital. Economic activity, however, has continued to decline and payments arrears have risen, mainly because our enterprises have found it extremely hard to adjust to the new economic environment. We believe that maintaining the momentum toward price stability is a necessary condition for the eventual resumption of economic growth. This requires greater financial discipline from our enterprises, and continued control on money emission, including for financing of the budget. Further progress toward liberalizing the economy is also essential. This must include freeing prices and reducing subsidies, opening the economy to greater domestic and foreign competition, as well as encouraging state enterprises to privatize and restructure and new private businesses to develop without unnecessary interferences from the state. The ambitious program of economic stabilization and structural market reforms for 1995/96 which I instructed my Government to negotiate with representatives from the International Monetary Fund, and upon which agreement has now been reached, meets these objectives and has received my strong support. We are committed to its full implementation. I know that you fully appreciate the dire economic circumstances my people are confronted with, and our need for generous financial assistance from the international financial community. Without this assistance, the policies we are proposing could not be implemented successfully. I thus hope that the International Monetary Fund will approve soon our request for a stand-by arrangement in support of this program. Yours sincerely, Alexander Lukashenko President of the Republic of Belarus Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - ATTACHMENT III The Republic of Belarus: Stand-Bv Arrangement Attached hereto is a letter (the "Letter"), dated August 1, 1995, from the Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus and the Chairman of the National Bank of Belarus requesting a stand-by arrangement and setting forth: a.

The authorities are fully cooperative in providing data to the Fund promptly, mainly through the Resident Representative's office. The Ministry of Statistics publishes a large amount of data and has a predetermined publication schedule. 1. National accounts The Ministry of Statistics and Analysis, with technical assistance from OECD and the IMF, has switched to the United Nations System of national Accounts (SNA) for compiling GDP and has stopped calculating NMP. GDP is currently calculated monthly, based on production data only, and published with a one month lag. Work is at an advanced stage for preparing a full set of quarterly national accounts and compiling them on a regular basis. A full set of annual national accounts has been prepared for 1990-1993 and final figures for 1994 are expected to be ready by October 1995. The 1994 GDP figures are likely to be underestimated by the under- reporting of the newly emerging sectors, and in particular, services. In addition, problems remain in calculating (i) holding gains from inventories, because of inadequate accounting practices by enterprises, and (ii) the contribution of the external sector in external demand reflecting the lack of comprehensive statistics on external trade flows and prices. 2. Prices Data on Consumer Price Indices (both weekly and monthly CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI)) are being reported to the Fund on a timely basis, v Both indices were developed with substantial technical assistance of the Fund. As regards the PPI, in January 1995 a Laspeyres formula recommended by the Fund was adopted and monthly data for 1994 were recalculated in accordance with this formula. Other recommendations, such as inclusion of exports, adequate specification of items, and better selection of representative products and prices, are in the process of being adopted. Given the changes in relative prices which Belarus has been experiencing, the quality of price statistics could be improved by updating the weights on more timely basis. u The calculation of the monthly CPI is based on the monthly survey of 293 goods and services; and the weekly CPI is based on 117 goods and services, a subset of those included in the monthly survey.

Government finance statistics Monthly government finance data on revenue and expenditure are provided for the state budget, the social funds (Social Protection Fund, Employment Fund), the Road Fund, and the Republican Fund for the Support of Agriculture. However, data coverage of extrabudgetary funds at the Republican and the local level is incomplete and net expenditure of these funds have to be inferred from bank account data. Classification of revenue is generally compatible with the guidelines recommended by the Fund's government finance statistics (GFS) handbook. The present classification of expenditure data, by contrast, remains rooted in the FSU expenditure classification approach, which does not distinguish satisfactorily between capital and current transactions and does not allow the derivation of an economic classification of expenditure along GFS guidelines. Progress in moving to an analytically meaningful expenditure classification is to be expected as the Treasury expands its coverage of spending organizations. Monthly revenue and expenditure data are usually provided with a lag of only three to six weeks. The Ministry of Finance compiles monthly data on tax arrears. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance lacks adequate records on expenditure arrears, in particular at the local government level. The further implementation of the Treasury project holds out the promise of significant improvements in preparing regular and timely reports on spending commitments and deliveries. Detailed information on domestic bank financing of general government institutions is compiled by the National Bank of Belarus. At the same time, the authorities' reporting system for data covering foreign financing of general government institutions as well as government debt and guarantees is fragmented and incomplete. This has led to considerable difficulties in assessing and monitoring the availability of foreign financing as well as reconciling spending and revenue records with financing data. The development of centralized registers to record details of domestic and foreign debt as well as contingent liabilities should be a priority. More generally, the establishment of a small GFS data compilation unit within the Ministry of Finance may be essential for decisively improving the analytical content of government finance statistics. In 1994, Belarus reported updated 1993 government finance data to STA. However, the data were not published because of missing entries and inconsistencies that need to be resolved. 4. Monetarv statistics Monthly data are provided on the balance sheet of the National Bank (NBB) and the monetary survey usually with a lag of no more than two to three weeks. With help from STA, the NBB has set up a compilation unit and has made significant progress in improving the quality of monetary statistics. The figures on most monetary aggregates and bank credit are reliable. The estimate of net foreign assets has still problems stemming Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 59 - from improper sectorization of accounts but the NBB, under guidance by the Fund, is continuously improving the estimates. Crucial for the improvement of monetary statistics is the new chart of accounts, both for the NBB and commercial banks, that is being drafted by the NBB and scheduled to be introduced by 1996. Interest rate data on bank deposits and credits, as well as data on NBB credit auctions and the placement of NBB and government securities, are provided with a one-month lag. The NBB also reports to the Fund, with a few days lag, information on the exchange rate, its interventions in the market, and its gross foreign exchange reserves at the end of the month. As mentioned above there are difficulties in reconciling budget financing data from the Ministry of Finance with data on net credit to government derived from the banking system. The problem is expected to be alleviated with the expanded operation of the Treasury, expected in 1996. In the case of. discrepancies, the Fund staff relies on banking data. 5. Balance of pavments statistics Foreign trade data are prepared monthly, generally with a one to two month lag. Despite improvements, due in part to frequent IMF technical assistance missions which have provided advice on preparation of trade and balance of payments data, the data remain unreliable. Trade data for 1993 and 1994 are in the process of being revised. Trade data are separated into trade with CIS states and trade with the rest of the world. For trade with CIS states, the only source of data is the Ministry of Statistics. Monthly trade data for CIS states are based on reports to the Ministry of Statistics by state owned enterprises. These data are supplemented quarterly by surveys of joint ventures, foreign-owned firms, and private Belarussian-owned firms. Serious problems have existed with regard to the reporting of data on imports from CIS states, with the National Bank at times reporting significantly different data than those reported by the Ministry of Statistics. There are two main sources of data on trade with the rest of the world- -reports from Customs and the Ministry of Statistics. These two sources differ widely in the reported levels of imports, exports and the trade balance. Each source suffers from problems which make it unreliable. Customs data classify some Russian imports and exports which cross Belarus as Belarussian imports and exports (perhaps due to misclassification, but also due to mis-reporting on the part of the importer, who wished to pay the previously lower Belarussian import duties). On the other hand, the Ministry of Statistics misses a significant share of trade conducted by other than state owned enterprises. Trade data reported by the IMF staff rely on the Ministry of Statistics trade data, adjusted for known or estimated errors and omissions. The authorities are in the process of devising a system to reconcile the discrepancies in the two sources of trade Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 60 - ATTACHMENT IV data, by combining both the Customs and Ministry of Statistics information sources to produce one, consistent set of trade data. It is hoped this effort will yield results by the end of 1995. All trade transactions are recorded in Belarussian rubels at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction. Reported U.S. dollar trade data are generated from these rubel trade data by using a daily weighted average exchange rate, calculated by the National Bank, where the weights are based on sales of foreign exchange. Discrepancies between this weight, and a more appropriate (but not currently calculated) trade weighted average exchange rate introduce errors into the reported trade data. Information on invisibles transactions is limited, unreliable, and subject to substantial revisions. Information on official loan receints is relatively good and is prepared by the authorities based on bank records of disbursements. Information on official transfers is poor. Data on the gross and net official reserve nosition of the Central Bank is provided monthly with a short lag, and more frequently on request. As indicated above, problems of misclassification of assets and liabilities are being addressed. Data on official external debt and debt service oblieations are prepared by the Ministry of Finance. While the data are reasonably good, the lack of computerization of the records has resulted in errors in estimated debt stocks and debt service obligations. The staff is attempting to assist the authorities in reassessing the stock of external debt, while the authorities, with the assistance of the World Bank, are attempting to computerize the debt reporting and monitoring system.

As part of this work, the first Belarus Country Economic Memorandum was prepared in May 1993. The Consultative Group for Belarus was consti- tuted, and a preliminary meeting, chaired by the World Bank, was convened in May 1993, to introduce Belarus to the international community and to mobilize support for a core program of institution-building technical assistance. The World Bank has subsequently prepared a number of studies on economic and sector issues, including the environment, the labor market, the agricultural sector, and the energy sector. A poverty monitoring study, a studay of the financial sector, as well as a transport sector review are presently underway. The World Bank is providing financial assistance to support Belarus' reform program, promote efficiency and restore growth through investment projects, and foster institutional development. In July 1993 the World Bank approved an Institution Building Loan (USS8.3 million) to strengthen economic management for the transition to a private-sector-led market economy, in particular in the areas of public resource mobilization and management, privatization, financial sector reform, social safety, and aid coordination. In November 1993 a Rehabilitation Loan (US$120 million) was approved to support the Government's reform program, support access of importers to foreign exchange, and finance critically needed imports. In May 1994 a Forestry Management Project (USs41.9 million) was approved. A Private Enterprise Development Loan (USS35.7) is in an advanced stage of discussion, and discussions on a Structural Adjustment Loan are expected to be initiated shortly. Several technical assistance and institution building activities were also undertaken in high priority areas. Grants from the Institutional Development Fund have been approved to finance activities in support of the development of the legal and methodological framework for privatization and demonopolization, the strengthening of public procurement legislation, the adoption of new accounting systems in the banking sector, the establishment of a land and real estate cadastre, the strengthening of institutions for legal reform, and power system planning; the total approved amount of these grants is US$l million. A grant of US$l million from the Global Environment Facility was a1s.o approved to finance a forest biodiversity protection project in the Belovezhskaya National Park. A second pre-Consultative Group meeting was covenend in October 1993, to coordinate international efforts to fund the external resource needs of the transition process. Participants expressed support for Belarus' reform efforts, encouraged the Government to accelerate the implementation of its reform program, and indicated that increasing levels of assistance can be expected to flow to Belarus as market reforms take hold. At the request of the Government, the World Bank established a Resident Mission in Minsk in September 1994. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public
