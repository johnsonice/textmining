These distortions have hindered the development of the non-oil sector and the accumulation of human capital, while the social fabric has been stretched by severe income inequalities. During the last two years, Angola has embarked on a process of economic reform, with support from two staff-monitored programs. Within this period, the central bank was externally audited, the trade regime liberalized, the management of customs contracted out to a private company, and a diagnostic study of the oil sector initiated. Nevertheless, the implementation of these and other measures were significantly delayed, quantitative targets persistently missed, and critical issues related to the transparency of public finances not addressed. Despite a windfall of oil revenues and substantially lower defense expenditures in the last two years, progress towards macroeconomic stability has been limited. The fiscal position has improved markedly since 1999, but annual inflation remains at over 100 percent. At the root of inflation has been the insufficient control of public sector spending, including extrabudgetary expenditures and discrepancies in the fiscal accounts of between 10 percent and 40 percent of GDP. Frequent dialogue with the authorities and significant technical assistance in recent years has yielded little progress in the key areas of governance and fiscal transparency. There is virtually no public information on fiscal and external public borrowing, the state-owned oil company manages the country’s oil-related receipts through a web of opaque offshore accounts, the central bank and other public companies suffer from poor internal controls and large operational deficits, and the weakness of basic economic data hampers the design and monitoring of a macroeconomic program. It would be very difficult for Angola to formulate a meaningful poverty reduction strategy without addressing these and other transparency and governance-related problems. Discussions centered on implementing a consistent economic stabilization and reform program based on a prudent monetary policy supported by fiscal consolidation, a flexible foreign exchange rate policy, and appropriate transparency and governance measures. The importance of implementing recommendations from recent technical assistance missions was also discussed, as well as the need to reinforce the units in charge of producing key economic data. The authorities expressed interest in a Fund-supported program. The staff emphasized the need to establish a sound track record of implementation through a staff-monitored program (SMP). Transparency enhancements, initially in the provision of information and data, would be the first step in designing a new SMP. Such a step requires political commitment, much more than it does technical assistance. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- 1. INTRODUCTION 1. The 2002 Article IV consultation- discussions were conducted during missions that visited Luanda on July 17-3 1, 2001, and February 5-14,2002.’ The staff met with the Minister of Finance, Mr. Bessa; the Governor of the central bank, Mr. Jaime; the Minister of Planning, Ms. Lourenco; the Minister of Public Administration, Mr. Pitra Neto; the chairman of Sonangol (the state-owned oil company), Mr. Vicente; and other senior government officials. The mission also met with representatives of the business and banking associations, nongovernmental organizations, members of parliament, and representatives of the diplomatic community. 2. The Executive Board concluded the most recent Article IV consultation with Angola on July 19, 2000 (EBM/OO/lO; 7/19/00). At that time, Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ formulation of a staff-monitored program (SMP) and their intention to begin a much-needed process of economic reform. Directors underscored the importance of improving transparency and social conditions, lowering inflation, and normalizing relations with external creditors. They highlighted the need to expedite privatization and recommended the early sale of the state-owned banks. Directors encouraged the authorities to adjust utility prices periodically and eliminate public sector arrears, and stressed the value of addressing capacity constraints in the civil service and shortcomings in the statistical database. 3. Following unsatisfactory performance under a first SMP during April- December 2000, a second SMP was formulated for the period January-June 2001 .2 The second SMP was deemed necessary to allow Angola to build a track record of implementation before initiating discussions on a Fund-supported program. Performance under the second SMP was also unsatisfactory. There was progress in implementing some of the envisaged measures, such as the preparation of a plan to eliminate public sector arrears, the initiation of a diagnostic study of the oil sector, and the first external audit of the central bank. There were, however, numerous delays in the implementation of these and other measures, persistent deviations from the quantitative targets (including the ceilings on new nonconcessional debt), and little success in improving transparency and the quality of fiscal and external debt data. Progress toward macroeconomic stabilization was also slower than expected. ’ Staff members participating in one or both missions were Mr. Gelbard (head), Mr. Alvesson, Mr. Leite, Ms. Scott, Mr. Walsh, and Ms. Montero (all AFR); Mr. Torrez (STA); Mr. Lankes, Mr. Ronci, and Mr. Das (all PDR); and Mr. Ruiz (consultant). Mr. Fajgenbaum (Deputy Director, AFR) joined the discussions during July 24-27,200 1. The missions worked together with Messrs. Araujo and McPherson from the World Bank. The February 2002 mission worked together with a MAE mission led by Mr. Ize. 2 The memorandum of economic and financial policies for the extension of the SMP was circulated to the Executive Board in February 200 1.

During the first round of discussions on the Article IV consultation in July 2001, the authorities requested a delay in the consultation to allow them more time to implement all the measures that should have been taken under the SMP. The staff also assisted the authorities in designing corrective measures in order to move toward macroeconomic stability and address serious transparency problems. There has been very limited progress since then. In finalizing the Article IV consultation discussions in February 2002, the staff encouraged the authorities to move ahead with the pending reforms, particularly those aimed at improving governance and the availability and quality of basic economic data. 5. The Fund’s activities in Angola have been conducted in close collaboration with the World Bank, as well as with the European Commission, the African Development Bank, and UN agencies. After downsizing its portfolio and recalling its resident representative in 1999, the World Bank has made any major expansion of its activities in Angola conditional on the authorities’ commitment to a coherent macroeconomic and reform program that could be supported with Fund resources. II. RECENTDEVELOPMENTS A. Political and Economic Developments 6. By early 2000, and after more than two decades of civil conflict, government forces had largely destroyed the military capability of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the rebel movement. Since then, the government has regained control of most of the country, although remaining rebel forces have resorted to sporadic guerilla raids. The recent death of the UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi, has opened up the possibility of a peace agreement and a lasting improvement in the security situation. 7. Presidential elections have been delayed for several years because of fragile security conditions; they are now expected to be held in 2003 or 2004. President dos Santos has announced that he will not run for office in the next elections. The presidential candidate for the governing party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, has not yet been chosen. In the near term, the main Angola: Social and Demographic Indicators challenges facing (Data for 1999, unless otherwise noted) the authorities are Indicators Angola Sub-Saharan Africa how to deal with extensive corruption, millions of displaced people, severe income inequality, widespread poverty, and high inflation (Text Table, Table 1).

The military advances of government forces in 1999 and early 2000 were accompanied by increased access to diamond-producing areas and fertile land. This extension of the formal economy, combined with the liberalization of the foreign exchange market in 1999 and subsequent trade liberalization measures, led to a significant increase of activity in the agricultural, manufacturing, and commerce sectors. Starting from a Angola: Real GDP Growth Rates, 1998 - 2002 relatively low level, real non-oil GDP (annual percentage change) grew, on average, by about 8 percent 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 in 2000 and 200 1, and a similar expansion is expected in 2002 (Text Real GDP growtn 0.5 3.3 3.U 3.L I IL Table).

The results also indicate that income inequality, measured as the share of expenditure of the richest decile in the population, increased during the same period. 9. The 12-month rate of inflation fell from 329 percent in 1999 to 268 percent in Monthly Inflation, January 2001 February 2002 (m percent) 2000 (compared with 150 percent under the program for that year), and subsequently to 116 percent in 2001 (compared with 75 percent under the authorities’ program, Table 1).3 There has been an increase in monthly inflation since December 200 1, highlighting the risk that, without corrective policies, the earlier gains may be short-lived (Text Figure). Since May 200 1, the central bank has followed a policy of trying to control the pace of exchange rate depreciation through intensified intervention 3 Only a small portion of the increase in the consumer price index during the last two years can be attributed to changes in administered prices. The staff has estimated that “core” inflation in 2000 and 2001 (i.e., excluding the impact of changes in fuel, water, and electricity prices) was 2 19 percent and 108 percent, respectively.

Given the pressure on monetary growth arising from underlying fiscal and quasi-fiscal imbalances, the central bank sold about US$l.2 billion in reserves during the year, and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 13 percent. Since end- 1999, the real exchange rate has appreciated by 46 percent, an undesirable development with regard to the profitability of import-competing and non- oil export sectors (Text Figure).

Higher oil prices caused a drastic improvement in the current account of the balance of payments in 1999-2000, and large direct foreign investment inflows poured into the oil sector .4 The improvement in the basic balance allowed for a significant increase in foreign assets of commercial banks and in official reserves. Gross international reserves rose from the equivalent of about 1 month of imports at end-1998 to 4.6 months at end-2000 (Table 2). Subsequently, in 2001, lower oil prices led to a small deficit in the current account. The capital account registered a surplus in that year, However, because of substantial additional financing arising from the accumulation of further external arrears and a reduction in official reserves, the balance of payments showed a discrepancy (errors and omissions) of about US$l billion5 Oil Price, Dcccmbcr 1997 December 2003 li I Net Internatmnal Reserves, December 1999 - December 2002 (U.S. dollars per barrel) (In millmns of U.S. dollars) 35 r--- -.“-__.---” ,--- 4 Angola’s foreign direct investment inflows are among the largest in sub-Saharan Africa and accounted for over 96 percent of all fixed capital formation in Angola during 1997-99. 5 These errors and omissions could reflect unrecorded outflows in either the current or the capital account. A sizable discrepancy was also estimated for 2000.

The figures mentioned above are tentative and subject to further revisions as the authorities continue to improve the quality of the database. 12. The persistence of inflation has been the result of continued monetary expansion, particularly the expansion of the monetary base (Text Figure, Table 3). In 2000, the primary sources of I Monetary Growth and Inllation base money creation were the large quasi-fiscal spending and 950 (12-month rate) 1 operational deficits of the central 850 bank of Angola, which together 750 650 amounted to 5 percent of GDP 550 (234 percent of base money at 450 end-1999). In 2001, these two 350 sources were equivalent to 250 150 3 percent of GDP and, in 50 conjunction with a rapid -5c withdrawal of government c deposits, contributed to a 187 Lm percent expansion of the monetary base in that year. The decline in the money multiplier during the last two years is explained by a rapid increase in the commercial banks’ excess reserves ratio. 13. The lack of timely and - Govcmmcnt Accounts and Fiscal Balance, 1996-2001 consistent data has made analysis and monitoring of the fiscal situation difficult. Oil revenue figures have been subject to frequent revisions, expenditure data are incomplete, and financing flows are neither regularly reconciled nor included in the fiscal accounts.

On the oil revenue side, recent work by the Ministry of Finance and consultants engaged in the diagnostic study of the oil sector has begun to shed light on the amount of oil receipts accruing to the government and to Sonangol. However, the accounting of tax and royalty payments from Sonangol is complicated by continuous arrears and the non-indexation of those arrears (Box 1). Non-oil revenues have been rising steadily since 1998, and they experienced a significant increase in 2001 owing to the outsourcing of customs administration to a private company (Table 4). However, salaries for professional staff are below market levels, there are not enough tax auditors, and enforcement of tax compliance is not very effective. Box 1. Oil Revenues Whereas the tax returns and projections by the international oil companies are reliable, reported revenues from Sonangol cannot be easily reconciled with its share of oil receipts (even after taking into account changes in the composition of production across different blocks), and the reported figures tend to underestimate returns. Further complicating the monitoring of oil revenues from Sonangol, the company assumed some time ago complete control of foreign currency receipts from the oil sector, and stopped channeling them through the central bank as mandated by the law. These receipts now go through bank accounts of subsidiaries of Sonangol abroad or through escrow accounts to service oil-guaranteed loans. These difficulties are exacerbated by continuous arrears of Sonangol on Sonangol-Treasury Arrears, 1999-2001 (In percent of GDP) 1999 2000 2001 Sonangol arrears Taxes 3.9 -0.3 6.2 Oil bonuses 3.6 -2.5 3.8 payments of taxes and oil bonuses to the treasury (see Treasury arrears below).

The treasury, Source: Angolan authorities; and staff estimates and projections. on the other hand, is also late in reimbursing Sonangol for payments made on government external debt and for fuel subsidies. The authorities have recently begun accounting for the expenditures that Sonangol makes on behalf of the state. 7 Recorded extrabudgetary outlays have been, on average, equivalent to 11 percent of GDP during the last five years. Even though these outlays have been recorded ex post as expenditures, their precise nature remains to be fully identified (Table 5). Unexplained discrepancies of between 2 percent and 23 percent of GDP arising from recorded inflows (revenue and financing) in excess of all recorded (i.e. including recorded extrabudgetary outlays) expenditures have also persisted over the years. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- 15. Since 1998, higher oil revenues and large oil signature bonuses have allowed government expenditures to increase rapidly. Public sector salaries, which had fallen to historically low levels in 1999, were increased significantly during 2000-01 (Table 5). New military equipment boosted defense expenditures during 1997-99; these expenditures fell rapidly in 2000 and 2001 (Table 5).* 16. The government has accumulated a significant amount of domestic payments arrears on goods and services in recent years. The stock of arrears up to end-1997 is estimated at US$250 million (3 percent of GDP), and the authorities have reported the accumulation of even larger amounts since then. Under the program for 200 1, the authorities were expected to have repaid the stock of pre-1997 arrears in full in equal proportions of cash to bonds. A different plan was adopted in mid-2001: small debts of up to US$O.5 million were to be paid in cash, but the conditions for repayment of larger debts began to be negotiated with suppliers on a case-by-case basis, depending on whether they intend to make new investments. B. Structural Reforms, Governance, and Transparency 17. Angola’s structural reform agenda was embedded in the 2000 SMP, and most of the measures were again reflected in the January-June 2001 SMP. Since June 2001, the authorities have continued working on a number of reforms that have a bearing on the nonoil sector, such as the privatization of Banco de Comercio e Industria (BCI)-one of the two state-owned banks-the establishment of a large-taxpayers’ unit, and the rationalization of customs exemptions. Understandings have also been reached with the World Bank on conducting a country procurement assessment later this year. By end-February 2002, about one-half of the structural and transparency-related measures that were scheduled for implementation by June 2001 had been implemented, while the remaining ones were in progress (Appendix I). 18. During 2001, prices of fuel, water, and electricity were increased by much less than had been envisaged in the government’s program, thus aggravating the financial position of the respective public companies. On fuel prices, the stipulated increases were not carried out because the authorities wanted to ensure an increase in the supply of public transportation in Luanda before raising fuel prices. By January 2002, much of the originally envisaged adjustment in domestic fuel prices had been implemented, and a formula to compensate for changes in prices and exchange rates established. The reasons for the delays incurred in raising water and electricity prices and the timing of future adjustments in water prices are not clear. 19. A privatization plan covering the period 2001-05 was approved in May 2001. The document contains appropriate modalities for privatization, but, despite the recommendations ’ The quality of the data on the nondefense categories of the functional classification is also weak. During the last five years, there have been unclassified expenditures in the functional classification of between 7 percent and 40 percent of GDP.

The plan also leaves out an important insurance company and the Banco de Poupanca e Credit0 (BPC), a large state-owned bank with severe management and accounting problems. The staff urged the authorities to reconsider their privatization plan for key infrastructure sectors in light of forthcoming recommendations from a Country Framework Report to be prepared by the World Bank. 20. Regarding the trade regime, restrictive import licensing was abolished at end- 2000, and the customs service tax was reduced from 5 percent to 2 percent in 2001. The average unweighted import tariff rate is 17 percent, with six bands and a maximum rate of 35 percent.’ On diamond exports, the authorities have granted exclusive exportation rights to a recently established semiprivate company, the Angolan Selling Corporation (Ascorp), which was also given a monopsony (right to purchase all diamonds) in the local market.]’ Many customs duty exemptions were eliminated in 2001 and early 2002, most notably exemptions of nondefense goods for the military. Exemptions remain for the petroleum and mining sectors, and for some large investment projects. The authorities expect to ratify the Southern African Development Community (SADC) free trade protocol, at the moment they have no plans to undertake further multilateral trade liberalization. 21. Angola’s financial system is undergoing rapid change, with the entry of two new banks in the last three years and the ongoing process to privatize BCI. Financial intermediation, however, remains very limited, and real deposit rates negative (Text Figure, Box 2). Macroeconomic instability has also led to a rapid process of dollarization, with foreign currency deposits accounting for about 80 percent of total deposits. There are also concerns about the management and accounting practices at the BPC. Despite these problems, the authorities do not intend to privatize the BPC, and ~ J‘ VQc?’ VJq QaLYq kqtpQ $Q QtioQ $” $’ / the bank was designated in late 200 1 the Sonrce’ N‘!,ion‘ll Banh oi‘i\ngola sole manager of budget execution. ~ 9 The Fund’s trade restrictiveness index assigns to Angola a rating of 3 (moderately open) on a O-10 scale (10 is most restructure). ‘” Ascorp is a joint venture between a state-owned company and two private companies with operations in other countries. There are no regulations in place to prevent abuse of monopsony power; the authorities have argued that complaints on price unfairness were already made at the time multiple licensed companies were operating in the market.

Angola’s Financial Sector Angola’s financial sector consists of nine commercial banks (four foreign owned), three insurance companies, one private pension fund, and a government-owned commercial bank (the Caixa Agropecuaria e Pescas, or CAP) that has been in liquidation since 2000. Two state-owned banks, BPC and BCI, constitute about half of commercial bank lending. Economic instability, undefined property rights, unrecoverable collateral, and a lack of facilities for screening borrowers have hampered financial intermediation. These factors have created incentives for banks to concentrate on low-risk central bank paper, maintain large unused reserves, and focus on trading foreign currency-denominated instruments. The ratio of broad money to GDP has remained roughly unchanged at 20 percent during the last three years, and it is well below the sub-Saharan African average of 37 percent. Capital adequacy ratios were at comfortable levels at end-2001, In relative terms, state-owned banks had the highest ratios of nonperformimg loans and the lowest capital adequacy ratios. These banks have Financial System Indicators as of December 3 1,200l also been subject to frequent recapitalizations.

Governance and transparency issues continue to be of serious concern, with corruption widespread throughout society (Box 3). There are concerns about the handling and disposition of oil and diamond concessions, revenue flows in the oil sector, the finances of Sonangol, and external borrowing practices. In the meantime, Sonangol has been managing the country’s oil proceeds through its own correspondents’ banks abroad, bypassing legislation that mandates that these funds should be channeled through the central bank. Furthermore, Sonangol has never been independently audited, and its accounting procedures are not in line with international accounting standards. An effective policy response is urgently needed to make public finances transparent, strengthen institutions, establish a system of institutional checks and balances, and improve public procurement practices.

Corruption and Governance Issues Cross-country analyses have shown a strong positive correlation between, on the one hand, easily appropriable rents arising from the exploitation of mineral resources and, on the other higher levels of corruption, slower economic growth, and higher poverty rates. According to the International Country Risk Guide, Angola is in 15’h place in a ranking of corruption among 140 countries. In a recent survey conducted by a local organization (the National Democratic Institute) among a panel of Luanda residents (including parliamentarians), the majority of those interviewed identified corruption in Angola as a “systemic problem” affecting all levels of society, particularly “the top political and administrative hierarchies”. The current legal framework was deemed appropriate to carry out an effective anti-corruption campaign, but lack of political will was listed as a major impediment. Petty corruption is widespread in Angola. Typical examples involve cases of civil servants receiving a “facilitation fee” in exchange for the processing of applications or licenses, as well as widely reported incidents involving the economic police, in which it extracts bribes from small businesses in the process of verifying compliance with operating licenses and “profit” margins. On a larger scale, corruption involves monopolistic practices maintained by political access and public banks engaging in connected lending (to companies where there was no expectation of repayment or to nonexistent ones) that eventually necessitates bailouts from the treasury. A general lack of transparency in public finances-with scant data being officially published and a complex set of offshore finances-has generated the perception of a poorly managed treasury. During the last five years, extrabudgetary expenditures and residual unexplained discrepancies in the fiscal accounts have averaged 11 percent and 12 percent of GDP per year, respectively; budget execution data has yielded a large share of expenditures as unclassified; substantial funds received as signature bonuses for oil contracts and oil royalties have been outside the control of the treasury; and nontransparent external debt transactions have been made. In addition, the mechanism for awarding diamond concessions is opaque; oil companies are pressed to donate sums to funds and foundations with little independent oversight; and the recent creation of a company with monopoly rights on the purchasing and marketing of diamonds has raised concerns about nontransparent practices that could adversely affect investments from other, reputable companies. 23. The staff also learned for the first time in 2001 about large quasi-fiscal expenditures carried out by the central bank and of a large operational deficit in the bank. l1 Preliminary results from the audit of the 1999 accounts of the central bank also pointed to serious problems in the management and accounting of international reserves, insufficient internal control mechanisms, and deficiencies in valuation and accounting adjustments. During the second half of 2001, the central bank carried out an inventory of quasi-fiscal expenditures, hired a company that will prepare a restructuring plan for the bank, and began an audit of the 2000 accounts. Little progress has been made, however, in improving internal controls and ensuring that operations regarding the management of foreign reserves are promptly recorded and accounted for. The authorities have not supplied I’ Quasi-fiscal expenditures include the operational costs of CAP and miscellaneous expenditures on behalf of the government (e.g., credit card purchases by public sector employees and payments of foreign-currency liabilities related to previous quasi-fiscal operations).

Another area of concern is the process of budget formulation and execution. The process has been negatively affected by the following problems: the National Assembly plays a limited role in the oversight of state finances, budget documents are not widely available, provincial expenditures are included in the accounting system with a long lag, external debt operations are not fully recorded in the budgetary accounts, and little importance has been attached to budgetary procedures and ceilings. Recent technical assistance missions from the European Union (EU) and the World Bank recommended the design of a new reporting system, following the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics methodology and the overhaul of the current systems of budgeting, accounting, and procurement. There have also been large, unauthorized extrabudgetary purchases by government units (most of which went into arrears) in recent years, and Sonangol has been frequently used as a partner for treasury transactions. To deal with the former problem, the authorities have set up an on-line system of control of budget execution that will be operational this year, and it will impose strict limits on spending by line ministries. 25. Angola’s monetary statistics have improved in recent years, and some data (e.g., central bank survey and exchange rates) are now provided to the Fund in a timely manner. However, the fiscal accounts are neither comprehensive nor prepared on time, and there is a need to reinforce the technical units in charge of compiling these data and follow up on outstanding technical assistance recommendations (Appendix IV). The authorities have been making efforts to update the public external debt database, but further work is needed to allow for a reconciliation of stocks and flows, and to eliminate differences with Sonangol’s debt reports. A debt-management unit was created in 2001; however, technicians are not always informed of important financial transactions, thus preventing the analysis and formulation of appropriate fiscal and debt-management policies. The solution to these problems lies in a strong commitment to transparency and accountability. III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 26. The discussions focused on the measures needed to move toward macroeconomic stability, increase the transparency of public sector operations, and revitalize the process of economic reforms. The staff pointed out that the gradual and piecemeal approach to macroeconomic stabilization and reform that was being followed was not sufficient and would do little to help the nearly 70 percent of Angolans living in poverty. The staff argued that, despite the reduction of hostilities in war zones and substantially lower military expenditures in 2000 and 2001, poverty was not being reduced because of the hesitant implementation of the government program and the persistence of severe governance and transparency problems that discouraged investment in the non-oil sector and prevented the reallocation of public resources to priority sectors (Box 4).

Corruption: The Benefits of an Effective Public Policy Response Empirical studies by Fund staff have estimated the impact of corruption on a range of socioeconomic outcomes, including economic growth, public finances, poverty, income inequality, and the provision of social services. On the basisof this work, even a slight improvement, the equivalent to a one- point increase on the Transparency International scale of l-10 (with 1 being the most corrupt), is predicted to have a number of beneficial effects in the medium term (Text Table). A one- point increase in the transparency scale would leave Angola with an estimated level of corruption still higher than in most of its neighboring countries. The benefits would likely increase if Angola were to achieve a greater improvement along the transparency scale. r Impact of Decreasing Corruption Sociocconomlc Outcome Impact Effect 1/ Real per capita GDP growth + l-l .5 percent annual change Invcstmcnt + I-2.8 Expcnditurcs on public education + 0.7-0.9 Expenditures on public health + 0.6-1.7 Income inequality (Gini cocfficicnt) - 0.9-2.1 Gini points lncomc of the lowest 20 pcrccnt + l-1.5 pcrccnt annual change Child mortality rate I, l-2.7 deaths per 1,000 live births Primary student dropout rate 1.4-4.X pcrccntagc points Pcrccnt of paved roads in good condition + 2.2-3.9 pcrccntagc points Source: Kenya, Rcccnt Econonuc Dcvclopmcnts, Section VI, SM/02/72 (2001). li In percentage points of GDP, unless otherwise indicated. J A. Macroeconomic Policies for 2002 27. The staff illustrated the advantages of adopting a shock-type approach to lower inflation, not least because of the regressive nature of the inflation tax. The authorities, however, indicated that they preferred a gradual approach to disinflation. The uncertainty over both the level of revenues and the amount and composition of expenditures in 2000 and in 2001 made it very difficult to assess the fiscal situation and formulate a realistic fiscal framework for the future. Notwithstanding these limitations, the staff worked with the authorities on a tentative economic program for 2002 aimed at lowering end-period inflation to 50 percent, achieving growth in the non-oil sector of at least 7 percent, and bringing key administered prices in line with cost recovery levels. 28. Overall GDP is expected to grow by 17 percent in 2002, mainly as a result of higher oil production from a new deepwater field. The authorities recognize that, in order to achieve their inflation target, an urgent reduction in fiscal and quasi-fiscal expenditures of about 10 percent of GDP would be required (see para. 30 below), and that such a reduction could be achieved by eliminating extrabudgetary and nonpriority expenditures and beginning to rationalize the public sector, particularly the excessive number of ministries and autonomous funds and institutions. In 2002, the external current account is projected to deteriorate because of higher oil-sector related investment imports and sluggish export growth (Table 2). While diamond exports are expected to rise in 2002, oil exports will remain subdued because the large increase expected in oil output is expected to be offset by a decline in oil prices. It is estimated that the balance of payments can accommodate an increase in gross international reserves from 2.6 months of imports at end-2001 to 2.9 months of imports at end-2002.

The National Assembly approved the 2002 budget in December 200 1, but some of its assumptions and premises need to be revised. ‘* The authorities intend to work on a revised budget with quarterly (rather than annual) revenue and expenditure projections and submit it to the National Assembly in mid-2002. Regarding the composition of expenditures, the staff expressed concern about an implied reduction in the 2002 budget in types of social expenditures in real terms compared with the 2001 budget, and a simultaneous large increase in expenditures in general public services (wages and functioning of the central government), and it recommended a shift in the opposite direction. On the repayment of domestic arrears, and to ensure a transparent and equitable process of repayment, the staff encouraged the authorities to adhere to their commitment in the SMP and avoid discrimination among creditors by repaying debts using the same proportion of cash to bonds in all cases. 30. The fiscal projections for 2002 displayed in Table 4 are based on a price of Angola’s oil of US$18 per barrel, which is in line with World Economic Outlook (WEO). The policy framework that was discussed with the authorities would allow for the overall fiscal deficit to narrow from an estimated 7.5 percent of GDP in 2001 to about 1 percent of GDP in 2002, and for total expenditures to decline by about 10 percent of GDP. The decline in the overall level of expenditure rests almost entirely on two hypothetical assumptions: (i) the elimination of the unexplained discrepancy of 10 percent of GDP; and, (ii) no major revisions to the underlying data for 200 1. In relation to (i), the staff cautioned the authorities that such a degree of fiscal adjustment would be unrealistic in the absence of decisive governance measures. 31. Oil revenues are expected to fall by 5 percent of GDP in 2002 on account of lower oil prices and higher investment recovery costs in newer fields. This decline in oil revenues will be slightly offset by higher non-oil revenues from the ongoing tax and customs administration reforms, namely, the rationalization of customs exemptions, the privatization of customs management, and the creation of a large-taxpayers’ unit. On the expenditure side, the authorities intend to better control budgeted expenditures in 2002 and reduce subsidies on fuels and utility prices by bringing administered prices in line with cost recovery levels. The overall wage bill would be kept constant in real terms, and capital expenditure would increase by about 1.5 percent of GDP. 32. On tax policy, the authorities intend to rationalize the tax system during the next three years, beginning with the establishment of a single sales tax with broad coverage in 2002, the rationalization of income and profit taxes in 2003, and the establishment of a single ‘* The staff emphasized the need for the new budget to explain the nature of extrabudgetary expenditures and unexplained discrepancies in 2000 and 200 1, and whether these have been eliminated or included in the 2002 budgetary accounts. The budget should also contain a disaggregated table in dollar terms of outstanding foreign loans, expected new loans and disbursements, and oil-related revenues (including the total amount of oil bonuses received and their proposed disposition); and display domestic and foreign financing assumptions below the line.

On tax administration, a large-taxpayers unit and a fiscal reform committee to coordinate tax and customs reforms have been created. The modernization project at customs is proceeding, and customs revenue collection has grown by 47 percent in dollar terms since a new company took control of customs administration in the port of Luanda in early 200 1. However, various bureaucratic procedures remain to be dismantled to expedite the clearance of goods, customs staff suffer from low morale and a complex compensation system, and the purview of the new company does not yet extend to other ports and borders. 33. The staff noted that, while some of the appreciation of the real exchange rate in 2000 was partly related to the improvement in Angola’s terms of trade, the continued appreciation in 200 1 was the result of a policy of de facto exchange rate-based stabilization, coupled with an expansionary fiscal stance. The staff encouraged the Angola: Government accounts, 1999 - 2002 authorities to maintain the spirit of Angola’s flexible exchange rate regime,13 focusing on achieving their international reserve accumulation and monetary targets, and limiting their foreign exchange market intervention to the smoothing out of excessive volatility. The authorities agreed that the continuation of foreign exchange market intervention without concrete measures to reduce public spending was not sustainable. 1999 2000 200 1 2002 (In percent of GDP) RWCIIUCS 46.8 51.7 41.1 37.8 Expenditures 82.6 60.7 48.6 38.5 Ofwhich : Discrepancy Ii 18.6 4.1 9.6 0.0 Overall balance (before grants) -35.7 -9.0 -7.5 -0.7 (In millions of U.S. dollars) Revenues 2,852 4,586 3,938 3,719 Expenditures 5,028 5,380 4,669 3,788 Ofwhich : Discrepancy 11 1,132 415 907 0 Overall balance (before grants) -2,176 -794 -73 I -69 Source: Angolan authorities; and staff estimates and projections. Ii A positive sign means that total inflows exceed recorded spending. 34. The monetary program for 2002 assumes a small increase in velocity because of inflation inertia (money growth is slightly below nominal non-oil GDP growth). There is an increase in net international reserves of US$200 million, and a similar increase in net government deposits at the central bank. The authorities are aware of the need to ensure a controlled expansion in reserve money, as well as to control public spending, rather than finance the public sector deficit with central bank bills or government securities. Regarding central bank quasi-fiscal expenditures, progress has been made in mapping expenditures made on behalf of the government and in transferring those expenditures to the treasury. The staff encouraged the authorities to complete without delay the settlement with the treasury of all debts remaining from previous operations and to eliminate (or move to the treasury account) all remaining fiscal expenditures executed by the central bank. l3 There is an official interbank market and an informal market (a cash market). The latter is used by residents to acquire dollars and dispose of illegal diamond receipts. The spread between the official and the informal market exchange rates has typically been below 10 percent after the foreign exchange market was significantly liberalized in mid-1999, and it exists because capital account restrictions prevent domestic residents from converting domestic currency deposits into foreign currency at commercial banks.

The authorities agreed on the need to implement all the measures contained in the January-June 2001 SMP. They also stated that, during 2002, fuel, water, and electricity prices would be raised to match cost recovery levels as had been intended in 2000 and 2001. 36. Consultants have been working on a diagnostic study of the oil sector, which is seen as an important tool for improving oil revenue management in the medium term. The study, originally scheduled for completion by mid-2002, has been proceeding at a slower-than- expected pace, mainly because the necessary data on the central bank and on external loans were not provided to the consultants (Box 5). The authorities stated that they were about to hand over to the consulting company outstanding data on foreign loans and the accounts of the central bank, so that the study might proceed. Box 5. Diagnostic Study of the Oil Sector Based on an initiative presented to the authorities by the staffs of the Fund and the World Bank in 1996, understandings were reached on a diagnostic study of the oil sector in early 2000, and work by an international consulting company began in early 2001. The study consists of an initial and a final report with analysis and recommendations, and a series of quarterly updates on the design of a model to monitor and forecast oil revenues. The study has three main objectives: (i) make recommendations for institutional and regulatory improvements, (ii) analyze the flows and recording of revenues between Sonangol, the central bank, and the treasury; and (iii) develop a detailed model to monitor and forecast those revenues. Work on the first two items has proceeded slowly, mainly because the data on the central bank accounts and external loans was not provided to the consultants. A preliminary draft of the initial report made reference to insufficient reconciliation procedures between Sonangol, the central bank, and the treasury, but was unable to analyze the respective flows because of insufficient data. The report also identified the need to improve the accounting standards of Sonangol, reflect on the changes that are required to avoid a conflict of interest arising from Sonangol’s dual role as concessionaire and operating partner in certain blocks, and assess the procurement practices of the company. Work on the revenue model has proceeded at a faster pace; a preliminary version of the model has been installed at the Ministry of Finance and should be completed this summer. As an auditing tool, the model will allow for the verification of tax payments on a company-by-company basis. As an analytical tool, the model will allow the simulation of the revenue impact of different assumptions on oil prices and the pace of production. The success of this work will depend on future efforts by the authorities to preserve the quality of the inputs and assign adequate counterparts to maintain the model and run policy scenarios. 37. The lack of financial discipline and accountability in the public sector has triggered a massive accumulation of arrears among public enterprises and the central government. The government has made an inventory of these debts and proceeded to cancel outstanding cross debts. For companies with net debtor positions, the government intends to capitalize them, improve management through performance management contracts, and introduce regular financial reporting requirements. The staff pointed out, however, that, while management contracts might help viable companies (and public banks) to survive, privatization or private sector involvement in the form of strategic partners would, in most cases, be the superior choice. The staff also recommended an analysis of the financial viability of these companies and the introduction of financial discipline and enforceable penalties for managers prior to any capitalization.

On the handling of budget execution through the BPC, the authorities agreed on the need to establish provisions to limit the amount of daily balances kept by the government in its BPC account, to effect all payments by check, and to build an on-line connection of this account to the central bank and the treasury. 39. Regarding the protocol of financial relations between the central bank and the treasury, and considering the need to entrust the central bank with the responsibility to clear oil-related proceeds currently managed by Sonangol, the staff suggested that Sonangol should also be part of the arrangement. The authorities stated that they would like to ensure that the protocol was based on the principles of central bank independence, transparency, and efficiency in the management of resources. To this end, the staff discussed with the authorities four main recommendations: (i) all foreign currency receipts should transit through and be accounted by the central bank14; (ii) all types of government revenue (including diamond receipts) must transit through the single treasury account at the central bank; (iii) all quasi-fiscal operations should be settled with fiscal resources and transferred to the treasury; and (iv) any deposits of the government or Sonangol should be remunerated at market interest rates, and any outstanding liabilities should bear market rates. While agreeing in principle with items (iii) and (iv), the authorities stated that they were not sure that enough political consensus could be achieved regarding items (i) and (ii). 40. Angola has removed most restrictions under Article VIII but continues to maintain an exchange restriction in the form of limits on the remittances of dividends and profits from foreign investments that do not exceed US$250,000. Angola also maintains the following exchange restrictions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2: limits on the availability of foreign exchange for certain invisible transactions, such as travel, medical, and educational allowances; and limits on unrequited transfers to nonresidents. The limits on the value of imports that could be made without explicit authorization have been abolished. C. Other Transparency and Data Issues 41. Oil exploration bonuses, or up-front payments from the oil companies to the government for exploration rights, have been a common feature in Angola’s oil contracts in recent years. The allocation of these bonuses is decided by the presidency in conjunction with Sonangol, and even though they are identified as income in the budget, their use is not normally recorded in the fiscal accounts. The most recent bonuses involved a large ultra- deepwater block auctioned in September 2001. The authorities reported receiving US$285 million for this block in October 2001 and are planning to transfer these funds to the budgetary accounts in March or April 2002. The delay in effecting this transfer could not be explained, except by the fact that these funds are outside the control of the treasury. More important, this amount is lower than the payments for the treasury of about US$400 million l4 Except those that are earmarked to service oil-guaranteed debt. If any of Sonangol’s offshore accounts remain open, limits should be placed on the respective balances, and monthly statements of these accounts should be submitted regularly to the central bank and the treasury.

The authorities stated that they could not provide any supporting documentation on these payments because of confidentiality agreements with the oil companies. 42. The authorities agreed with the staff on the need for an independent financial audit of Sonangol and for an eventual alignment of Sonangol accounts with international accounting standards. They have not yet decided, however, on the timing for these actions. Problems of tax arrears of Sonangol and fuel subsidy arrears of the government persisted throughout 2001 and early 2002. The mission suggested a number of actions to deal with the problem, including the setting up of an automatic mechanism for the payment of fuel subsidies to Sonangol. However, the magnitude of Sonangol’s operational deficit is far from clear, and it may actually lie at the heart of the problem of its tax arrears. The authorities also agreed with the need to prevent Sonangol from executing expenditures on behalf of the state and to settle all pending tax and subsidy arrears, but they pointed out that there were political constraints and practical difficulties involved in changing current practices. The authorities also expressed reservations about the staffs recommendation to publish an account of all oil revenue flows on a regular basis. 43. Regarding external borrowing, the staff noted that it was fundamental to assess the rationale, costs, and benefits of contracting large-scale oil-guaranteed loans. One of the most recent transactions of this sort involved the use of a US$600 million medium-term oil- guaranteed loan contracted in mid-200 1 to prepay to an intermediating company part of the US$1.9 billion of Angola’s debt to Russia.” Initially, the authorities did not provide information to the staff on this loan and on the respective debt operation. In early 2002, the authorities explained that the intermediary helped facilitate the sales of arms to Angola and that a total of US$1.5 billion had already been paid to this company. The company had, in turn, bought the entire debt from Russia at an unspecified price. The staff does not know the full details of this transaction.16 The staff requested documentation on this and other oil- guaranteed external loans to ascertain terms and conditions, and reconcile them with stock and flow figures from the external debt database. The authorities stated that they were not able to give details of these loans because it would infringe on their national sovereignty. Given the increased secrecy of Angola’s external borrowing practices, the staff recommended that all external public sector loans be documented, disclosed to the public, and submitted to the National Assembly for approval. The authorities felt that such a level of transparency vis- a-vis parliament and civil society would be too intrusive on government affairs. l5 Angola had renegotiated its debt to Russia in 1996, obtaining a 70 percent discount on its US$5 billion debt. The new loan for US$1.9 billion had a 5-year grace period, a 15-year maturity, and a 6 percent market interest rate. l6 In late February 2002, the Swiss authorities impounded an account at a Swiss bank where funds were held by individuals linked to this operation.

On the budget process and recording, the staff stressed the need to ensure that the budget was comprehensive and implemented as approved by parliament, to strengthen the role of the National Assembly and the newly created accounting tribunal in the oversight of state finances, and to make budget documents widely available. Most crucially, the discussions centered on the need to either include in the fiscal accounts or eliminate all extrabudgetary revenues and expenditures and identify the nature of the discrepancies between revenues, financing, and recorded spending. The discussions also revolved around the need to reduce the number of autonomous funds and institutions (92 in total) and reflect their operations in the budget. The 2002 budget has increased its coverage to include most of these funds and major public companies, and the authorities stated that they were considering eliminating most of the autonomous funds and institutions. An external website in the Ministry of Finance, which would include the budget document, is under development. The staff also encouraged the authorities to follow up on the recommendations of the recent technical assistance mission from the EU to improve every stage of the budget cycle, including the design of a new reporting system and the overhaul of the current systems of budgeting, accounting, and procurement. D. Interim PRSP 45. The government has prepared a draft interim poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) and is now revising the document based on comments received from the staffs of the World Bank and the Fund, UN agencies, and the EU. A new version of the document is expected to be available this summer. The staff encouraged the authorities to frame a development plan within the PRSP approach, and to proceed with the design and implementation of a poverty reduction strategy regardless of whether a Fund-supported program was in place. The authorities are aware that, to be credible and effective, the strategy will need to be based on a broad-based ownership of the PRSP process; concrete objectives and targets linked to a response to the problem of nearly 4 million displaced people; a three-year comprehensive financing plan showing how the country’s resources will be allocated; and decisive measures to combat corruption and improve transparency and accountability. E. Medium-Term Prospects 46. The staff discussed with the authorities the need for a comprehensive program of economic reforms that could allow Angola to reach its full economic potential. A medium- term macroeconomic scenario with these characteristics was prepared, assuming a continued improvement in the security situation over the next five years. The scenario assumes fiscal consolidation and a monetary stance aimed at reducing inflation to single-digit levels by 2004; governance and transparency-related measures; a reduction and redirection of expenditure toward social sectors and infrastructure; and the implementation of a meaningful privatization program (Box 6 and Table 6). The authorities are aware of the advantages of such a program but pointed to political constraints on their implementation. They suggested that they prefer to continue with a gradual and selective process of reform for the foreseeable future. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - Box 6. Medium-Term Scenario The oil price projection is based on the January 2002 World Economic Outlook database. After a decline in 200 1, the price of Angola’s oil is projected to stabilize at about US$l8 per barrel. The investment boom in the petroleum and diamond sectors is expected to continue. During the next five years, it is expected that the investment-GDP ratio will remain at over 30 percent, oil production will almost triple its 2001 level, and the non-oil economy will grow at an average rate of 8 percent (Text Figure). The fiscal scenario is based on a sustained reduction of expenditure as a share of GDP over time, supported by the downsizing of the state apparatus and civil service reform. A change in the composition of expenditures away from defense and general administration and into health, education, social security and welfare, and infrastructure is also modeled. In nominal terms, the scenario includes estimated fiscal costs of the reconstruction efforts (i.e., capital expenditures) of about US$5 billion over the next five years. Oil revenues will increase only after 2004, the result of high up-front investment costs in newer deepwater fields. Expected tax reform and the ongoing changes in tax and customs administration would lead to a continuous increase in non-oil revenues. The fiscal balance would improve rapidly, thereby facilitating the immediate elimination of bank credit to the government and bringing inflation down to single-digit levels.

In the context of an eventual Fund-supported program, the scenario assumes a rescheduling of the stock of pre- cutoff-date debt arrears on Naples terms, the virtual elimination of public sector foreign borrowing on commercial terms, and additional concessional Angola:Kcy Macrocconomlc lnd!calorj 2001.07 borrowing and grants to close the financing gap in the near term.

The main downside risks of these projections are a decline in world oil prices and a slowdown in key reforms. Sensitivity analysis suggests that exports would fall by about USSSOO million per year (4 percent of GDP) for every dollar of decline in oil prices from the baseline scenario. Slowdown or nonimplementation of key reforms could significantly reduce foreign direct investment and donors’ aid, and lead to a suboptimal use of resources and the unnecessary mortgaging of future oil proceeds.

The experience with recent technical assistance on monetary statistics, monetary policy, the money market, and foreign exchange market operations has been broadly satisfactory. There is a need for technical assistance in the areas of central bank accounting, auditing, and internal controls. In the fiscal area, the authorities need to hire additional staff to reinforce the units in charge of oil tax accounting, fiscal statistics, and foreign debt, and to follow up on the recommendations from a previous technical assistance mission on fiscal statistics. The staff also expressed its readiness to be involved in the coordination of a possible technical assistance program on revenue management and public accounting and budgeting that could be financed by the World Bank and other donors. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 48. More than two decades of civil conflict, economic mismanagement, and poor governance has left Angola with a large and inefficient state sector, widespread poverty, and weak institutions, despite massive increases in petroleum and diamond export earnings. These distortions have hindered the development of the non-oil sector and restricted the formation of human capital; while the social fabric has been stretched by extensive inequalities in the distribution of income. 49. During the last two years, the Angolan government initiated a process of economic reform, supported much of the time by staff-monitored programs. Under these programs, the trade regime was significantly liberalized, the management of customs was contracted out to a private company, and a diagnostic study of the oil sector and an external audit of the central bank were initiated. However, the implementation of these and other measures experienced numerous delays, and critical issues related to the transparency of public finances were not addressed. 50. The increase in oil prices during 2000-01 and the de-escalation of the armed conflict provided an opportunity to begin the long-awaited reconstruction of the country. While military expenditures during this period fell substantially and some infrastrncture work was carried out in Luanda, spending on health, education, and other vital infrastructure did not increase much, and the combination of unproductive expenditures and governance problems deepened poverty and aggravated an already critical humanitarian situation. Further de- escalation of the conflict and the prospects for a lasting improvement in the security situation after the death of the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi have brought to the forefront the need to address the humanitarian situation and tackle the problem of widespread poverty. 51. Limited progress has been made toward stabilizing the economy during the last two years. The fiscal deficit has been reduced, and inflation has been on a declining trend. Both the deficit and inflation, however, have remained above acceptable levels. The recent decline in oil-related proceeds and the present low level of foreign exchange reserves risk renewed macroeconomic instability. To prevent this, the authorities need to adopt a stabilization program centered on an aggressive anti-inflation strategy, the reduction of nonpriority and extrabudgetary expenditures at all levels of government, and the observance of borrowing and spending ceilings within the budget.

As the country’s net oil receipts are projected to be relatively constant over the next two years, it is important to take the opportunity to begin financing the pressing task of national reconstruction and poverty reduction through a comprehensive program of economic reforms and improvements in governance. These changes could bring about increases in foreign aid and favorable terms for new external borrowing. To build support for this program, a consultative process with civil society and the formulation of a poverty reduction strategy would also be essential. This program should be centered on macroeconomic stability, a fight against corruption, carefully targeted social programs, public enterprise reform and privatization, and private sector development. An alternative, piecemeal approach to economic reforms, combined with insufficient steps to improve transparency and governance and with further recourse to expensive and socially suboptimal foreign financing, would do little to help the majority of Angolans living in poverty and to ensure sustainable development. 53. Governance issues remain the most serious concern, and measures to increase transparency should be the top priority. In particular, the lack of transparency regarding oil sector flows and external debt operations undermine the budgetary process and public accountability, and hamper the formulation of public policies. To address these problems, it is essential to: l 54. Revisit Sonangol’s roles and responsibilities. The company should stop effecting payments on behalf of the state, its finances and operations should be externally audited and published, its accounts need to be prepared in accordance with international accounting standards, and its complex offshore finances should be unwound. Ensure that all revenues and expenditures transit through the treasury account at the central bank, that all foreign exchange is channeled through the central bank, that all public revenues and expenditures are recorded in the fiscal accounts, and that all external borrowing undergoes a careful cost-benefit analysis. Begin periodic publication of all types of government revenue and foreign debt flows, and ensure that all external loans and all oil and diamond contracts of over US$lO million are publicly disclosed in advance and approved by the National Assembly (not just by the Economic Commission of the Assembly). Restructure the central bank, rationalize its expenditures, and implement the auditors’ recommendations on internal controls and accounting procedures. Strengthen the quality of fiscal and external debt data by empowering technicians with access to information and by implementing the recommendations of recent technical assistance missions from STA. The budget process needs to be revamped. Monthly treasury plans have to be subject to the quarterly budget rather than an ad hoc decision-making process, the operating budget of the central bank should be submitted to parliament in conjunction with the annual budget, and both the budget and the budget execution reports should be made publicly available. Lastly, the newly created accounting tribunal should be empowered to audit the budget process and to act on the public’s behalf.

An independent assessment of the diamond sector and its overall governance framework needs to be undertaken. The evaluation would cover diamond smuggling from alluvial mining areas, an evaluation of the impact of smuggling on the incentive structure and pricing practices, and an analysis of recent institutional changes involving the creation of a single commercialization channel. 56. During 1999-2000, a flexible exchange rate system worked well in Angola’s high- inflation environment, eliminating major misalignments in the real exchange rate. The de facto departure from an independent floating system during 2001 is not sustainable. The staff encourages the authorities to adhere to the former system and to focus their stabilization efforts on achieving their targets on monetary aggregates and on foreign exchange reserves. 57. Liberalization of the trade and the foreign exchange regimes in recent years has helped the revival of the non-oil economy. To sustain this success, there is a need to curb corruption and strengthen property rights. The number and functions of the 27 ministries and 92 autonomous institutions and funds need to be rationalized without delay to ensure the effective delivery of public services. The economic and the fiscal police have to be dismantled in order for the non-oil economy to thrive, and a consultative study to address all forms of corruption needs to be undertaken, preferably in the context of the PRSP process. In addition, the privatization agenda needs to be revisited: large enterprises with a multiplier effect on the rest of the economy and unviable companies should be subject to reporting and publication requirements and should begin a process of privatization or private sector participation. For monopolies, this course of action should be preceded by liberalization of their respective sectors within an appropriate regulatory framework, with a view to fostering competition and avoiding the creation of distortionary private monopolies. 58. Despite the entry of new banks into Angola’s banking sector in recent years, financial intermediation continues to play a negligible role in the economy. To address this problem, inflation needs to be brought down considerably, the authority of banking supervision needs to be strengthened, and enforceable collaterals and a system of credit screening should be established. Without these changes, there is the risk that an opaque and concentrated bank industry will develop, and that business groups with industrial and official affiliations will have privileged ownership stakes and continued access to connected lending. The staff commends the authorities for proceeding with the privatization of the BCI, but it sees no reason to continue delaying the liquidation of the CAP. Considering the management and accounting problems at the BPC, hiring a foreign management team for the bank and proceeding with its immediate privatization could be extremely beneficial. 59. The authorities indicated that they were not interested in another SMP, in part because they preferred not to be tied to public commitments and timetables. Loose and informal monitoring by Fund staff, however, is not likely to provide a basis for establishing a track record that could lead to a Fund-supported program. Furthermore, current problems related to the availability and quality of basic data make it very difficult to formulate a meaningful economic program. As a first step, critical transparency problems, particularly related to the disclosure of information on external debt operations, the amounts of oil-related flows, the management of foreign reserves of the central bank, and the nature of the large Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - discrepancies in the fiscal accounts, would need to be addressed. Such a step requires political commitment, much more than it does technical assistance. 60. Angola continues to maintain an exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII in the form of limits on remittances of dividends and profits from foreign investments. In the absence of a timetable for the elimination of this exchange restriction, the staff does not recommend that the Executive Board approve the retention by Angola of this exchange restriction; but instead it recommends that the Executive Board urge Angola to eliminate this restriction as soon as possible. The staff also recommends that the Executive Board encourage Angola to reduce its reliance on the exchange restrictions maintained in accordance with the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2. 61. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Angola be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The Fund takes this decision relating to Angola’s exchange measure subject to Article VIII, Section 2(a), and in concluding the 2002 Article XIV consultation with Angola, in the light of the 2002 Article IV consultation with Angola conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in SM/02/87, Angola continues to maintain two exchange restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions in accordance with the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2, except that the exchange restrictions resulting from limits on the remittances of dividends and profits from foreign investments that do not exceed US$250,000 are subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). The Fund encourages Angola to reduce its reliance on the exchange restrictions maintained under the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2 and eliminate them as soon as its balance of payments position permits, and urges Angola to eliminate the exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) as soon as possible.

Since then, parallel market rates remained, with some exceptions, within a range of plus or minus 10 percent of commercial banks’ rates. The National Bank of Angola (BNA) fixes a reference rate for its transactions and those on behalf of the government on the basis of a weighted average of market rates. VIII. Article IV Consultation: Angola is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV discussions were held in Luanda during March 23-Apri13, 2000 and at headquarters on May 17, 2000. The Executive Board concluded the consultation on July 19,200O (EBS/OO/lO). IX. Article VIII and XIV Restrictions Article VIII. During 1999, Angola removed most restrictions under Article VIII when exchange rate transactions were liberalized and a new trade regime was approved. Angola maintains an exchange restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII in the form of limits on remittances of profits and dividends from foreign investments of up to $250,000.

An eighth project was approved some six months after fighting resumed; a ninth in late 1995, after the signing of the Lusaka Protocol; a tenth in early 1998 to support the then expected return of internally displaced populations to their communities (Social Action I); and finally an eleventh project was approved in June 2000 (this was Social Action II, a successor project to the Bank’s 1998 project). These operations are summarized in the table below: Status of IDA Lending Operations As of February 28,2002 Sector/Project Board approval date Effective Date Closing Amount of IDA date credit (net of Undis- cancellation) bursed I!

If the dialogue between the authorities and the Fund on an economic reform program advances, and once Angola has clearly placed itself on a critical path to a formal program with the Fund, the Bank will be in a position to discuss with the authorities a scaling up of its activities in the country, accompanied by a strengthening of its Country Office. Currently, the Bank is finalizing a new Economic Management Technical Assistance credit, and an identification mission for a Second Education project has already taken place. The Bank is also preparing a Transition Support Strategy (TSS) that will evaluate the scope of its possible future activities in Angola.

Monetary data hve improved in recent years, but serious deficiencies remain in the fiscal, external, and real sector statistics. National accounts and prices. The national accounts have been subject to numerous revisions, and there are breaks in time series and inconsistencies across sectors. Annual GDP at constant prices is estimated at previous-year prices using tentative deflators. Official estimates are produced only for GDP by industry, while estimates of GDP by expenditure are not produced. In addition, disaggregated data on manufacturing production are rarely available, and the data on agricultural production include only rough estimates. The consumer price index (CPI) is based on a basket of goods and services for which prices are collected in Luanda. The CPI weights were revised in January 2002 based on a household survey conducted in 2001. There is no wholesale price index. Money and banking statistics. The authorities introduced a new plan of accounts for financial institutions and initiated compilation of data on foreign assets and liabilities in accordance with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). This will contribute to a clearer sectorization of the economy and the proper classification of financial instruments in the plans of accounts of the central bank and the commercial banks. If implemented, the recent recommendations of an external audit of the accounts of the central bank will improve accounting procedures and the quality of the monetary data. Pending problems include delays in compiling monetary statistics due to weak accounting procedures in state-owned banks. A recent monetary and financial statistics mission advised the authorities to complete the derivation of the monetary survey from available on-line commercial banks and central bank balance sheet data. There is a need to strengthen the central bank’s internal control procedures, particularly with regard to external transactions, and to follow a consistent approach on the valuation adjustment of foreign currency- denominated accounts. Fiscal accounts. Although a system of accounts has been in place at the Ministry of Finance for some time, it is not yet fully operational. There are major problems in the data, particularly with respect to the accounting of oil revenues, grants, and expenditures. Large extrabudgetary expenditures and their financing (largely by external borrowing) are not accounted for in budget execution data. There are also serious problems with the registration of loan disbursements and debt service, and with the tracking and accounting of domestic and external arrears. Lastly, there are also differences between domestic and external financing data managed by the Ministry of Finance and by the central bank. For capital expenditure, the classification system provides little analytic insight, and coverage is incomplete. Angola has reported data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) for the last two years, but the data have not been published because of inconsistencies and reliability problems. Most recommendations from an STA mission in June 2000 remain to be implemented. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - APPENDIX IV External sector. The balance of payments compiled by the central bank is derived for the most part from the exchange transactions channeled through the central bank and suffers from a number of deficiencies. The main problems include difficulties in collecting data on the operations of the oil companies and on the overseas accounts of large enterprises, in recording of the debt restructuring and debt forgiveness with Russia, and in reconciling stocks and flows of external debt. There is also an inadequate classification of transactions in the central bank’s Exchange Flow Plan, weak import data, and a lack of reliable data on foreign direct investment. The data reported in the goods, services and income components are limited, and essential details in the financial account are not reported. There are also substantial lags in the dissemination of the data. The authorities have adopted the classification outlined in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Regarding debt transactions, the authorities have been making efforts to update the public debt database and include the debt of Sonangol, further work is required to reconcile differences between the database and Sonangol’s debt reports, both in terms of debt service and stocks. Ongoing technical assistance from UNCTAD to install a new debt-management software (DMFAS), create a new database, and train personnel has been proceeding slowly.
