The unemployment rate rose to 10 percent at end-June 2001 from 9% percent at end-2000 and inflation remained low. The external current account deficit was projected to remain unchanged at 5 percent of GDP in 2001, largely financed by long-term project finance and private capital inflows. The September 11 attack on the United States caused a significant further decline in tourism, with real GDP projected to decline by 2 percent and the current account deficit to widen to 6% percent of GDP in 200 1. The fiscal year 2001/02 budget adopted in March 2001 aimed for higher growth by accelerating implementation of public investment projects and envisaged an increase in the central government deficit. In view of the economic slowdown and consequent drop-off in revenue collections, the August 2001 policy statement announced steps to enhance revenue collections and reduce domestically financed capital expenditure so as to contain the central government deficit and limit accumulation of public debt. Policy Issues: The government’s economic objectives are to recover from the expected recession in 2001 and 2002 brought on by the September 11 attack and to achieve sustainable growth and increase employment over the medium term. The strategy maintains tourism as the lead sector but intensifies the diversification effort towards development of agriculture, manufacturing, and information services. Central to this strategy is the need to maintain a high level of public savings over the medium term to help finance public investment projects supported by multilateral loans and focused on infrastructure, environmental protection, and education. Toward this end, the authorities intend to freeze hiring, cut domestically financed capital expenditure, and urge public enterprises to adopt measures to reduce operating costs and move toward rate structures more closely linked to cost. To limit the immediate impact of the September 11 attack on tourism and employment, salaries in the tourism sector have been cut, with broader wage reductions under consideration to protect employment and maintain external competitiveness. The central bank has adopted an indicative lending rate to encourage commercial banks to lower lending rates to the private sector. The staff has cautioned that the introduction of an indicative rate runs counter to other steps being taken towards financial liberalization, The authorities continue to strengthen the financial sector, both onshore and offshore, by improving its regulation and supervision. Barbados is expected to participate in the FSAP for discussion in the 2002 Article IV consultation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- 1. INTR~DIJCTI~N 1. The 200 1 Article IV consultation discussions with Barbados were conducted in Bridgetown during July 17-3 1,200 1 .i Barbados representatives included the director of finance and economic affairs, the governor of the central bank, and other senior government officials; the staff also met with representatives of labor, banks, and private business. Relations with the Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) are summarized in Attachments I, II, and III, respectively.2 Barbados has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The Fund’s Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC), which will coordinate technical assistance to Caribbean countries, was established in Barbados in September 2001. 2. In concluding the 2000 Article IV consultation on November 1,2000, Executive Directors commended the authorities for policies contributing to price stability, economic growth, and reduction in unemployment. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to sound fiscal and wage policies, including increasing public savings over the medium term. Directors shared the authorities’ concerns regarding the projected weakening of the finances of the public pension system, and urged timely reform to secure workers’ old age incomes. Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to improve the regulation and supervision of offshore financial services. 3. The government regularly reports economic and financial statistics, but weaknesses impede a satisfactory assessment of economic developments in some areas. In particular, the finances of public enterprises could only be partially assessed because of shortcomings in reporting and monitoring. The reporting of national income accounts, nonbank domestic financial sector activity, and private external capital flows need to be improved to provide a more complete picture of economic and financial developments. ’ The mission comprised Mr. Pellechio (Head), Mr. 0. Williams, Ms. Eble, and Ms. Villarroel (staff assistant) (all WHD), Mr. Lybek (MAE), and Mr. Visconti (World Bank). Mr. Whitehall, Advisor to the Executive Director for Barbados, and Mr. Thomas (IDB) joined the mission for its second week. Mr. E. Williams, Senior Advisor (WHD), and Mr. Bernes, Executive Director, participated in the final round of discussions. 2 The World Bank approved a HIV/AIDS project, even though Barbados graduated from IBRD lending in 1993, based on the strong public goods and externalities rationale for including Barbados and its leadership role in controlling communicable disease in the region.

Real growth averaged 3% percent annually during 1996-98 in a framework of sound liscal and wage policies, which have helped preserve Barbados’ external competitiveness in the context of its fixed exchange rate-the Barbados dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1975. Barbados continues to have the highest United Nations human development index in the Caribbean region and a poverty rate of less than 20 percent. 5. In 2000 a strong rebound in tourism, construction, and sugar output contributed to an estimated real GDP growth of 3 percent, up from 23/ percent in 1999 when the closing of some hotels for refurbishing led to a decline in tourism (Table 1). Growth continued in the first quarter of 200 1, but preliminary estimates indicate that real GDP declined in the second quarter owing to the slowdown in the United States, Canada, and Europe, which adversely affected tourism. Reflecting this decline, the unemployment rate increased to 10 percent at end-June 2001 from 9% percent at end-2000. 6. Inflation rose from 3 percent at end-1999 to 3% percent at end-2000, mainly due to increases in petroleum and food prices, and is projected to moderate to 23/4 percent during 2001. Barbados’ real effective exchange rate appreciated by 6 percent during 2000 and 2 percent through July 2001 mainly due to appreciation of the U.S. dollar (Figure 1). 7. The overall balance of the consolidated public sector shifted from a surplus of l/2 percent of GDP in fiscal year 1999/2000 to a small deficit in 2000/01 (fiscal year is April-March) (Table 2). This weakening reflected a deterioration in the finances of the main public enterprises (transport board, water authority, and national housing corporation), as well as higher government spending on transfers and capital projects (Table 3). 8. The central government deficit in fiscal year 2000/01 was covered mainly by long-term external project finance. Domestic debt of the nonfinancial public sector declined from 23% percent of GDP at end-1999 to 20% percent of GDP at end-2000, helped by some repayment of banking system debt. Public external debt increased from 19 percent at end-1999 to 23 percent of GDP at end-2000 (Table 4), broadly offsetting the decline in domestic debt and leaving total public debt about level at 43 percent of GDP. 9. After increasing in the three previous years, the external current account deficit declined in 2000 to 5 percent of GDP (US$133 million) from 6 percent in 1999, as strong import of consumer goods and capital goods for investment in tourism facilities subsided and tourism receipts grew with the completion of these facilities (Table 5). 10. The government’s external commercial borrowing in June 2000 (US$lOO million or 4 percent of GDP) contributed to increasing gross international reserves to the equivalent of four months of imports of goods and services. This increase represented a precautionary build-up of reserves to address balance of payments pressures that may arise as a consequence of trade and financial liberalization or unexpected external developments.

Broad money expanded by 8% percent in 2000, reflecting the increase in base money owing to the build-up in international reserves net of government deposits (Table 6). As evidence of an economic slowdown became more pronounced, the central bank eased monetary policy, by reducing the minimum deposit rate, discount rate, and unremunerated cash reserve requirement.3 The domestic treasury bill rate declined from 6 percent at end- 1999 to below 4 percent at end-2000,2 percentage points below the U.S. treasury bill rate (Figure 2 and Table 7), reflecting high domestic liquidity in the context of controls on capital transactions. Domestic lending rates, however, did not decrease significantly and credit to the private sector grew only by a modest 2% percent in 2000. In response, the central bank introduced an indicative lending rate in July 2001 with a view to reducing the spread between banks’ lending and deposit rates to its historical level of about 7 percent.4 12. Banking system indicators continued to show improvement. Nonperforming loans of onshore banks have reportedly declined from 5% percent of total loans at end-1999 to 5 percent at end-2000 (Table 8). The number of offshore banks increased from 45 at end- 1999 to 52 at end-2000 (Box 1). Their total assets remained about 8% times GDP, while profits declined from 3% percent of total assets at end-1999 to % percent at end-2000 owing to increased provisioning for loans and investments. 13. The privatization of the Barbados National Bank (BNB) and Insurance Corporation of Barbados (ICB) were initiated in December 2000 with a public offering of shares. These offerings were under subscribed owing mainly to timing. The government now owns 72 percent of the BNB and 60 percent of the ICB. 14. The public sector investment program (PSIP) continues to focus on transportation infrastructure and environmental protection, primary and secondary education, and tourism. The education sector enhancement program (EduTech), a US$213 million project financed by the IDB and Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) to improve the physical facilities and curriculum of the national education system, has progressed well into the second phase of implementation. 3 The minimum deposit rate was reduced from 5 to 4% percent on September 1,2000, to 4 percent on April 1,200 1, and to 3 YZ percent on July 18,200l. The central bank’s discount rate was lowered from 10 to 9% percent on April 1,200 1 and to 8% percent on July 18,200 1. The unremunerated cash reserve requirement, which had remained unchanged since May 1999, was reduced from 6 to 5 percent on July 18,200l. 4 The indicative lending rate for a commercial bank is the average interest rate for its loans (weighted by loan amounts), excluding consumer loans, foreign currency loans, staff loans, and noninterest bearing loans, and was not to exceed 10 percent by August 1,200 1 and 9% percent by September 1,200l.

Low income taxation and tax exemptions support the offshore sector. The onshore sector also benefits from a range of exemptions which significantly reduce the effective marginal corporate tax rate, making it much closer to the rate for many offshore activities. Most offshore entities have parent companies in Canada or the United States. The regulation and supervision of onshore and offshore banks and insurance companies differ, but the authorities have taken initiatives to achieve convergence. Legislation to prevent money laundering is in place and a Financial Intelligence Unit, to which suspicious transactions must be reported, has been established.

Some may not be active. 3/ Since some entities are not active, the reported increase overstates the increase in active entities. The 52 active offshore banks mainly do business with nonresidents and had assets amounting to about 8% times GDP at end-2000. The number of active offshore banks has increased relatively slowly. A few offshore banks account for the bulk of total assets. Risks for depositors are contained by limiting third party deposits to adequately capitalized and well-managed local companies and subsidiaries of internationally reputable banks subject to home country supervision. Restrictions on dealing with residents are intended to reduce risk to the domestic economy. Offshore banks are supervised by the central bank, with the minister of finance issuing and revoking licenses based on its advice. The central bank conducts extensive investigations of applicants (fit and proper test) with the assistance of local and overseas supervisory and law enforcement authorities. Business plans are subject to fmancial analysis, including assessment of the net worth of the principal promoters.

The September 11 attack on the United States has had a significant impact on Barbados which depends heavily on tourism. While it is difficult to predict the duration of the effects, the prospects for 2001 and 2002 are for a decline in real GDP and deterioration in the fiscal and balance of payments accounts. 16. On October 29,2001, the government announced a 90-day national emergency program to minimize the impact of the September 11 attack. The program included: (i) reallocating total spending to utilize funds already budgeted to finance measures to assist the tourism, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors, and accelerate implementation of public investment projects to boost economic growth; (ii) further easing of monetary policy; (iii) reintroducing import licenses for selected agricultural products to protect domestic production; (iv) accelerating implementation of previously announced measures to assist the manufacturing sector; (v) easing conditions for small businesses to receive assistance; (vi) administrative and legislative measures to intensify efforts to combat money laundering, especially with regard to combating terrorism; and (vii) plans for external commercial borrowing by the government of US$150 million to build up international reserves for precautionary reasons. Before October 29, in response to the September 11 impact, salaries in the public enterprise for tourism development were cut, with broader wage reductions in the tourism sector as an option to protect employment and enhance external competitiveness. Negotiations for a civil service wage increase were suspended. The authorities have established an emergency economic council for closely monitoring developments. 17. According to preliminary staff projections taking into account the September 11 impact, real GDP is expected to decline by 2 percent in 2001. The overall deficit of the public sector could reach 2% percent of GDP and the external current account deficit, 6% percent of GDP. Assuming that the prospects for tourism continue to be bleak, a further deterioration in economic performance in 2002 as shown in the following table is likely: Real GDP External current account Public sector overall balance Central government overall balance Gross official reserves Before Sep. 11 2001 2002 (Annual percentage change) 1.0 2.3 (In percent of GDP) -5.0 -4.9 -0.9 0.1 -2.6 -1.7 (In months of imports of goods and services) 3.8 3.7 After Sen. 11 2001 2002 -2.1 -4.1 -6.3 -9.3 -2.7 -2.4 -3.9 -4.0 3.8 2.9 Sources: Barbadian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.

In the policy discussions which took place before September 11, the government stipulated that its economic objective is to achieve sustainable real economic growth of at least 3 percent annually to sustain improvements in Barbados’ standard of living, reduce poverty, and increase employment over the medium term. The strategy maintains tourism as the lead sector and intensifies the diversification effort towards development of agriculture, manufacturing, and information services. Central to this strategy is the need to maintain a high level of public savings over the medium term to help finance a PSIP supported by multilateral loans and focused on infrastructure, environmental protection, and education. The government also intends to continue the process of trade liberalization and other structural reforms, including privatization.5 Discussions focused on how to achieve these objectives by building on the sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms pursued to date. A. Fiscal Policy 19. The budget for fiscal year 2001/02 approved by parliament in March 2001 was projected to double the central government deficit to 3% percent of GDP. The main factors behind the larger deficit were higher wages,6 rising interest payments on external debt, increased capital expenditure, and an expected decline in income tax revenue owing to the slowdown. In the mission’s discussions, agreement was reached on the need to tighten fiscal policy. The minister of finance in a statement on economic and financial policies delivered to parliament in August 2001 announced measures broadly in line with this agreement that aimed at reducing the central government deficit to 2% percent of GDP (Box 2).7 5 Trade liberalization is driven by Barbados’ commitment to the WTO, CAFUCOM’s Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME), and the Free Trade Area of the Americas. 6 The wage bill included the payment in June 2001 of the last of three installments to compensate public sector workers for the salary cut in 199 1. In the early 199Os, as part of the adjustment program, wages of public sector workers were cut by 8 percent. The authorities promised to repay this cut over three fiscal years in equal installments of BDS$21 million. The first installment was paid in the first quarter of 2000 (fiscal year 1999/2000) and the second in the third quarter of 2000 (fiscal year 2000/O 1). 7 The August policy statement mentioned cabinet approval of an increase in the tariff from 40 percent to 60 percent on imports of manufactured products from outside the region, whose effective date of November 1 was announced in the national emergency program in October.

The Economic and Financial Policy Statement of August 8,200l On August 8,200 1, a statement on economic and financial policies of government was delivered to parliament setting forth the authorities’ policy agenda that underlies the central government budget for fiscal year 200 l/02. Warning that the country was entering a period of economic turbulence due to the slowdown and trade liberalization, the statement outlined measures “to restore Barbados to a sustainable path of development”. These include a range of incentives for sectors adversely affected by trade liberalization-in particular, agriculture and manufacturing-to encourage reforms that will enhance their competitiveness in an open trade environment. The government views these incentives as consistent with the protection allowed under Barbados’ regional and international trade agreements. Agricultural incentives include price support for cotton production along with technical assistance and incentives designed to enable the private sector to move into stages of production with higher value added, thereby enabling it to compete on its own in the market for more finished products. A development fund will provide targeted assistance more widely in agriculture to enable farmers to improve their post harvest and new crop technology, product differentiation, niche marketing, and export promotion. To complement technical assistance already provided to the manufacturing sector, the August 8 statement created a new industrial, investment and employment fund of BDS$25 million to finance the retooling of industries. With this I$nd, the government hopes to create at least 30 new industrial firms over the next few years. The statement included additional funding to market Barbados as a tourist destination. The statement presented measures to enhance the international competitiveness of the information services, which included a revised timetable for liberalization of the telecommunications sector. Reforms in other areas, including the financial sector, to meet Barbados’ obligations under CARICOM’s CSME were also outlined. The statement announced a reduction in the corporate tax rate by 2% percent in 2002, followed by further reductions over the next four years until it is 33 percent, down l?om the current 40 percent. It also initiated a review of tax incentives with a view to streamlining them. The statement revised the budget passed by parliament in March 200 1 in light of policies needed to address the global economic slowdown and trade liberalization. It presented a higher revenue estimate than the budget passed by parliament for fiscal year 2001/02, owing to projected collection of excise tax arrears. Higher revenue supported the additional current spending needed for the new funds created to finance the restructuring of agriculture and manufacturing, yielding current savings by the central government of 3.1 percent of GDP, below the 3.4 percent recommended by the mission. The statement proposed a reduction in domestically financed capital expenditure, bringing the overall deficit to 2.7 percent of GDP, close to the mission’s recommended 2.5 percent. 20. Over the medium term, the authorities’ aim is for government savings to rise to 5 percent of GDP and the overall public sector surplus to reach % percent of GDP in 2005. To achieve these targets, the authorities intend to constrain expenditure by cutting domestically financed capital spending and restraining government current spending. The central government wage bill is to be contained by means of a public sector wage strategy that links wage increases to productivity gains and targeted inflation. 21. The authorities saw the government’s ability to restrain the growth of subsidies and transfers, specifically those to public enterprises, as critical to reaching the fiscal targets. Toward that end, the authorities will urge public enterprises to adopt measures to reduce operating costs and move toward rate structures more closely linked to cost. In this way, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- room would be provided for targeted subsidies as needed. The mission recommended such a revision in the fare structure of the transport board, with discounts for certain groups covered by budget transfers calculated on the basis of their ridership. The water authority should continue to expand the use of meters to bill customers for actual use rather than apply only the minimum charge. The Fair Trading Commission needs to consider the adoption of rates to meet the cost of supplying water. In addition, attention should be given to adjusting sewerage fees, airport and seaport charges, rents charged by the housing authority, and fees for tertiary education. 22. In the discussions, the authorities described the broad outline of their approach to improving the efficiency of the corporate tax. A rationalization of tax concessions would permit the statutory tax rate to be lower, resulting in a reduced tax burden on a more uniform basis. The authorities viewed favorably the FAD technical assistance mission’s outline for domestic corporate tax reform, seeing it as consistent with their own desire to reduce the tax rate and rationalize an array of ad hoc tax incentives.* They supported FAD’s recommendations to: (i) replace the current system of capital allowances with a simpler one characterized by modestly accelerated depreciation; (ii) eliminate export allowances and foreign currency tax credits; and (iii) eliminate the approved enterprise scheme, while honoring existing commitments. They were not receptive to the proposed harmonization of the income tax rate for domestic and offshore businesses. They questioned FAD’s methodology for calculating a revenue-neutral harmonized rate and believed that the calculated rate implied an unacceptably large increase for the offshore sector that could discourage established and new entrants. B. Financial Policies 23. The mission felt that the central bank’s easing of monetary policy in 2001 was appropriate in light of the slowdown. The authorities argued that the introduction of an indicative lending rate was necessary to bring down lending rates because of limited competition in the banking industry owing to its oligopolistic structure. They further justified their action by pointing out that: (i) the indicative lending rate is an average lending rate and therefore has negligible impact on individual lending decisions; (ii) the stipulated spread was in line with the historical spread given the reduction in the unremunerated cash reserve requirement and minimum deposit rate; and (iii) by excluding consumer loans from the calculation, the interest burden was being shifted from productive sectors to loans financing private consumption. The mission recognized the indicative lending rate as a practical short- term measure, but noted that it could be perceived as a step back from liberalizing financial markets. The authorities did not share this concern. 8 Specific measures were presented in the August 8,200l policy statement (Box 2). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- 24. The authorities agreed that the appropriate solution to the failure of interest rates to decline is to increase competition by allowing freer movement of capital. The authorities stressed Barbados’ commitment to liberalize the capital account in the context of the CSME initiative.’ They plan to allow insurance companies and the NIS to increase their investment abroad subject to an agreement to repatriate these additional investments if the central bank has a need for international reserves.” The mission strongly supported the authorities’ intention to liberalize financial markets but cautioned that plans to allow additional investment abroad subject to a repatriation agreement could be perceived as contrary to the spirit of liberalization. The mission emphasized that capital account liberalization puts a premium on the continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to preserve market confidence. 25. The mission urged a more market-oriented approach to achieving monetary policy objectives based on lower unremunerated reserve requirements, more intensive use of open market operations, and the development of the secondary market for government securities. The authorities stated their intention to reduce cash reserve requirements gradually, as well as the statutory requirement to invest in government securities. The mission pointed out that the statutory requirement for banks to invest in government securities created a captive market for the government and lowered the interest rate of government securities. In effect, private sector borrowers are subsidizing public sector borrowing. However, the authorities noted that liquidity was high and felt that the possibility of diverting private sector borrowing toward the public sector was small. 26. The authorities described the ongoing effort to improve financial sector supervision so as to strengthen Barbados’ position as a reputable financial center. The central bank has increased the staff of the banking supervision department and encouraged banks to assess the risk of their loan portfolio with particular focus on loans collateralized by land and real estate. The mission encouraged amendments to legislation governing credit unions to facilitate effective supervision. The authorities intend to participate in the FSAP in time to have the results discussed at the 2002 Article IV consultation. 27. The mission discussed developments in the offshore sector. The increase in provisions on loans and investments could not be fully explained, except that it was appropriate given the global economic slowdown. The mission urged adoption of the new 9 CARICOM countries have agreed to the free movement of capital and labor under preconditions that include international reserves equivalent to at least three months of imports and external debt service not exceeding 15 percent of exports. lo The authorities considered including the NIS’ existing foreign assets in international reserves.

C. External Issues 28. The strength of Barbados’ balance of payments position over the next few years will be heavily dependent on tourism, as manufacturing exports face increasing competition owing to trade liberalization. Continued investment in tourism and export diversification are expected to reduce the current account deficit over the medium term. The rebound in tourism in 2000 was in response to increased investment. Although tourist arrivals dropped in the second quarter of 2001 reflecting the global economic slowdown, the decline was not as steep in Barbados as in the rest of the region. This was due to Barbados’ strong performance in the British tourism market in which its share increased in 2000. The mission discussed various measures of competitiveness, such as exchange rate and market share developments, which, taken together, indicate that Barbados is maintaining a competitive position in tourism (Box 3). Box 3. External Competitiveness The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) for Barbados has appreciated by 13.2 percent since 1990, owing mainly to the nominal depreciation of the Canadian dollar and the British sterling. The CPI-based REER can be viewed as a measure of factor cost competitiveness for Barbados, given its policy of linking wage increases to inflation and productivity gains. A market share analysis of tourism provides evidence that Barbados has maintained a competitive position in this sector during 1990-2000. In fact, Barbados has upheld a stable share of around 3 percent of total tourist arrivals to the Caribbean. Barbados’ performance in the main source countries, measured by its share in total outbound tourism to the region, varies. Barbados increased its share in the U.K. market fiom23.3 percent to 28.6 percent during 1993- 2000, but its share in the U.S. market fell from 1.9 to 1.1 percent during 1990-2000. Further, tourism price indicators indicate that Barbados’ competitiveness in tourism has not eroded, neither relative to its source countries nor its Caribbean competitors. Barbados has been encountering greater cost competition from countries outside the region. However, this did not result in a fall in market share in total outbound tourism of the source countries, indicating that the cost disadvantage of Barbados was offset by other nonprice factors. In contrast to tourism, Barbados’ competitiveness in the goods sector relative to its trading partners appears to have deteriorated, given a decline in Barbados’ export market shares. The loss in competitiveness in the goods sector is further supported by the appreciation of the GDP- and CPI -based REERs with its regional competitors. l1 The delay was caused by concerns about the definition of offshore banking, especially regarding its bearing on onshore banking. The purpose of this act is to ensure greater compliance with the core principles for effective banking supervision, in particular by facilitating on-site inspections of offshore banks and bringing their prudential regulation more in line with the regulation of onshore banks.

However, the authorities were exploring this market for possible re-entry in early 2002 to “warehouse” financing if it can be obtained at acceptable rates and maturities, implying further build-up of reserves.12 The mission noted that the authorities’ financial policies are projected to ensure an adequate level of international reserves without significant additional external commercial borrowing. The mission advised that any external borrowing focus on reducing the cost or extending the average maturity of existing public external debt (currently 8 years). 30. The authorities are addressing the challenges of trade liberalization by providing technical assistance and incentives for restructuring the tradable goods sector, with funding from privatization receipts. The mission cautioned against such support becoming subsidies that protect uncompetitive businesses. The authorities asserted that Barbados will avail itself of safeguard mechanisms to manage the decline of some industries, in particular manufacturing, and the rise of others, such as information processing, call centers, and software development. 31. The WTO bound tariff rates introduced in 2000 to replace nontariff barriers remain virtually unchanged at the high rates initially adopted. l3 The authorities indicated that the reduction of bound rates would be back loaded in order to give industries time to restructure. They emphasized that the government has informed industries of Barbados’ commitments to lower tariff rates so that they can adjust investment decisions in line with needed restructuring. The mission urged the authorities to bring bound rates down to WTO ceiling rates and to remove remaining nontariff barriers for agricultural and food processing activities, including the import monopoly of the Barbados Agricultural Development and Marketing Company, the state enterprise in nonsugar agriculture. D. Labor Market and Structural Issues 32. Given Barbados’ exchange rate regime, the mission emphasized improvement of the business environment by lowering the cost of doing business as essential for attracting new investment. The policy of wage restraint is a critical element of this strategy and, for this reason, the mission strongly supported adoption of the fourth protocol on social partnership linking wage increases to productivity gains and targeted inflation. The mission urged the government to reassess the proposed employment rights bill, which introduces lengthy, complicated procedures for laying off workers. The authorities assured the mission that parliament in its deliberations on the bill will not pass provisions that diminish flexibility in l2 As announced in October 2001, the government plans to borrow US$150 million. l3 The replacement of nontariff barriers by high bound tariff rates had the effect of raising Barbados’ index of trade restrictiveness from 5 to 6.

The mission encouraged the authorities to consider ways to reduce social insurance contributions for workers and employers by rationalizing the severance and unemployment benefit schemes. While acknowledging that both benefits can be received at the same time, the authorities argued that they serve different purposes and have been reduced in recent years. 33. The authorities discussed steps being considered toward pension reform. The tenth actuarial review of the NIS was described as corroborating the results of the ninth review which showed a sharp escalation of benefit expenditure and projected a deterioration of finances after 2005. Further, it included a supplement on reform options. . A study of the pension system for public sector workers had also been completed. The authorities are planning a public information program for October 2001 through March 2002 designed to promote public discussion of options (including changing the benefit base, establishing individual accounts, extending the working age, and diversifying investment of the reserve fund). The mission supported this consultative strategy and urged timely reform to ensure the long-term solvency of the pension system. 34. The authorities discussed Barbados’ situation as a high cost sugar exporter to the European Union in the face of a phased elimination of preferential access between July 2006 and July 2009. The government has adopted a plan to restructure the sugar industry that entails upgrading one factory and closing the other two less efficient factories. The authorities are addressing the phased removal of preferential treatment by cutting costs and producing specialty sugars in which Barbados can find a market niche. 35. The authorities plan a second public offering of shares in the BNB and ICB in early 2002. The mission welcomed this and encouraged privatization of other public enterprises in commercial activities outside the government’s core areas of responsibilities, such as port and airport services. E. Other Issues 36. The ministry of finance and the mission could only partially assess the finances of public enterprises because an adequate system of timely reporting and monitoring is not in place. The lack of information hampers policy making, including the pursuit of a suitable public external debt policy. The government needs to strengthen its monitoring of public enterprises with a view to improving their financial performance and debt management. 37. The mission inquired about Barbados’ need for technical assistance. The authorities broadly outlined interests in several areas, including tax administration, monetary policy, and statistical reporting, but deferred discussion of a detailed work plan to the development of a program for CARTAC.

The measures presented in the authorities’ August 2001 policy statement generated a medium-term outlook of 3 percent annual growth in real GDP, low inflation, and a leveling off of public external debt relative to GDP (Attachment IV). The government’s effort to increase public savings and accelerate public investment, along with plans to liberalize trade and telecommunication, lower domestic tax rates, and restructure industry, would contribute to growth. Continued restraint on wages and fiscal restraint would be critical to maintaining Barbados’ external competitiveness and achieving debt sustainability over the medium term. 39. The September 11 attack has a significant negative impact on the medium-term outlook, mainly through its effect on tourism. To attempt to quantify the effect, a scenario was constructed based on a 25 percent reduction in tourism in the latter part of 2001 through 2002 (Table 9),14 In 2002 real GDP is projected to decline by 4 percent and the external current account deficit to widen significantly. International reserves would decline below the equivalent of three months of imports of goods and services in 2002. The overall deficit of the central government is projected at 4 percent in 2002, with some downside risk owing to uncertainty about the impact of the output decline on revenue collections. Over the medium term, as tourism recovers, real GDP growth would resume and achieve its targeted growth rate of 3 percent in 2005. Fiscal balances would improve and the external current account deficit narrow by end-2005 to its level before September 11,200l. VI. STAFF APPRAISAL 40. The authorities achieved eight consecutive years of noninflationary growth through 2000 based on sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies, wage restraint, public investment, and structural reforms designed to enhance Barbados’ external competitiveness under the fixed exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar. This has reduced unemployment and raised income levels significantly. Barbados has maintained a niche in the high-end of the tourism market, which is the mainstay of the economy. Tourism was declining and real GDP growth was projected to slow down before the September 11 attack on the U.S. In the aftermath, tourist arrivals dropped sharply and a recession is expected in 2001-02. The measures taken by the authorities constitute a broadly appropriate response to the impact of the September 11 attack. The staff supports the authorities’ stance to sustain prudent fiscal policy, pursue a tight wage policy, and ease monetary policy. 41. The medium-term strategy presented in the August 2001 policy statement seeks to continue fiscal discipline by improving efficiency in public sector operations and l4 In October 2001 the authorities projected about the same reduction in 2001, but a lower decline of 16 percent in 2002. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- enhancing public sector savings to provide resources for the public sector investment program, which comprises projects in the government’s core areas of responsibility- education, health, infrastructure, and environmental protection. The medium-term strategy supports tourism and also promotes diversification into businesses in which Barbados can compete externally. The staff urges restraint in the government’s current spending by reducing transfers to public enterprises and limiting spending on goods and services. Reductions in transfers to public enterprises should follow from trimming their operating costs and linking their rate structures more closely to cost. 42. The staff endorses the strategy of linking wage increases to productivity gains and targeted inflation in public and private sector wage settlements. The social partnership needs to seek ways to enhance labor market flexibility to support Barbados’ adjustment to trade liberalization. 43. The staff is concerned that the introduction of an indicative lending rate for addressing limited competition in the banking industry may appear inconsistent with the authorities’ commitment to financial market liberalization. The staff urges redesign of reserve requirements and development of the secondary market for government securities to achieve a more market-oriented approach to monetary policy. This should contribute to lowering interest rates, promoting competition in the banking industry, and moving toward financial market liberalization. 44. The authorities have taken steps to ease capital restrictions by allowing additional investment abroad subject to a repatriation agreement. Rather than require such restrictions to minimize risk, the staff encourages the authorities to continue to pursue capital account liberalization in the context of sound macroeconomic policies and strong financial sector regulation and supervision 45. The staff supports the government’s efforts to restructure the tradable goods sector using privatization receipts and new incentives for agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. It would be important that these incentives not provide permanent subsidies for uncompetitive businesses. The staff strongly advises that the reintroduction of import licenses and tariff increases announced in the national emergency program be limited to 90 days as it interrupts the steady movement toward trade liberalization. The same risk is posed by the back-loading of tariff reductions to allow time for inefficient industries to restructure. The staff urges the authorities to reduce bound tariff rates and eliminate remaining nontariff barriers. 46. The medium-term outlook indicates that if appropriate macroeconomic and fiscal policies are implemented, Barbados will not have a need for additional substantial external commercial borrowing by the government either to build international reserves or to meet public sector financing requirements. In any event, the staff advises that any external commercial borrowing be limited and used for reducing the cost or extending the maturity of existing public external debt.

The authorities deserve credit for their ongoing effort to strengthen the financial sector, both onshore and offshore, by improving its regulation and supervision. To that end, the new international banking act should be adopted. The staff encourages legislation to strengthen supervision of credit unions. The authorities’ intention to participate in the FSAP in time for the 2002 Article IV consultation discussions is welcome. 48. The staff strongly urges the authorities to implement in a timely manner the reforms needed to ensure the continued solvency of the pension system and to streamline the system of tax incentives. The authorities should consider privatization of public enterprises engaged in commercial activities. 49. Although economic and financial statistics are available on a timely basis, reporting on the finances of public enterprises needs to be improved. In addition, data on the accounts of offshore banks and external debt, including government guaranteed debt to finance public enterprises, could be improved to enhance surveillance of economic developments and policies. 50. The staff recommends that Barbados remain on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - Table 1.

Information about Barbados macroeconomic statistics (metadata) and the authorities’ plans for improving the statistical base are posted on the Internet on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. 1. Real sector Compilation of the national accounts by economic sector is hampered by lack of reliable and current data on nonsugar agriculture, private construction and nontourism service activities. The national accounts by expenditure suffer from weaknesses in the external trade and private investment data. Figures for gross domestic product at constant prices are based on 1974 price weights, but the authorities are in the process of updating the weights to 1994. Quarterly GDP estimates are no longer provided. In addition, the consumer price index uses 1978 expenditure weights which also should be updated to a more recent period. 2. Nonfinancial public sector Fairly comprehensive and up-to-date data above the line are available for the general government, but there is a lag in the reporting of transfers. As a result of net errors and omissions in the recording of financial transactions, a significant discrepancy exists between the overall balance and financing data. Data on public enterprises are not systematically and promptly reported to the ministry of finance. Also, financial sector data on public sector net domestic borrowing usually cannot fully be reconciled with above the line fiscal data, partly because of limited availability of the nonbank financial sector information. Data supplied by the public enterprises, such as on government transfers and capital spending, often differ from those provided by the ministry of finance. 3. Financial sector Important weaknesses remain with respect to the overall quality, coverage, and timeliness of the monetary accounts. The concept of residency applied to the monetary statistics is not consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) classifies some loans to and deposits of nonresidents as credit to the private sector and part of broad money, respectively, instead of as net foreign assets of commercial banks. Moreover, non-national individuals are recognized as residents only after they have resided continuously in Barbados for at least three years. There is also a need to extend the coverage of data to include offshore bank accounts. Recently, the timeliness of data reported to STA for publication in IFS greatly improved. The lag in submitting monetary data decreased from about five months to about three weeks for the central bank accounts, and about six weeks for the monetary survey. Accounting conventions underlying monetary data compiled by the CBB are in need of improvement. The CBB data are reported on a cash basis and do not include accrued receivables and payables. Commercial banks’ positions are recorded on an accrual basis; however, the accrued interest receivable and payable is Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicATTACHMENT V - 36 - classified under other assets and other liabilities, respectively, rather than under the appropriate category of domestic credit. Marketable securities are recorded at the acquisition cost and revalued to market value only on an annual basis (as of December 3 1). Short-term zero-coupon securities (treasury bills) are recorded at acquisition cost and are not revalued to market value until redemption at maturity. Positions with the IMF (SDR holdings, Reserve Tranche Position, and SDR Allocation) are valued at the IMF holdings rate rather than at the end-of-period market rate. These issues are being addressed in the context of the general framework of the GDDS. 4. External sector Lags in the compilation of merchandise trade data limit the timeliness of estimating the external current account balance. Estimates of the components of the investment account also need to be strengthened. Quarterly balance of payments estimates are no longer provided.

Background Barbados has achieved eight consecutive years of noninflationary growth through 2000 based on broad public consensus on macroeconomic policies, including a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar since 1975 and wage restraint. These policies have helped preserve Barbados’ external competitiveness, reduce unemployment, and raise income levels. Barbados continues to have the highest United Nations human development index in the Caribbean region and a poverty rate of less than 20 percent. In 2000 a strong rebound in tourism and sugar output contributed to an estimated real GDP growth of 3 percent, up from 2% percent in 1999 when the closing of some hotels for refurbishing led to a decline in tourism (Table 1). Growth continued in the first quarter of 200 1, but preliminary estimates indicate that real GDP declined in the second quarter owing to the slowdown in the United States, Canada, and Europe, which adversely affected tourism. The rate of economic growth was projected to decline to 1 percent in 2001 before the events of September 11,200 1. The unemployment rate rose to 10 percent at end-June 2001 from 9% percent at end-2000. Inflation rose from 3 percent at end-1999 to 3% percent at end-2000, mainly due to increases in petroleum and food prices, and is projected to moderate to 2% percent during 2001. Barbados’ real effective exchange rate appreciated by 6 percent during 2000 and 2 percent through July 2001, mainly due to appreciation of the U.S. dollar. The overall balance of the consolidated public sector shifted from a surplus of % percent of GDP in fiscal year 1999/2000 to a small deficit in 2000/01 (fiscal year is April-March). This reflected an increase in the central government deficit from 1% percent of GDP in fiscal year 1999/2000 to 1% percent of GDP in 2000/01, mainly attributable to higher spending on goods and services, transfers, and capital projects. The deficit was covered mainly by long- term project finance. The National Insurance Scheme (NIS) surplus grew owing to employment growth and higher investment income. Domestic debt of the nonfinancial public sector declined from 23% percent of GDP at end-l 999 to 20% percent of GDP at end-2000, helped by some repayment of banking system debt. Public external debt increased from 19 percent at end-1999 to 23 percent of GDP at end-2000, broadly offsetting the decline in domestic debt and leaving total public debt about level at 43 percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicATTACHMENT VI - 39 - After increasing in the three previous years, the external current account deficit declined in 2000 to 5 percent of GDP from 6 percent in 1999, as strong import of consumer goods and capital goods for investment in tourism facilities subsided and tourism grew with the completion of these facilities. Long-term project finance and private capital inflows covered the current account deficit. Although import growth continues to be sluggish, the deficit is expected to remain 5 percent of GDP in 200 1, reflecting the effect of the slowdown on tourism, higher interest payments for public external debt, and a projected decline in exports of sugar and manufactured goods. The government’s external commercial borrowing in June 2000 contributed to raising the central bank’s net foreign assets to the equivalent of four months of imports of goods and services. This increase represented a precautionary build-up of international reserves to address balance of payments pressures that may arise as a consequence of trade liberalization or unexpected external developments. Broad money expanded by 8 percent in 2000, reflecting the build-up in international reserves. As evidence of an economic slowdown became more pronounced, the central bank eased monetary policy. Despite this easing, domestic lending rates did not decrease and credit to the private sector grew only by a modest 2% percent. In response, the central bank introduced an indicative lending rate in July 2001 as a practical short-term measure for addressing limited competition in the banking industry. The authorities continue to strengthen the financial sector, both onshore and offshore, by improving its regulation and supervision. The authorities’ economic objectives are to achieve a quick recovery from the economic slowdown that began in the first half of 2001 and was accelerated by the September 11 attack on the U.S. in a manner that sustains growth and employment over the medium term. Their strategy is to provide the stimulus for a recovery and maintain an overall surplus over the medium term in the finances of the nonfinancial public sector, while carrying out a public sector investment program financed by multilateral loans and focused on infrastructure, environmental protection, education, and tourism. Their strategy also aims at restructuring the economy to meet the challenges of trade liberalization and other structural reforms, including privatization. The authorities’ main objectives over the medium term are to maintain low inflation and achieve a real economic growth rate of 3 percent annually to sustain improvements in Barbados’ standard of living and reduce poverty.
