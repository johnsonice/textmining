The staff team comprised MessrUMmes. Tseng (Head), Robinson, Krelove, Husain, Duenwald (all APD), Richardson (FAD), Dorsey (PDR) and Laurens (MAE), and was assisted by Mr. Hcytcns (Deputy Resident Representative). Mr. Wei (Executive Director) participated in the last week of discussions, and Mr. Sugisaki joined the team during May 15-18 for its foal meetings. Mr. Fischer visited China during June 20-21, 1999. . The team met with People’s Bank of China (PBC) Governor Dai Xianglong; PBC Deputy Governor Liu Mingkang; Vice Minister of Finance Lou Jiwei; Vice Governor of Yunnan Province Cheng Ying Xuan; senior officials from other government ministries and agencies; and members of the academic, banking and business communities. . At the 1998 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors noted that China had continued to weather the Asian crisis better than most other countries in the region. However, with growth slowing and the balance of economic risks on the downside, Directors agreed that there was scope for a temporary relaxation of fiscal policy. Given China’s relatively strong external position, Directors strongly supported the authorities’ commitment to maintain the stability of the renminbi, although-given ongoing structural reform-they believed a more flexible policy would be required over the longer term. The key challenge remained to accelerate implementation of structural reforms, particularly of the banks and public enterprises, accompanied by a strengthening of the revenue-to-GDP ratio to ensure fiscal sustainability can be maintained. They also underscored the need to improve statistics. . Just following the Article IV mission, a staff team visited Beijing to assess the jurisdictional implications of the intensified enforcement of exchange and capital control regulations under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The mission’s conclusions will be set out in a supplement to be issued before the Executive Board meeting. . The principal authors of the staff report were Messrs. Robinson and Krelove. ‘The term “country” as used in this paper does not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice; the term also covers some territofial entities that are not states, but for which statistical data are maintained and provided internationally on a separate and independent basis.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY . . China has continued to weather the Asian crisis relatively well, aided by skillful macroeconomic management, a relatively strong external position, and-to some extent-the protection provided by capital controls. However, weak private demand, rising unemployment, and high capital outflows remain serious problems. In addition, the weak financial position of banks and state enterprises-and the associated problem of long-run fiscal sustainability-give rise to significant risks. The authorities have appropriately eased fiscal policy to boost demand, and have taken a series of measures to encourage the private sector. With downside risks to growth, a further modest fiscal stimulus-presently under preparation-would provide helpful support to demand later in the year. The policy of maintaining the stability of the renminbi remains appropriate, given China’s relatively strong external position; however, the recent sharp reduction in interest rates has opened up a wide differential with U.S. dollar rates; the impact on the capital account will need to be closely monitored, and contingency plans developed. With China likely to experience continued rapid structural change, greater exchange rate flexibility will be needed in the future. As the authorities well recognize, reform of banks and enterprises remains the central economic challenge. Since late 1997, financial sector reform has been significantly accelerated, culminating in the recent decision to set up asset management companies (AMCs) for each state commercial bank. This will need to be accompanied by the development of a strong credit culture, further strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework, and measures to address problems in smaller financial institutions. The success of financial sector reform continues to depend critically on reform of the state enterprises. Over the coming year, it will be critical that the AMCs play a strong role in enterprise restructuring, supported by greater reliance on bankruptcies (as the authorities intend). Continued efforts to strengthen the social safety net will also be essential. Given the substantial costs of structural reforms, urgent attention must be given to strengthening fiscal sustainability, especially through raising the revenue/GDP ratio. This will need to be supported by reform of intergovernmental relations. To counter widespread evasion, the authorities significantly intensified enforcement - of China’s exchange controls. While this appears to have had some success in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- curtailing illegal activities, additional efforts are needed to limit the impact on legitimate transactions. . China’s economic statistics continue to suffer from significant deficiencies in many areas, seriously hampering surveillance, and further improvement remains a central priority. 11. BACKGROUND 1. Over the past two decades, China’s economic performance has been impressive. The policies of “opening up” and market-oriented reform have resulted in rapid GDP growth, a dramatic reduction in poverty, and sizable total factor productivity (TFP) growth (Chart 1). Since 1993, however, TFP growth has slowed, and GDP growth has been increasingly accounted for by high investment. The financial performance of the state owned enterprises (SOEs) has also deteriorated (Box l), accompanied by excess capacity and high stock building. With SOE losses financed primarily by state commercial banks (SCBs), non- performing loans rose and the SCBs’ financial position deteriorated. Consequently, the linked issues of banking and SOE reform have become a top priority. 2. Following the investment-led boom of the early 199Os, a “soft landing” was successfully achieved by 1996. Thereafter, macroeconomic developments remained initially favorable, aided by strong external demand (Table 1 and Chart 2). However, with the onset of the Asian crisis, the external environment deteriorated. From early 1998, exports began to decline in U.S. dollar terms (Box 2 and Chart 3), and foreign direct investment flattened off. Despite several cuts in interest rates, domestic demand growth was sluggish, as households postponed consumption in the face of uncertainties arising from SOE reforms (including higher unemployment2 and increasing costs of housing, health, and education); slower rural income growth and weak nonstate investment also contributed. As a result, GDP growth slowed to 7 percent by mid-l 998. The combination of weakening demand, excess capacity, and falling export and import prices, also led to deflationary pressures. 3. In response to the growing impact of the Asian crisis, the authorities moved quickly to boost domestic demand. In mid-1998, a fiscal stimulus package amounting to about 2% percent of GDP was announced, focused on infrastructural (and to a lesser extent) social safety net spending, particularly in the poor central and western regions of China. In addition, the authorities have taken the lessons of the Asian crisis to heart in acting to reduce financial risks and vulnerabilities, notably through the acceleration of financial sector reform While data on unemployment are weak, the unemployment rate has risen since the mid- 1990s as layoffs from SOEs accelerated (Box 3). _ Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- Chart 1 CHINA: GDP GROWTH AND TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY, 1978-98 (In pcrccnt) 7s 79 80 *I 82 83 84 BJ 86 87 B* 89 90 91 92 93 94 91 96 97 98 CONTruLuJnON OF FACTOR INPUTS TO GROWM Laba 18 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 81 88 89 5% 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 16 II I* IO 8 6 4 * * 6 4 2 0 12 TOTAL FACTOl r- @onhhLticn to gmti, 10 h A *I /\ /\ -I8 Source: Staff estimates.

China: State Enterprise Reform State enterprise reform has occupied a central place in the authorities’ policy agenda since the 15th Party Congress in September 1997, when President Jiang called for an expansion and acceleration of the reform experiments already underway (see below). ‘Ihe subsequent ascension of Zhu Ron&i as Premier in March 1998 marked the beginning of a three-year program to restore China’s larger SOEs to health. During the National People’s Congress this past March, it was announced that the final two years of the program would be focussed on improving the performance of a select group of 7,680 large and medium-sized SOEs, and in particular on reducing the proportion of loss-making enterprises within this group from one-third in 1998 lo 15 percent by end-2000. The financial performance of China’s 250,000 SOEs, which employ an estimated 70 million workers (some 35 percent of the urban labor force), nevertheless continued to deteriorate over the past year (Table 5). As in the past, poor performance was caused by a variety of macroeconomic and industry-specific factors, which were exacerbated by slowing growth and disastrous sumner floods. Most manufactured and industrial product sectors continued to be plagued by excess capacity, which prompted increasingly intense price competition among enterprises to maintain market share. Other problems included weak management, over staffing, high debt, outdated products and technologies, an excessive social welfare burden, and high relative tax rates. Against this background, the broad strategy of state enterprise reform has been guided by the principle of “seize the large and release the small,” concentrated along hvo tracks: . Reform of large enterprises has been undertaken through a variety of pilot programs, ccntered on industrial consolidation through acqmsmons and the creation of large enterprise groups; intioducing greater autonomy and improved corporate governance through the separation of enterprises from government ministries and the introduction of modem management statures; and diversifying ownership, primarily through issuance of stock on exchanges. . Small enterprise reform has been left to the provincial and local governments, who are removing them from state ownership through sales to management, workers or outside investors, among other methods. Progress continued to be made in SOE reform during 1998, despite concerns about social unrest . An estimated six million workers were laid off from state enterprises (nearly 10 percent of SOE employment), a significant increase over previous years, prompting the authorities to accelerate efforts to establish a social safety net. . Sectoral restructuring programs were launched to reduce excess capacity in industries suffering the largest losses. In the textile sector, 5.12 million spindles (11 percent of the total) were idled while 660,000 workers (17 percent) were laid off, reducing losses by Y 2.6 billion during 1998; in the coal sector, 15,000 small and inefficient mines have been shut since November, with a view to reducing output by 25 percent. . The volume of debt writeoff rose to Y 40 billion (l/2 percent of GDP), a Y 10 billion increase over 1997. In contrast with previous years, virtually all of the debt write off in 1998 was focussed on large enterprises; in total, nearly 1,900 SOEs were merged, acquired, or put into bankruptcy proceedings under the debt write-offprogram. . Steps were initiated to break up monopolies in the petroleum and telecommunications sectors, leading to increased competition and lower domestic prices for crude oil and mobile telephone services. . Activity to move small enterprises out of the state sector accelerated in the wake ofthe 15th Pam Congress. By end-1998, the more progressive coastal and southern provinces had “released” most of their smaller SOEs, while many northeastern “rust bek” provinces had also made significant progress in _ disposing of small enterprises.

China: The Export Slowdown Following the onset of the Asian financial crisis, China’s export growth fell sharply to % percen in 1998, from 21 percent in 1997.Seasonsl adjustments to the monthly data indicate that there was a steady decline in the dollar value of exports during the course of the year, followed by a pickup in Early 1999 (Chart 3). The export decline is character&d by the following: Market Sbre in MaJor Export Markets (Imports from China in percent of total imports) ’ The decline in export growth was due mainly to weaker external demand. 1995 1996 1997 1998 IWSQI 1999Ql According to the latest WEO, imports U.S. 6.3 6.7 1.3 8.0 3.2 3.3 of goods by China’s trading partners EU 1.7 1.8 2.0 2.1 fell by 2 percent in real terms in 1998, Japan 10.7 11.6 12.4 13.0 8.7 9.2 compared with an increase of 6-8 Asia-5’ 3.8 3.9 4.7 4.8 3.8 4.5 percent in 1996-97. 3 &PO ma&S tn”Puc% Chma cu.mms stapdlrs; Exports to the Asian region fell “GA &ne:%&i~,m. sharply in 199% exports to the United Quutnly o@rcs, which UC Lud on aids upon da% M 001 compambls 10 a@nyPl og”res.

However, the effect on profit margins was partly offset by lower import prices, which fell by 2 percent overall and by 9 percent for ordinary imports.

While some foreign trading companies @‘KS) are encountering financial difticuitiet mainly those that have invested heavily in real estate--others appear to be performing well The FTCs have tended to increasingly focus on shipping in recent years, and their marketing role has diminished. Moreover, the number of companies with trading rights has risen considerably, even before the granting of direct trading rights to a large number of manufacturers in early 1999. While exports have contracted on a year-on-year basis in the first five months of 1999, the seasonally adjusted pattern suggests a modest recovery relative to the last quarter of 1998 (Chart 3). Nevertheless, notwithstanding the projected recovery in external demand, the staffexpects fhe dollar value of exports to decline by 1% percent for the year as a whole.

Unemployed xiagang were estimated to total unarplo-t me 5.9 6.7 6.9 million workers at the end of 1997,’ leading to a broad unemployment rate of around 6 percent. It is estimated that an additional 6 million workers were laid off from the SOEs in 1998, but centers were cstablishcd to speed up reemployment (see below). The authorities estimate that about 8.9 milbon x~~gaog remained unemployed in 1998, leadmg to an overall unemployment rate of 6.7 percent. However, other observers, including the World Bank, estimate that the unemployment rate could be I%2 percentage points higher. Since layoffs are a relatively recent phenomenon in the Chinese economy, the social security system has been partial and incomplete. To improve the social safety net for the xiagang, a three-phase system is being implemented: l Income supparr and reemploymenl ofxiagang: reemployment centers are being set up to aid the transition to new jobs. Laid off workers are eligible for income suppoli based on prevailing wages in the region. The program is financed by local governments, local uncmploymcnt insurance funds, and the SOEs. In addition, the central government has increased transfers to localities that have been hit hardest by unemployment to help them meet their contributions to the reemployment centers. . Unemploymenr insurance: Xiagang who have not found employment after three years must now sever their relation with thor reemployment center lmplymg the loss inter aha of nonwage benefits prowded by the employer, and can jom the registered unemployed pool and become eligible for unemployment insurance payments (which are lower than payments in the reemployment centcrs) for a period of two years. Jo addition, the unemployment insurance system is being expanded to cover almost all urban workers (up from about 60 percent coverage), and contribution mtes have been incrcascd. Since the funds are pooled only locally, in some high unemployment areas beneficiaries receive partial or no payments because of a lack of funds. . Mnimum incomeprogram: After unemployment insurance eligibility expires the worker can collect amimmum bving stipend, under programs that were inboduced beginning 1994 to deal with poverty. Currently most cities have introduced such programs, and they will be introduced in all county-level aties by the end of 1999. The programs are locally tinanccd, and in some cities stipends are low or not paid altogether because of fiscal constraints. While these changes wdl go some way in easing the transition to employment for the laid off, payments remain low in many cases, coverage is incomplete, there remain some disincentives to take new jobs quickly, and insufficient risk pooling means that regional disparities in ability to finance the programs remain. Because unemployment is largely P structural problem, further efforts we needed to improve tbe structure of the social safety net for tbe unemployed and its financing. High unemployment will persist into the medium term for a number of reasons: (i) there is a large surplus labor pool in the SOEs, banks, and government, and the process of reallocatmg this labor will take a number of years; (ii) there is a large surplus rural labor pool (more than 130 million, according to estlmatcs) that will need to be absorbed into nonagriculture (both rural and urban) employment; and (iii) labor market rigidities (e.g., legal restraints on mobility, imperfect housing markets, and education and health insurance provided by employers) restrict the ahihty of wages to perform their allocatlve role and slow the rate at which released labor can be reabsorbed. ‘In the statisttcs reported by the Chinese authorities, the levels of registered unemployment and labor force are not consistent wth the reported registered unemployment rate. ‘Since the mission, the authorities have reportedly revised their estimate of xmgang unemployed at end-1997 to _ I I .5 million which would wose the unemployment rate to 8 percent in 1997, implying a declme in the unemployment rate in 1998. The staff is presently seeking further informatmn on the reasons for the revisions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13- since late 1997. Notably, the closure and eventual bankruptcy of the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Company (GITIC) served to reduce moral hazard (Box 4). 4. As a result of the fiscal stimulus-about two-thirds of which was disbursed in 1998-GDP growth accelerated sharply in the second half of the year. Thus, even though private sector demand remained subdued, stockbuilding fell (partly reflecting restructuring of sectors with excess capacity and hardening budget constraints), and China experienced the worst flooding in many years, GDP growth reached 7% percent for the year, very close to the authorities’ 8 percent target.’ However, with deflationary pressures emergingdue to the combination of excess capacity, weakening demand, and falling grain prices-inflation was negative for the year (-0.8 percent).4 Based on official data, unemployment is estimated at nearly 7 percent, although other observers-including the World Bank-estimate that the rate could be l%-2 percentage points higher (Box 3). 5. The current account surplus declined marginally to 3% percent of GDP in 1998, still very high by historical standards (Table 2). A slight improvement in the trade account in U.S. dollar termsdue mainly to a decline in imports of investment goods by foreign funded enterprises, and of primary products, including oil-was offset by higher outward tourism and interest payments. However, while foreign direct investment inflows remained strong (partly due to the approval of a number of major projects early in the year), the capital account deteriorated sharply, and negative errors and omissions remained high. Thus, the overall balance of payments surplus fell sharply from $36 billion in 1997 to $6 billion in 1998; reserves increased to $150 billion (11 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services and 256 percent of short-term external liabilities). 6. The deterioration in the capital account between 1996 and 1998 remains difficult to explain fully, given the lack of consistent balance of payments and debt data. The key factors in 1998 included (i) a sharp increase in net outflows of trade credit, reflecting ‘GDP data in China have a number of deficiencies (Annex I), and many analysts, including the World Bank, have suggested that they systematically overestimate growth by 1-2 percent annually. Some analysts--citing the weakness in electricity production and freight traffic-have suggested that this discrepancy increased in 1998. The weakness in electricity production and freight traffic partly reflects specific factors-such as higher electricity prices, and falling coal production (which accounts for a substantial part of freight traffic). Nevertheless, while the data provide an important indicator of broad trends, they have to be interpreted cautiously. “Econometric work by the staff suggests that external factors-including falling tradeable prices, and fhe diversion of export goods to domestic markets-have also played an . important role (see “Price Formation in China: Examining the Causes of Deflation,” in the Selected Issues paper, forthcoming).

China: GITIC Bankruptcy and its Effects Following its closure by the PBC in October 1998 for failing tu meet its debt obligations, the Gunngdong International Trust and Investment Corporation (GITIC) was declared bankrupt in January. GlTIC’s liabilities, around one half of which had not been registered, amounted to $4.4 billion--mostly in foreign exchange to external creditors-while its assets were valued at $2.6 billion. It was announced that individual depositors, whose principal claims amounted to $0. I billion, would be repaid immediately by the provincial government.’ In April 1999, decisions of Chinese courts and new financial information released through creditors meetings resulted in a downward revision of GlTIC’s assets and implied that creditors can expect the recovery of at must I7 percent of their claims. On April 23, 1999 the liquidation committee announced that there was no possibility that GITIC will be restructured. The closure ui GITIC without P bailout of must creditors sends a stroag signal to markets that lhe Chinese nutborlties do not implicitly guarantee all external obligations of Chinese entities, and that markets should base lending decisions on credit risk analysis rather than personal connections or an assumed sovereign guarantee. As a result, problems of unproductive invcshnent financed in an environment of moral hazard should be reduced in the medium and longer term The GITIC case bar led tu increased uncertainty among investors PS they perceive it tu Involve a deja&o change in the authorities’ implicit guarantee of external obligations.’ Creditors have complained of a lack of transpnrcucy in the liquidation proceedings thus far; in response, the authorities have hired foreign legal and nccountiug advisors to assist in the liquidation process. While repayment priorities for CITE’s obligations have nut yet been announced, Chinese law accords the highest priority to employees, followed by government taxes, and then creditors. This is China’s largest bankruptcy since 1949 and there is no legal precedent for such proceedings involving foreign creditors. Several other ITICs and Hong Kong SAR window companies of nwr EitCrnsl Lhbililkl mainland enterprises have also encountered financial difficulties in (I” billions ofdollars, recent months. The PBC has announced that the trust and investment (TIC) sector will be restructured through mergers, consolidation, and WTK 0 ,hCI mcs ntar closures. It may be noted, however, that the TICS together account for Tdal 3.7 19.6 23.3 only around 5 percent of the total assets of the financial system, and only D&l 1.9 15.8 17.7 around 20 ITlCs (out of a total of 239) have borrowed from abroad. Total Registaed 5.8 registered ITIC external debt is about $8 billion; including unregistered Unreginncd’ 10.0 external claims, the staff estimates that the ITICs’ cxtcmal obligations Cmlngent liabilities 1.8 3.8 5.6 could be about $18 billion, with an additional $6 billion in external Rcgistncd 1.4 contingent liabilities. Unrcgirrerd 2.4 The GITIC bankruptcy and the difficulties in the ITIC sector have ‘Estimated baasd an Hong Kong SAR banks’ prompted markets tu increasingly differentiate between sovereign mio afunre*islcrcd 111 regiStered clamr. and nonsovereign entities in China. This has been reflected in wider differentiation in ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies in recent months tu obligations of the government, state commercial banks, and the ITlCs (Chart 4). There have also been reports at P credit squeeze for mainland enterprises, including those registered in Hong Koag SAR. While the financially strongest enterprises have continued to have access to credit, an orderly withdrawal of credit from mainland and mainland-related firms as a whole has been reported, with the Hong Kong SAR banking system’s total exposure tu such firms declining by 8% percent in the last quarter of 1998. Several mainland firms have postponed initial public offerings in Hong Kong SAR, and at least one enterprise has abandoned plans of an uvcrscas bond issue in favor of domestic bonds. Moreover, several local government-owned enterprises in Guangdong province have reportedly missed domestic debt payments, raising questions about the extent to which local and provincial governments stand behind their obligations. ‘Although the ITlCs arc prohibited from accepting deposits. GITIC had around 25,000 individual depositors at the time of its bankruptcy. ’ For their pat, the authorities have issued several statements in rcccnt years warning investors that unauthorized external borrowings would nut be guaranteed by the central government. + Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - ‘Table 2.

The remainder includes approximately $10 billion in reclassified outflows originally recorded as trade credits, the nature of which is not fully clear. Illegal or misrecorded outflows-likely to be captured primarily under trade credit and errors and omissions-became an increasing problem from late 1997, driven by concerns of a devaluation of the remninbi, the falling differential between domestic and foreign interest rates, and rising smuggling. 7. In response to these developments, the authorities significantly intensified enforcement of exchange and capital controls,s and moved forcefully to reduce smuggling. These measures have reduced illegal activities, although there are widespread reports that legal transactions have also been adversely affected (Section 1V.E). Thus, since late 1998, reserves have risen, despite a weakening trade balance, falling foreign direct investment, and the impact of the closure of the GITIC (which, while desirable from the perspective of reducing moral hazard, had the short-term effect of causing investors to reassess China risk). 8. The state budget deficit increased by 1% percent of GDP to 3 percent of GDP in 1998 (Table 3 and Chart 4). The revenue ratio rose by % percent of GDP, the third successive annual increase; about one-third of this growth was due to enhanced collection of arrears. This was offset by additional expenditures relating to the fiscal stimulus program, as well as for defense and public administration. It should be noted that the state budget excludes the social and extra budgetary funds, as well as quasi-fiscal lending through the banking system. While limited data are available, the staffs calculations suggest that the broad-based deficit-the state budget deficit plus estimated quasi-fiscal lending6--could be over 7 percent of GDP. 9. Broad money (M2) growth slowed to 15% percent in 1998, slightly below the authorities’ 16-18 percent target (Table 4). While bank lending behavior has become generally more cautious to contain credit risk, credit growth picked up in the second half as ‘The main measures included intensified enforcement of documentation requirements for all authorized transactions; and new and reinforced measures to control capital account transactions. “The quasi-fiscal deficit in the banking system is defined conceptually as the sum of the nonrecoverable portion of new nonperforming loans (NRNPLs), plus interest on the outstanding stock of NRNPLs. Since data on these are not available, it is assumed for _ illustrative purposes that the stock of NRNPLs is 20 percent of credit outstanding, and the flow is 20 percent of new credits extended (see Box 8).

External Vulnerability An assessment of China’s external debt vubterabiity, adjusting for discrepancies with BIS data, suggests that the situation remains msnageabk, given China’s high external reserves and continued current account surplus. The staff has divided China’s external liabilities into three categories . The lowest risk category (30 percent of the stock at md-1998) is government and government-guaranteed debt, primarily larding from official creditors to the govemment E&g of relatively long maturity, and having a clear claim on ofGal reserves (and accounting for only 113 of those rexwes) it appears relatively safe from both creditor and borrowa perspectives. . The moderate risk category (41 percent at ad-1998) comprises registered debt of foreign funded enterprises, joint venture enterpriws, and state commercial banks (SCBs). There is an implicit potential external guaraotor (the foreign parent or partner for the entapriss and the Chinese government for the SCBs), but clearly potential risk (for example, SCB ratings have been below the sowreign ratings for a whiltChart 6). . The higher risk ntegory(28 percent at end-1998) covers debt without any implicit guarantee and debt not registered with the Chbxac authorities. Unregistered debt, which appears ovewhelmingly short term, includes liabilities not requiring registration, (e.g., a& credits). as well as liabilities that should be registered but aren’t. Liabilities of state commercial banks and oonbnnk financial institutions have beol nearly flat In recent years. Most of the growth in recorded external liabilities ha come in tbe debt of foreign-funded and foreign joint wnture entexpises and, until 1998, unregistered debt. The share of moderate risk debt increased steadily between 1994 and 1998, offset through 1996 by 8 decline in the share of low risk borrowing, and in 1997-98, by a reversal of higher risk tlows from BIS commercial bank creditors. While the risk structure of this debt continues to embody substantial vulnerability, this should be set against the large increase in the current accoont surplus and in international reseves over that period (Table 7).

As inflation turned negative, and U.S. interest rates eased, deposit interest rates were lowered by an average 1.2 percentage points during 1998. A further reduction, averaging 1 percentage point, took place in June 1999; the benchmark one-year deposit rate was reduced to 2% percent, approxi- mately 3% percentage points below corresponding rates on U.S. dollar deposits abroad. In March 1998, reserve requirements were reduced by 5 percentage points to 8 percent, and excess reserve requirements were abolished, with the liquidity impact offset by a reduction in PBC credit to SCBs; greater flexibility in interest rates for lending to small enterprises was also introduced. 10. Despite episodes of pressure-particularly in July and August, 1998~the renminbi was kept stable against the U.S. dollar. Following the Asian crisis, the real effective exchange rate initially appreciated (Chart 5), prompting several measures to boost exports, including increasing VAT rebates (to a range of 9-17 percent for nonagricultural products, compared with a VAT rate of 17 percent), allowing more enterprises direct trading rights, and providing subsidized credits to exporters. The real appreciation has since been reversed as the currencies of the crisis countries and the yen strengthened, and domestic prices fell; by end-April 1999, the real effective exchange rate had returned to its June 1997 level. 11. On the structural side, solid progress was made in reforms of the financial and SOE sectors. In the financial sector, the PBC branch network was restructured along the lines of the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase its operational independence from provincial governments; the SCBs were partially recapitalized and given greater independence; the credit plan was abolished; work to improve the regulatory and supervisory framework was begun, including a pilot project to introduce improved classification standards (although these remain below international standards-Annex III); and a number of insolvent financial institutions were closed (with domestic depositors compensated). While SOE profitability declined (Table 5), ties with government agencies and the military were largely severed; restructuring of sectors with excess capacity accelerated; and the social safety net was strengthened. 12. In 1999, negotiations on China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) intensified. While discussions still continue, China has offered major market- opening measures, including substantial cuts in tariffs on agricultural and industrial products; reductions in quantitative restrictions; allowing foreign companies greater freedom to import, export and distribute their products in China; and liberalizing foreign investment in the services sector, including telecommunications and financial services. 13. Developments in the asset markets were mixed (Chart 6). The “A” share markets-limited to domestic residents-remained relatively unaffected by the Asian crisis, despite the worsening performance of listed companies. However, the “B” share markets, limited to foreigners--dropped by some 80 percent through early 1999, due to the deterioration in external sentiment, as well as growing illiquidity.

In the property market, real estate investment accelerated during 1998 and early 1999, again partly reflecting the fiscal stimulus package; however, substantial excess supply of retail and office space persists in a number of major cities. III. OUTLOOKANDRISKS 14. For 1999, GDP growth will initially continue to be boosted by the fiscal stimulus, but the effects will steadily decline during the year. Thus, while GDP growth in the first quarter of 1999 has remained high (8.3 percent), it is estimated to have slowed to about 7 percent in the second quarter, and is expected to average 6% percent for the year as a whole (Table 6), with the growth rate slowing significantly in the latter half. Allowing for a further 7 million new layoffs fiorn SOEs, as the authorities plan, urban unemployment would likely rise further (depending on the success of retraining and reemployment measures). The CPI is expected to decline by 1% percent, with a pickup in import prices more than offset by the continued impact of excess capacity, weak domestic demand, and structural reforms. 15. On the external side, the current account surplus is projected to decline by 2% percent of GDP to 1 percent of GDP, largely accounted by a fall in the trade surplus. Although exports are expected to pick up modestly during the year as external demand improves, they are projected to decline by 1% percent for the year as a whole (reflecting the carryover effect from the previous year). At the same time, import growth is expected to rise significantly, mainly due to the anti-smuggling campaign (through a substitution of recorded for unrecorded imports, which has already been evident from late 1998). 16. Projections of the external capital account remain subject to great uncertainty. Inflows of foreign direct investment are projected to decline sharply in 1999, as the full effects of the Asian crisis are felt; and net portfolio flows are projected to remain weak. Lending to nonsovereign borrowers, which had already turned substantially negative in 1998, is expected to show continued-albeit reduced--outflows.’ Finally, the recent reduction in interest rates is expected to result in some increase in outflows in the second half of the year. Overall, the capital account deficit is expected to remain broadly unchanged; however, even allowing for some reduction in errors and omissions (the counterpart of the reduction in unrecorded imports), the overall external position would show a small deficit, implying a deterioration in the second half of the year. This projection is, however, subject to wide margins of error, and close monitoring of capital account developments will be needed. ‘This mainly reflects a less marked decline in net trade credits, as the shortening of trade credit maturities available to Chinese importers (and lengthening of trade credits offered by Chinese exporters) slows and illegal outflows are constrained by intensified enforcement of controls.

The medium-term outlook is centered on two key assumptions: an improving external environment in line with World Economic Outlook projections, and an acceleration of the pace of structural reform. The latter will adversely affect output in the shortrun as inefficient industries are closed down (although the quality of GDP growth is likely to improve). Thus, GDP growth would slow below 6 percent through 2001, rising to above 7 percent by 2004 as the productivity gains from reform begin to be felt. This would be unlikely, however, to be sufficient to absorb the combination of new entrants to the labor force, additional laid off workers, and new rural migrants, implying that urban unemploy- ment will remain a serious problem. The current account position is expected to shift gradually into modest deficit, with a pickup in exports as external demand strengthens offset by buoyant import growth driven by rising domestic demand and continued trade liberaliza- tion. With some further strengthening of the capital account as external confidence improves, the balance of payments would revert to modest surplus. 18. There are, however, a number of risks to the outlook. In the short run, if private and external demand are weaker than projected, GDP growth could slow more than the staff projects toward the end of the year. The balance of payments could also come under pressure if exports slow further or the capital account weakens. On the structural side, the problems in banks and SOEs are-as the authorities recognize-very serious. Without steady progress with reforms, nonperforming loans would continue to rise, and the financial position of the banking system would deteriorate further, resulting in rising quasi-fiscal liabilities, steadily weakening growth and rising macroeconomic risks. Rising unemployment could also lead to strains on social stability. 19. Analysis of macroeconomic risks and vulnerabilities in China is significantly hampered by the weak statistical base. Poor transparency, weak accounting practices, an underdeveloped legal system, and corruption also increase the possibility of adverse surprises and of contagion effects. The authorities are well aware of these issues, and are working vigorously to address them. In the interim, however, given the large margin of error in assessing risk and vulnerabilities, the design and implementation of policies affecting areas of particular uncertainty needs to be especially prudent. IV. POLICYDISCUSSIONS 20. The authorities stated that, as the Asian financial crisis had deepened, the impact on China had been greater than initially expected. With exports slowing, and domestic demand also remaining sluggish, a proactive fiscal policy had therefore been adopted from mid-1998, with the aims of supporting growth, ensuring social stability, and helping address regional inequalities. During 1999, the external environment was expected to remain difficult, and therefore macroeconomic policies would need to continue to be supportive of domestic demand, underpinned by measures to boost exports, encourage the - private sector, and strengthen rural consumption. At the same time, the stability of the renminbi would be maintained. On the structural side, the authorities believed that the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - coming two years would be crucial for China’s financial system and for SOE reforms. With the key vulnerabilities well understood, reforms in both areas would be further accelerated over the coming year, supported by a strengthened social safety net. Reforms were made even more necessary by China’s prospective entry into the WTO. 21. The staff broadly supported the authorities’ position, in particular welcoming their commitment to accelerate structural reforms, which was essential to support growth and maintain macroeconomic stability. It noted, however, that balancing the various objectives would involve difficult policy choices during the year. In particular, as noted above, the acceleration of structural reform would adversely affect growth and employment in the short run. At the same time, macroeconomic policy options to support growth were constrained by the commitment to exchange rate stability and by longer-run fiscal sustainability concerns. Thus, the discussions focused on how best to manage these potential conflicts and risks. A. Exchange Rate Policy and External Vulnerability 22. The authorities reconfirmed their commitment to maintaining the stability of the renminbi during the remainder of 1999. For 1999, they believed that China’s strong economic fundamentals provided a solid foundation for maintaining the exchange rate. They anticipated only modest pressure on capital flows as a result of the huge differential between domestic and U.S. interest rates and the GITIC collapse, which would anyway be manageable given the high level of reserves. Even so, capital flows would be carefully monitored and policies-including if necessary capital controls-adjusted appropriately. 23. The staff agreed that stability of the renminbi remained in the best interest of both China and the region at the present time. While slowing export growth was a concern-and some exporters had been hit hard by declining export prices-China’s export shares had continued to hold up in major export markets. Thus, it appeared that weak external demand, rather than inadequate competitiveness, had been the main reason for the export slowdown. However, with China likely to experience continued rapid structural change, greater exchange rate flexibility would be required in the future, once the regional situation stabilized (Box 6). The authorities broadly agreed, noting that over the medium-term market forces would have to be the major determinant of the exchange rate. 24. China’s external vulnerability remains manageable (Chart 7). As of end-1998, external debt (official definition), stood at $146 billion, of which $17 billion was short term.

While the pattern of declining correlations is evident in most bilateral correlations of regional currencies Ind stock markets amongst one another, several cross-market correlations have increased in the last hree months, suggesting that regional factorsincluding improved market sentiment toward the ,egion-have played an important role in the recent rise in Asian stock markets. In some cases, the present eve1 of the cross-correlation is higher than at any time during 1997-98 (e.g. the correlations behveen China’s xmency and stock market values with those of the Philippines and Indonesia). Moreover, the correlation ,etwcen renminbi NDFs and Hong Kong SAR (measured against Hong Kong interbank interest rates since the Song Kong dollar is fixed under the linked exchange rate system), though declining somewhat, remains relatively high. The decline in most regional cross-market correlations, together with the improvement in regional narkct sentiment, appears to suggest that the prospect of contagion effects from China have weakened in ‘ecent months. While it is possible that a large shock could lead to renewed contagion, it is noteworthy that leither the fmancial situation in Brazil nor the GITIC bankruptcy led to a significant rise in cross-market :orrelations in the region in early 1999.

The authorities stated that reserves were invested in high quality and liquid assets, with no transactions involving commercial loans; and that reserve management was fully in line with international practices. However, they declined to provide any specific information on reserve composition or management. B. Short-Run Macroeconomic Management 25. The authorities noted that China’s economy had remained resilient and relatively stable despite the deteriorating external situation, aided by a timely fiscal stimulus in mid-1998. However, despite the impact of the stimulus-and of earlier interest rate cuts-private demand remained sluggish and deflationary pressures persisted, reflecting a combination of excess supply, weak demand, and continued good harvests. The difficulty in stimulating private demand in part reflected the fact that private consumption was presently depressed by precautionary savings, and nonstate investment was constrained more by the availability of credit, rather than its price. Thus, the authorities had taken a series of additional measures to boost consumption (including raising rural incomes through higher procurement prices for grain, developing rural infrastructure, and strengthening the social safety net), and to strengthen the private sector (Section 1V.C and Box 7). Over the medium term, housing reform was also expected to have an important impact. 26. With activity remaining strong in the first quarter, the authorities believed that GDP growth of 7 percent for the year as a whole was within reach. They stressed that robust GDP growth was very important for China, especially given the pressures in the labor market; nevertheless, it was not a mandatory target, and a modest shortfall would not be a cause for concern. The most important factor was the quality of growth, and not its quantity. The staff agreed, noting that it was important to avoid unduly ambitious growth targets that could only be achieved at the expense of economic efficiency or the needed economic reforms. *China’s external debt data suffer from a number of deficiencies, including incomplete coverage of borrowing from commercial banks, the absence of data on a remaining maturity basis; and gaps and long lags in the publication and provision of data. 9However, there may be other potential obligations, including liabilities of subsidiaries of Chinese firms outside Mainland China (significant in the case of the GITIC), and direct _ investments with guaranteed minimum rates of return.

Supporting the Development of China’s Private Sector The nonstate sector, which has grown rapidly, played a key role in China’s rapid productivity growth during the reform period.’ . Between 1980 and 1997, the share of the state sector in industrial output fell from 76 percent to 25 percent, while, correspondingly, that of the nonstate sector rose to 75 percent. In addition, within the nonstate sector, the share of “other” (i.e., private) enterprises in industrial output rose dramatically to almost match that of the collectives. Most of the growth in collectives took place in the 198Os, whereas the private sector expanded most rapidly in the 1990s. . Similarly, the state sector’s share in industrial employment has fallen to under 30 percent, while the nonstate sector’s share has risen correspondingly. It is noteworthy that the private sector’s share in employment has more than doubled since 1985, accounting for 3 1 percent of industrial employment in 1997. This has been accompanied by a corresponding fall in the share of the collectives sector. The partial figures available for 1998 suggest that this trend may have continued, with employment in private firms and self-employment rising 21 percent over 1997.

I other 0.0 14.4 19.7 30.6 In the past, the Chinese leadership viewed private enterprises as peripheral, resulting in significant constraints on private sector expansion. Thus, relative to collectively owned and state-owned enterprises, private enterprises’ property rights were less secure; access to credit from the state banks was very limited, forcing private firms to use retained earnings, informal financial markets, and family and friends as sources of capital; and they were often subject to arbitrary fees and charges. The Chinese authorities have recently sought to expand the role of the private sector in the economy, realizing the sector’s potential to absorb the rapidly rising unemployed. The most recent measwes include: . amending the constitution to elevate the statlls of fhe private sector to an %nportant component” instead of only a “complement” to the socialist economy, and to promote the rule of law in China; . increasing the private sector’s access lo bank lending, including by issuing guidelines to the state commercial banks to extend a certain portion of their lending to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs-many of which are private), by expanding credit guarantees for SMEs, and by the PBC making additional credit available to fanners; . reducing the arbitrary fees and charges on private business, including via the anti-cormption campaign; and . increasing the number of private companies allowed to conduct foreign trade. Nevertheless, much remains to he done to support the further expansion of the private sector. Critical measures include: . increasing private fums’ (both urban and rural) access to capital (via bank lending, domestic and overseas stock market listing, and leasing); and . removing sectoral entry barriers (especially in telecommunications and financial services). ’ In China, the nonstate sector consists of the collective enterprises (including the township and village enterprises) and “other” enterprises. The latter category, which the staff treat as a rough approximation of the private sector, is composed of individual-owed enterprises and other enterprises (including mainly foreign-funded enterprises, domestic joint ventures, and privately-owned enterprises). There are some problems associated with measuring the size of the private sector in China, including the fact that some collectives are actually private firms, and that some joint “enfores are state-owned.

For 1999, the state budget deficit is estimated to increase by % percent of GDP to 3% percent of GDP, due to additional expenditures to complete infrastructure projects begun in 1998; social safety net-related subsidies to local governments; higher defense expenditures (to offset the loss of off-budget revenues from enterprises formerly owned by the military); and-to a lesser extent-higher export tax rebates. The revenue ratio is projected to increase by % percent of GDP (excluding exceptional collection of arrears in 1998). The authorities report that revenues have increased by 25 percent in the first five months of 1999, while expenditures increased 17 percent. While the staff has no breakdown of the data, it under- stands the revenue increase is due to the anti-smuggling drive, improved enforcement, and higher stamp tax receipts from the recent pickup in the stock market. While an assessment of these developments will need to await further data, were they to continue, the budget deficit would be lower than projected. The authorities expected the increase in the deficit to be temporary, and that the overall deficit would decline in 2000 (although the earlier target of primary balance would be hard to achieve). 28. Given the continued weakness of demand, the staff supported the budgeted increase in tbe fiscal deficit. However, it expressed concern at reports of implementation problems relating to the infrastructural program, including corruption and shoddy construc- tion. The authorities said that rapid start up of some projects had resulted in some problems, but that quality was in general acceptable. A supervisory task force had been established to audit project quality, and if problems emerged, government loan disbursements could be suspended for all projects in that province.‘In addition, a responsibility system with administrative and legal penalties was introduced to ensure project quality. 29. The authorities stated that monetary policy would be supportive of economic growth. To this end, M2 growth is targeted at 14-I 5 percent, implying a somewhat more rapid decline in velocity than trend; in the first part of the year, monetary growth has been somewhat higher, reflecting the continued rapid growth in household savings. Domestic credit is projected to increase by 17 percent, with banks encouraged to lend to small and medium-sized enterprises; agriculture and the rural economy; exports; infrastructure; and consumer credit, including mortgages. The authorities stated that these guidelines were indicative, and that banks were not subject to pressure to lend to noncommercial projects. 30. The staff observed that, as noted above, there were potential downside risks to GDP growth in the second half of the year. If growth were to slow substantially below the level projected by the staff, additional macroeconomic stimulus would need to be considered. A further reduction in interest rates might have only a limited impact on demand, and would add to risks on the capital account. Therefore, the staff suggested that any further stimulus should focus primarily on the fiscal side (despite the need to strengthen the medium-term fiscal position). With the World Bank now assessing that the pipeline of efficient infiastruc- tural projects is limited, this should be focused on additional social safety net expenditures (which would facilitate structural reform), and possibly further increases in VAT rebate rates (up to a maximum of zero rating). The authorities were broadly in agreement, but believed Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 35 - that they had more scope on the monetary side than the staff suggested; while external considerations were a constraint, the recent intensified enforcement of capital controls had given them room for maneuver. 31. Following the mission, the latest data suggest that activity has weakened further, and deflationary pressures intensified. Against that background, in early June, the authorities cut interest rates sharply (paragraph 9). They have also indicated that they are preparing a further fiscal stimulus package (possibly of the order of 1 percent of GDP), comprising additional infrastructural and social safety net expenditures. Given the weakening outlook for demand, and stronger-than-expected revenue developments, the staff is supportive of further fiscal stimulus, which could provide helpful support to demand in late 1999 and early 2000. Given the concerns about additional infiastructural expenditures already noted, the staff would encourage the authorities to focus the package on strengthening the social safety net. It remains concerned, however, that the interest rate cut will add to pressures on the capital account and further test capital controls; the authorities will need to develop contingency plans for such an event. C. Accelerating Structural Reform Financial Sector Reform 32. Over the past five years, financial sector reform has followed a phased approach, beginning with the establishment of policy banks to relieve SCBs from policy lending in 1994, and followed by efforts to commercialize SCBs and make them responsible for the quality of their lending. From late 1997, in light of the lessons from the Asian crisis, reforms were significantly accelerated in several areas (paragraph 11). While significant progress has been made, the financial sector continues to face serious structural problems, and-although the staff does not have sufficient data to make a full assessment-its financial position is generally believed to be very weak.“’ 33. During 1999, the focus of fmancial reforms will shift to setting up asset AMCs for each SCB, thereby relieving them of the bulk of their remaining NPLs (the AMC for the China Construction Bank has already been established). The AMCs will buy NPLs with some prospect of recovery at book value in exchange for bonds, and then seek to maximize recovery through a variety of means, including direct sale, a debt-equity swap, negotiation of an orderly restructuring with debtors, and bankruptcy. To prevent new bad loans emerging, “‘The authorities have in the past stated that NPLs (using the old classification system) are in the range of 20-25 percent; market analysts’ estimates are in the range of 20-40 percent. A recent pilot project in Guangdong, using the new classification system which is closer to international standards, found NPLs of 40 percent (the equivalent level under the old system is not available). -,., - .,,..., -., Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - SCBs will sign “governance contracts” setting out key performance goals; new risk management and monitoring procedures are also being established, along with supervisory boards to oversee the performance of top managers. The authorities are also considering further improvements to the classification and provisioning system, including reducing the classification period for overdue loans from one year to six months (and ultimately three months); raising the general provision from 1 percent to 1% percent; and introducing specific provisioning.” The staff urged that these proposals be promptly implemented. 34. While the staff welcomed these measures, it stressed that additional actions would be needed to ensure that they were fully effective. It highlighted four key areas: Rapidly clarify the remaining operational modalities of the AMCs, including how they would be financed (the staff urged that this be done transparently through the budget). It would thus be crucial to ensure that AMCs are used to the full to promote enterprise restructuring, and clarifying how best to provide credit to enterprises undergoing restructuring. Move forward rapidly in developing a credit culture, including further strengthening bank independence; further commercialization of bank operations (including ensuring that subsidies to loss-making enterprises were provided transparently through the budget or policy banks); retraining of commercial bank staff; and improving legal and accounting standards, including the bankruptcy law (which remains unduly biased against creditors).i* Strengthen banking supervision, including through continued efforts to train supervisors, improving the reporting system for off site monitoring, and prioritizing on site supervision. Make a full assessment of the financial condition of banks using international provisioning and classification standards, to determine the size of the problem faced. The fmancial position of the nationwide and regional banks, and the extent to which they also require restructuring, should be given particular attention. The authorities broadly agreed, although they placed less emphasis on further assessment of the fmancial position of banks than on improving bank management and governance, which they saw as the most serious problem. “Under the present system, general provisioning is restricted to 1 percent of outstanding loans; there are no specific provisions. ‘?See “The Bankruptcy Law in China,” in the Selected Issues paper, forthcoming.

The staff noted that enhancing competition in the banking system could make an important contribution to improving the credit culture. While the SCBs would inevitably retain a dominant role in the short run, there was room to expand the role of foreign banks and allow entry of new private banks (consistent with the development of banking supervision capacity). Once the SCBs had been rehabilitated, consideration could be given to breaking them up into smaller banks, in which foreign or domestic investors could purchase shares. The authorities said that an extension of the role of foreign banks was under consideration in the WTO negotiations; diversification of ownership of SCBs would be considered once the Ah4Cs had been set up, and NPLs transferred, but majority state ownership would be maintained. 36. Over the past year, a number of rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) have experienced difficulties, including in some cases runs on deposits. The authorities noted that these problems stemmed horn high NPLs and administrative costs; there had also been contagion effects from the closure of illegal financial institutions. To address these problems, the authorities are considering introducing a limited deposit insurance scheme for RCCs.” The staff expressed concern that, given the weak financial position of RCCs, a deposit insurance scheme might not be financially viable; moreover, since it would offer only limited coverage, it might encourage depositors to shit? funds to institutions where there is believed to be a fall implicit guarantee (such as SCBs). It therefore recommended that the scheme be postponed until the financial position of the RCCs had been strengthened through an appropriate restructuring program, and supervisory capacity enhanced (the Asian Development Bank has provided assistance in these areas). The authorities noted these concerns, and indicated that they would proceed cautiously. 37. Financial difficulties have also emerged in a number of International Trust and Investment Companies (ITICs), exemplified by the closure and eventual bankruptcy of the Guangdong ITIC. The authorities expect shortly to announce a consolidation and restructuring plan for all trust and investment companies-primarily through mergers and acquisitions-including limiting their activities strictly to asset management, and preventing them from borrowing abroad. The staff welcomed these plans which will need to be supported by strengthened supervision, and it also supported the decision to put the GITIC into bankruptcy in order to limit future moral hazard. However, despite the recent appoint- ment of foreign legal and accounting firms to advise in the GITIC liquidation process, it noted that creditors were still expressing concern about a lack of transparency and creditor consultation during the liquidation proceedings, and urged that efforts in these areas be strengthened. It also advised the authorities to further enhance collection of data on ITIC external debt to include the liabilities of offshore subsidiaries. ‘While individual RCCs are generally very small, they account in total for about 20 percept of household deposits.

Since 1994, the reform of the SOEs has been conducted under the guiding principle of “seize the large, release the small.” During 1998, reform of medium and large enterprises focused on improving corporate governance, including through breaking links between the government, the military, and the enterprise management; restructuring sectors with excess capacity, especially the textiles and coal sectors; and breaking up monopolies, including in the petroleum and telecommunications sector, to foster competition. However, partly due to the Asian crisis, the profitability of SOEs deteriorated further in 1998 (although-partly due to the anti-smuggling campaign-profitability improved from the latter part of the year). 39. Ownership diversification of small enterprises, which is the responsibility of local government, has accelerated signiticantly in recent years. The authorities noted, however, that in early 1998 this had resulted in growing abuses (including direct sales to enterprise managers at very low prices, illegal loan write-offs, and forced sales to workers). Thus, they had issued regulations seeking to curb such abuses, and encourage other methods of ownership transfer, such as conversion to joint stock companies and leasing. While no data were available, the authorities believed that the pace of disposal of small enterprises nevertheless remained rapid. 40. For 1999, the authorities stated that enterprise reform would be accelerated, despite concerns over unemployment. In particular, there would be greater emphasis on bankruptcy-with no annual limit on debt write-offs’4-and sectoral restructuring would be accelerated. The staff welcomed this, but underscored that it would be essential that sufficient fiscal resources were made available to finance it; it also suggested accelerating ownership transfer of large enterprises through direct sales of shares to private investors, including foreigners. The authorities said that this was being considered as part of a further major package of SOE reform measures expected to be announced in the fall. 41. With unemployment likely to remain a pressing issue, strengthening the social safety net remains a key objective. To this end, the authorities noted that a three-tier social security system had been set up (Box 3), financed by local governments, social insurance funds, and the SOEs; central government had also increased transfers to local governments who were unable to pay their share of the costs. In addition, during 1998 some 3 million workers had been retrained and about 50 percent of laid off SOE workers had been reemployed. The staff welcomed this progress, but noted that further fiscal resources might be needed to finance the social safety net in particularly hard hit regions. There was also scope to increase interregional pooling of unemployment and pension funds. r4Previously, bankruptcies have been constrained by an annual limit on debt write-offs ~ (Y 40 billion in 1998).

The authorities are seeking to expand the role of the nonstate sector, given its dynamic performance in recent years and its potential to create employment. In March 1999, the National People’s Congress passed constitutional amendments to elevate the role of the private sector in the economy, and to promote the rule of law; measures have also been taken to improve access to bank credit (including through guarantee schemes); reduce arbitrary fees and charges; and permit more private companies to conduct foreign trade. The staff noted that it would be important to ensure that guarantee schemes were designed to minimize the risk of contingent fiscal liabilities. Consideration could also be given to allowing more private firms to list on the stock exchange; further strengthening private property rights; and reducing restrictions on private sector activities (e.g., in the construction sector). 43. Strengthening China’s capital markets, which are relatively small and underdeveloped, remains a key policy aim. In late 1998, the NPC approved the long awaited Securities Law, which includes unified supervision of securities markets; a two-tier ranking system for securities companies; greater transparency in listing and issuance procedures, and in data provision by listed companies; and tougher penalties on illegal trading.15 In June 1999, the authorities moved to strengthen the “El” share markets by reducing stamp tax from 0.4 percent to 0.3 percent, and allowing collectives and other firms to issue “B” market shares, opening the door for the private sector to tap the markets on a wider scale. D. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability 44. While China’s state budget deficit and debt are relatively modest by international standards, the fiscal position is much weaker when account is taken of quasi-fiscal activities in the banking system. In addition, in coming years there will be a need for additional expenditures for social sector reforms, infrastructure, and the environment (assessed at up to 5 percent of GDP annually by the World Bank); there are also substantial accrued pension liabilities-f some 50 percent of GDP-which may fall partly or fully on the government. An illustrative medium-term scenario suggests that, without underlying fiscal or quasi-fiscal adjustment, government debt (including quasi-fiscal liabilities) could rise to 95 percent of GDP within a decade, and interest expenses could increase to over 80 percent of central government revenue (Box 8 and Table 8). This would be clearly unsustainable. 45. The staff therefore underscored the urgency of measures to strengthen the fiscal position over the medium term. A key element, of course, would be successfit financial ‘See “The Development of China’s Stock Market,” Selected Issues paper, forthcoming. ,., -- .,.. ,..-, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - Box 8. Medium-Term Fiscal Sustainability in China’ Both the authorities and the staff believe that ensuring fiscal sustainability is critical to underpin macroeconomic stability and growth over the medium term. Although the underlying data are subject to vely significant uncertainties, two key concerns appear to merit special consideration: 1. The accumulated stock, and the new flow, of nonperforming and nonrecoverable (quasi-fiscal) lending by the banking system, particularly to the SOE sector. While little data is available, in these calculations we assume that about 30 percent of bank lending is nonperforming, and, in line with rates elsewhere in the region, that only about % of that is recoverable. 2. The likely magnitude of extra fiscal spending priorities for which China will need to make budgetary provisions over the medium term. The budget will need to accommodate a number of additional spending pressures over the coming decade, including for physical infrastructure (roads, housing, environment, water conservancy) and social infrastructure (extending coverage and funding of the education, health, pension and unemployment systems).2’ Although IBRD estimates suggest that the amount needed could eventually rise to as much as 5 percent of GDP, we have conservatively assumed an increase of 3 percent of GDP, phased in smoothly over the period. The fiscal sustainability scenarios in Table 8 share a common set of macroeconomic assumptions: the real growth rate falls to 5.5 percent in 2001, and gradually rises by 2006 to 7% percent, where it stays constant, while the real interest rate goes to 6 percent in 2000, where it stays constant as well. The real growth rate of credit falls smoothly from around 8 percent in 2000-01 to 2 percent in 2004, and stays at that level thereafter To illustrate the possible impact of each of the two key factors above, a pair of scenarios are presented in Table 8. The baseline scenario illustrates the outlook with no policy adjushnent (either of the state budget or of quasi fiscal activities). In that case, with new quasi-fiscal lending continuing at assumed current levels, and new spending needs coming on line as well, China’s debt stock almost doubles OXT ten years. The share of central govemment revenue which needs lo be devoted to the interest on this debt rises fourfold. The alternative scenario illushates the broad scale of fiscal adjustment needed to contain the debt to GDP ratio at around 65 percent. This involves a smooth reduction in the flow of new nonrecoverable loans (from 20 percent of all banking system lending to the economy to 2% percent by 2008), as well as a fiscal adjustment of about 4 percent of GDP. These scenarios are obviously illustrative in nature, and are subject to considerable uncertainties arising in the underlying data and the policy response to the problem. For instance, if the initial size of the bad loan problem was 40 percent rather than 20 percent of bank lending, then the fiscal adjustment above causes the debt stock to stabilize at around 83 percent of GDP, with debt service occupying 60-65 percent of central government TCYC”“C. ‘The work on fiscal sustainability in this report builds on previous joint work with the World Bank *Chino 2020: Development Challenges in the New Century, World Bank (1997), p.26 ‘The projections include an element lo cover the carrying cost of the implicit pension debt, but not a formal conversion lo government debt.

However, even if new quasi-fiscal spending by banks was largely eliminated within a decade, significant additional fiscal adjustment would be needed to stabilize the debt/GDP ratio at around 65 percent of GDP (alternative scenario, Table 8). While this adjustment could partly be achieved through expenditure reductions, a substantial strengthening of the revenue ratio would be necessary. The staff recommended a further strengthening of tax administration (especially monitoring, enforcement and auditing, which may also require increased manpower); a reduction or elimination of income tax preferences; broadening the VAT base (and ultimately extending it to services); increasing the business and excise taxes (including on fuel and tobacco); and introducing a property tax. 46. While the authorities believed that the pressures on the fiscal position were likely to be lower than projected by the staff, they agreed that the revenue ratio should be strengthened. In this context, the progress over the past three years had been encouraging, and would be continued, driven by improved collection and enforcement procedures and new policy measures (including some mentioned by the staff). In addition, they planned to convert about 8 percent of GDP of fees charged by extrabudgetary funds into taxes and bring them onto the budget. The staff agreed that this had merit from the perspectives of equity and efficiency; however, it would not substantially improve the underlying fiscal situation unless the expenditures that the fees presently finance could also be reduced.16 47. The staff observed that fiscal strains were exacerbated by the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations. As the medium-term scenario shows, the costs of bank and enterprise reforms will fall disproportionately on the central government whose revenue share is very low. In addition, the limited fiscal transfers between provinces (and lack of pooling of unemployment and pension funds) have led to serious difficulties in poorer provinces with high concentrations of loss-making SOEs. Finally, revenue reforms themselves will affect revenue distribution-and therefore transfers-between central and provincial governments. Thus, a fundamental reassessment of intergovernment fiscal relations was needed to assure fiscal sustainability over the medium term. The authorities recognized the problems in the present system, and noted that recent efforts to convert many local road fees into a centralized fuel tax had been designed to improve flexibility and reduce vulnerability at the central level. E. Trade and Capital Account Issues 48. While China has made progress in liberalizing its trade regime in recent years, tariffs remain high and substantial nontariff barriers persist, including import quotas ‘6However, if the revenue accrued to the central government, and was not earmarked to specific expenditures, this would help to reduce the central government interest service ratio and thereby fiscal sustainability (see paragraph 47).

The staff welcomed the recent progress in WTO negotiations, noting China’s accession would result in significant liberalization which would be supportive of reforms, bolster domestic competition, and ultimately yield substantial productivity gains. The authorities agreed, although they noted that in the short term a number of sectors would face significant pressures, underscoring the importance of moving forward rapidly with structural reforms. While the trade surplus would likely fall in the short run, they expected this to be offset by rising foreign investment inflows. 49. China’s capital account remains relatively closed, with most transactions subject to government approval (Annex II). While capital controls have not been a panacea-and have clearly been leaky-in China’s particular circumstances they have helped reduce external vulnerability. In particular, limitations on foreign borrowing have helped ensure that external debt remains manageable in an environment where most banks and corporates are state owned (so that moral hazard is a major potential problem) and prudential regulations and supervision are in need of strengthening. Also, because it is difficult for nonresidents to take positions against the renminbi, China has been to some degree insulated from contagion effects. The authorities indicated that while capital account liberalization was still their long- term objective, it would need to be carefully sequenced with reforms in other areas (particularly the financial sector). 50. The authorities stated that the recent intensification of enforcement of exchange controls bad been necessary in view of widespread evidence of smuggling and illegal capital outflows. While they acknowledged that there had been some negative effect on legitimate transactions, they believed this was transitory; indeed, following the introduction of a computer link between the customs administration and the exchange control authorities, the time needed to complete many import payments had been greatly reduced. (Many firms had also benefited from reduced competition from smuggled goods as a result of the anti- smuggling campaign.) To improve transparency and efficiency, new regulations were being posted on the Internet, and in future the business community would be consulted on them in advance. The staff welcomed this, but noted that recent surveys of foreign investors had found that serious payments delays persisted (including for services transactions). It therefore encouraged the authorities to seek to reduce delays further, including by focusing enforce- ment more narrowly on problem entities, and establishing mechanisms to promote voluntary compliance. 51. Just following the Article IV mission, a staff team visited Beijing to assess the jurisdictional implications of the intensified enforcement of exchange and capital control regulations under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The mission’s conclusions will be set out in a supplement to be issued before the Executive Board meeting. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-44- F. Statistics and Y2K Issues 52. While much progress has been made in recent years, China’s economic statistics continue to suffer from serious weaknesses (Annex I), hampering macroeconomic analysis by both policy makers and outside analysts. The key problem areas include: (i) the GDP data, which are produced in a cumulative form during the year, without revisions of previous data, making it difficult to assess quarterly developments accurately or to make seasonal adjustments; (ii) the fiscal data, which exclude expenditures financed by external aid, some interest payments, and a large portion of the recent stimulus package, and where information on fiscal activities outside general government is very limited; (iii) monetary data provide only a limited breakdown of credit by borrower or economic sector, and foreign exchange transactions by residents are not yet consolidated (although progress is being made in this area); (iv) the financial sector where very limited data are available; and (v) the balance of payments and external debt data, where large errors and omissions, and discre- pancies with creditor debt data persist. Breaks in series-in part due to ongoing efforts to improve statistical methodologies-also limit the scope for time series analysis. 53. The staff therefore again underscored the importance of strengthening the statistical base. While technical assistance should continue to play an important role, the staffing levels in the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)-which were nearly halved during the recent civil service restructuring-might also need to be reconsidered. The staff also stressed the importance of improving data provision to the Fund during the year, particularly fiscal and external debt data. The authorities acknowledged that much remained to be done to strengthen the statistical base, which required continued technical cooperation and assistance from international organizations, including the Fund. They will consider more frequent provision of fiscal and external debt data to the Fund, but noted that fiscal data were available only with a long lag and even then were incomplete. 54. While China’s level of computerization is still relatively modest, many outside observers believe that the Y2K problem could lead to significant disruption (Box 9). The authorities agreed that China had got off to a late start in tackling the problem, but stated that preparations were much more advanced than outside experts had realized. Their latest survey--conducted in April 1999-concluded that almost all sectors had made reasonable progress, with the financial sector most advanced. A number of international organizations had been invited to make assessments of progress and provide assistance; in addition, contingency plans had been developed to limit any potential impact in critical sectors. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - Box 9: Y2K Issues in China With the use of computers still relatively new in China, most analysts agree that the potential for Y2K problems in China is less than in most developed countries. However, significant disruptions could occur because many vital sectors such as fmance, telecommunications, power, water supply, civil aviation and railways arc highly computerized. The potential problems are further complicated by the diversity of hardware and software in use; widespread use of pirated software; and a general tendency not to back up data, which makes it harder to shut down and repair systems The Chinese authorities got off to a late start in tackling the issue. Outside the financial sector, serious efforts only began following a State Council notice issued in August 1998, which required government computer systems to be revised by March 1999 and Y2K tests and modifications to be completed by September 1999. There has also been increasingly widespread publicity of Y2K issues, and training caters have been set up to help state run institutions address the problem. In addition, to help ease the funding shortage, enterprises have been granted selective tax breaks and a special loan program is being created. Based on the information available to the staff, progress varies significantly acmss sectors: . The financial sector has made most progress. The state media report that all fmancial institutions will have completed internal testing by May 1999, and external testing will be conducted through September. The stock exchanges, securities and futures industries, and civil aviation and telecommunications sectors are also reportedly making progress. . Efforts have started in power, railways, and taxes and customs. Less progress has been made in rural areas, and in many sectors including: food, retail and medical services, police and the military, and in the chemical and oil refining industry. . Awareness/progress is limited outside central and provincial governments. Large SOEs plan to complete testing in June, and fix the problems by September. However, an official survey of 512 large enterprises in February 1999 found that over half did not know how to identify the Y2K problem; only 30 percent of listed companies discussed the issue in their annual reports. Outside observers generally believe that China is likely to experience significant problems. In October 1998, the Gartner Group gave China the lowest rating for Y2K awareness/preparedness, and said that 66 percent ofthe companies in China would experience at least one critical system failure. Moody’s rates China’s banks as among the least prepared in Asia. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assesses a significant risk ofwidespread interruption of government services, and power and phone loss; it expects that food, water and oil shortages will be isolated but severe. It judges the chance of unrest OI bank panics to be moderate. The authorities acknowledged that progress in tackling the Y2K issue had been slow, and varied considerably across sectors due to a lack of awareness and a shortage of funds. However, surveys had led them to conclude that almost all sectors had made reasonable progress, and they expressed the view that the assessments by outside observers of China’s Y2K efforts were overly negative. These assessments have nevertheless prompted the authorities to strengthen their public relations efforts, including by directly addressing the issue at the APEC meetings in mid-April. In addition, the Global 2000 Coordinating Group will be visiting China in June to make an assessment and provide assistance, while the PBC has invited the BIS, the U.S. Fed, and the Reserve Bank of Australia to assess efforts in the financial sector. The authorities have also requested assistance from the World Bank. They stressed that contingency plans were in place for the areas considered most vulnerable, and noted that any disruptions would be localized.

Over the past year, China has continued to weather the Asian financial crisis considerably better than most countries in the region, aided by skillful macroeconomic management, its relatively strong external position, and-to some degree-the protection provided by capital controls. Nevertheless, the strains in the economy are clearly showing, reflected in weakening private demand, large capital outflows, and high unemployment. In addition, the financial position of the banks and state enterprises-and associated with this, the issue of long-run fiscal sustainability-continue to give rise to significant risks. 56. Over the coming year, the authorities face three key challenges: ensuring the macroeconomic policies provide adequate support to demand to create productive employ- ment and maintain social stability; ensuring that policies are supportive of the present exchange rate policy; and pressing ahead with critical structural reforms necessary to ensure high quality growth over the longer term. 57. The policy of maintaining the stability of the renminbi has served both China and the region well during the recent Asian crisis. The recent sharp cut in interest rates have opened up a substantial differential with foreign rates; this carries the risk of increasing pressures on the capital account, and the authorities will need to monitor market develop- ments closely and develop contingency plans. Moreover, with China likely to experience continued rapid structural change, greater exchange rate flexibility will be required. The authorities should be giving thought as to how and when such a transition might best be achieved. 58. The timely easing of fiscal policy in mid-1998 provided desirable support to demand, although the quality of the expenditures undertaken needs to be very closely monitored. With increasing downside risks to growth toward the end of 1999, a further modest fiscal stimulus-as the authorities are now planning-would be appropriate. With the pipeline of efficient inI%&ructure projects now much more limited following last year’s stimulus package, the staff would encourage the authorities to focus the additional spending on social safety net expenditures, which would be supportive of consumption and reforms. 59. While fiscal policy can play an important short-term role in supporting growth, it is clearly not a long-term solution. Thus, as in previous years, the central economic chageuge remains the reform of the financial and enterprise sectors, which continue to face very serious structural problems. The staff is encouraged by the authorities’ clear recognition of the problems in these sectors, and their determination to accelerate reforms before a crisis develops; this will be essential to maintain macroeconomic-including fiscal-stability and high quality growth over the medium term. 60. While data weakuesses preclude a full assessment, over the past year, important steps have been taken in financial sector reform. The staff encourages the authorities to’ Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 41_ move quickly to address outstanding operational issues relating to Ah4Cs, and to ensure that they are transparently financed through the budget. The development of a strong credit culture-through improving bank commercialization and independence, reforms to legal and accounting standards, improvements to classification and provisioning regulations, and strengthening bank supervision-will also be critical. This should be supported by measures to enhance competition, including new entry of foreign and domestic banks (subject to appropriate safeguards), and allowing outside investors to purchase shares in SCBs. 61. The financial difficulties of small financial institutions are also a source of risk. The staff supports the authorities’ decision to put the GITIC into bankruptcy in order to limit future moral hazard, and the decision to restructure the trust and investment companies; it urges that the authorities ensure the maximum possible transparency as the GITIC liquidation continues. The proposed introduction of limited deposit insurance for RCCs should be delayed until the financial position of the RCCs has been strengthened through an appropriate restructuring program, and supervisory capacity enhanced. 62. The success of financial sector reform continues to depend critically on reform of the SOEs. The staff supports the authorities’ emphasis on reducing capacity in key sectors, greater reliance on bankruptcies, and enhancing competition. Over the coming year, it will be especially important that the AMCs play a ml1 role in accelerating enterprise restructuring, supported by the necessary legal changes; there is also scope for direct sale of shares in SOEs to private investors, including foreigners. Continued efforts to strengthen the social safety net are also essential, building on the considerable progress made last year, including further interregional pooling and additional central government transfers to particularly hard hit regions. 63. The authorities’ recent initiatives to strengthen the private sector and the capital market will play an important role in supporting activity and reducing labor market pressures. In this connection, the staff attaches particular importance to improving firms’ access to capital; strengthening private property rights further; and reducing barriers to entry for private firms. It will be important that the operations of loan guarantee agencies are structured to avoid creating large contingent fiscal liabilities. 64. To support the reforms of the financial sector and the SOEs, urgent attention must be given to strengthening the government finances. While there is scope to reduce expenditures in certain areas-including by reducing the flow of new bad loan-further revenue mobilization-through strengthened administration and changes in tax policies- will be essential. The replacement of extra budgetary fees and charges by taxes is welcome from the perspectives of equity and efficiency, but will only improve the underlying fiscal situation if the expenditures that they presently finance can also be reduced. Attention also needs to be given to reforming the present system of inter-governmental fiscal relations, supported by technical assistance from the Bank or the Fund. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 48 - 65. The staff welcomes the progress that has been made in WTO negotiations, and looks forward to China’s early accession. Internationally, this will bring a major trading country into the framework of the world trading system. For China, while there will be adverse effects on certain sectors in the short run, it will strengthen competition, and provide support for the reforms that are necessary to secure China’s continued growth and long-term prosperity. 66. The intensification of enforcement of capital and exchange regulations and customs enforcement has been an appropriate response to evidence of widespread evasion. However, despite the authorities’ efforts, there are still reports of disruption to legitimate transactions, adversely affecting foreign direct investor sentiment. The staff encourages the authorities to strengthen their efforts to improve the efficiency of the controls in this area, including through focussing enforcement more narrowly on problem entities, and encouraging voluntary compliance. While capital account liberalization remains an important medium term goal, it should be carefully sequenced with financial and other reforms. 61. While much progress has been made in recent years, China’s economic statistics continue to suffer from serious weaknesses in many areas, hampering macroeconomic analysis, and increasing the margin of error in the assessment of economic risks and vulnerabilities. While technical assistance must continue to play an important role in data improvement, the authorities may also need to reconsider the staffing levels in the NBS. Limited provision of available data to the Fund in core areas, especially fiscal and external debt, has also hampered Fund surveillance, and the staff urges the authorities to strengthen their efforts in these areas. 68. While China’s dependence on computers is still relatively modest, the Y2K problem could lead to disruption, with potentially important macroeconomic implications. Given the limited time now available, efforts should continue to focus on developing contingency plans in critical sectors. 69. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with China take place on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 49 - ANNEX 1 China-Statistical Issues Data weaknesses 1. The authorities have sought to improve economic statistics with extensive technical assistance from the Fund and other international and bilateral institutions. Nevertheless, weaknesses as regards coverage, quality, frequency and timeliness of fhe data remain very serious and continue to affect the staffs ability to formulate a consistent view of macro- economic developments. 2. A multisector statistical mission visited China in September 1998 to conduct an assessment of China’s macroeconomic statistics and to further develop the strategy for technical cooperation between the Chinese authorities and the Fund to strengthen China’s statistical system. The mission also presented a seminar for agency officials on the GDDS. The authorities expressed interest in the GDDS as a framework in which to move toward international methodological standards, and a GDDS coordinator for China has been named. The main statistical issues and weaknesses are: Real sector 3. Data on the expenditure components of GDP are not available on a quarterly basis; nor are deflators for the expenditure components-either on a quarterly or annual basis. The data are produced in cumulative form, without revisions of previous data, making it difficult to assess quarterly developments accurately or to make seasonal adjustments. Constant price measures of GDP are also suspect because of deficiencies with the price indices used for deflating and their application. Nevertheless, the National Bureau of Statistics has made a number of improvements to the range and quality of national accounts data, including quarterly estimates of GDP by industry and estimates of GDP by type of expenditure. Further improvements are intended, including the adoption of the 1993 System of National Accounts, further development of income and expenditure data, and improvements to quarterly GDP estimates. However, no dates have been set. As in other countries, rapid economic change, including the expansion of the nonstate sector, present new problems for data compilation. The ability to change data collections is restricted by the decentralized nature of the statistical system. Extensive technical assistance has been provided from multilateral and bilateral sources. 4. Many observers have expressed concerns about the reliability of China’s economic statistics and their usefulness to policy makers and the public. Many analysts, including the World Bank, believe that GDP growth rates in China are overstated by l-2 percentage points. However, the discrepancy last year between strong GDP growth and very weak growth in ofher indicators of activity-including electricity production and freight traffic- caused some observers to suggest that the “usual” overstatement of growth had widened. Indeed, the December 1998 World Economic Outlook devoted a box to this issue, concluding that, while fhe data had to be interpreted with care, GDP growth rates in China provided arl Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5o- ANNEX I important indicator of broad economic trends (see Box 4.1, December 1998 World Economic Outlook). 5. Monthly industrial production, retail sales, and fixed investment data also have a shifting base that does not allow a consistent time series. Data revisions tend to be made without publishing the entire revised series. Retail sales and fixed investment data are published only in nominal, not real, terms. 6. The consumer price index is not produced in a time series format, as there are only comparisons with one month and one year earlier on shifting bases. Technical assistance missions in September 1991, April 1995, and June 1997 dealt with the concepts and methodology of internationally used index formulae. The authorities have received technical assistance and training on price index methodology under a cooperative program with Statistics Canada. The Fund has proposed that a follow-up mission on production of price data in time series format be held in August. Governmentfinance 7. Since 1994, China’s Ministry of Finance (MOF) has regularly reported annual GFS data for publication in the GFS Yearbook. The GFS database currently includes data on the central government budget for 199CL96, and on provincial and local governments for 199596. However, the data still exclude social security and most extrabudgetary operations. In GFS terms, the revenue classification does not fully distinguish between revenue and grants, tax and nontax revenue, and current and capital revenue. The presentation of expenditure is by function only and lacks an economic classification. 8. The MOF also reports annual GFS data for publication in IFS. Data, through 1998, relate to revenue, expenditure, and the deficit/surplus of the central provinces, counties, and municipal governments’ budgets. These data are provided with substantial delays. 9. The data reported to the area department for surveillance are more detailed than those in IFS and have improved somewhat in 1998-99, with an agreement between the resident representative’s office of the Fund and the Ministry of Finance on a quarterly schedule for data provision and discussion. However, selected key items have been provided only with substantial delays (including a breakdown of debt service), and definitional and coverage problems make it difficult to assess the fiscal situation. For example, some of the recent fiscal stimulus program was not recorded by the budget; the interest on the bonds issued to finance the stimulus program, and on the bankiig sector recapitalization bonds, was excluded from the budget as well. Moreover, expenditures (including onlending) associated with external aid are not recorded in the budget. The data also exclude any reporting on quasi- fiscal operations undertaken by the banking system through policy lending by state commercial banks and policy banks to SOEs. Finally, information on the extent of enterprise debt that is guaranteed by the government is also not available at this time. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-51- ANNEX1 Monetary accounts 10. The People’s Bank of China (PBC) commenced in June 1997 the reporting of revised monetary data to the Fund on the basis of the All-Accounts Reporting System. Some improvements have been made for the revised monetary data in classification of accounts of the monetary authorities and the banking institutions. However, although efforts are under- way, advances are still needed in the compilation and reporting of monetary data inclusive of foreign-currency-denominated accounts of residents and accounts of the branches of foreign banks in line with STA recommendations, most recently in the multisector statistics mission of September 1998 and a monetary statistics mission in April 1999. Although monthly monetary data are compiled by the PBC, their reporting to STA has ceased since January 1998. Currently, only quarterly monetary data are published in IFS. In addition, there are a number of breaks in the series, and comparable historical data are not provided. 11. Detailed breakdowns ofbank credit extended by industry (e.g., manufacturing, property, etc.), and by borrower (e.g., the various elements of the state and nonstate sectors) are very important for economic policymakers, and are available in many countries. The staff continues to encourage the authorities to prepare information of this nature for analytical purposes. 12. Following the September 1998 multisector mission, the authorities have planned to expedite the work on implementing STA’s recommendations for improving institutional coverage and bank account classification for monetary statistics. The PBC has recently committed to resume reporting of monthly data beginning with data of the second quarter of 1999 and has agreed to the publication of monthly monetary data in IFS. The PBC has also started sending monetary data to STA via e-mail. Balance ofpayments 13. Until 1996, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) compiled China’s balance of payments statistics based largely on information collected from various govem- ment agencies. To compile timely, accurate, and comprehensive balance of payments data, SAFE in January 1996 launched an “international transactions reporting system (ITRS).” This system utilizes bank transaction records to derive data on China’s various types of international transactions on goods, services, and capital flows. To supplement the ITRS, SAFE since early 1997 has developed four periodic surveys to collect data on financial flows in and out of the country. 14. The new system has significantly improved the coverage and timeliness of China’s balance of payments accounts. Currently, the data are compiled in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). In addition, such data are compiled on a quarterly basis, as opposed to semiannually in 1997 and annually in earlier years. Such data were recently provided, for the first time, to APD. Within the current account, component detail is available on goods, services, income, and transfers. Data on financial account, however, are available only for key functional categories with few component breakdowns. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - ANNEX1 The major steps that SAFE needs to take to refine the system to produce timely, accurate, and comprehensive data include (i) intensifying efforts to implement the periodic surveys to derive estimates of direct, portfolio and other investment flows; and (ii) strengthening the coverage of the ITRS. These are crucial to enhance the accuracy of data on China’s financial flows and reduce the magnitude of the persistently large net errors and omissions of the country’s balance of payments accounts. 15. The SAFE, in collaboration with the multitopic mission, developed a two-year work plan to strengthen the ITRS, and in particular, to improve the estimates of financial flows and reduce the net errors and omissions of the BOP accounts. The work plan includes developing data sources and estimation methods to derive more reliable estimates of trade credits and more reliable estimates of external bank assets and liabilities. 16. In relation to the work of the Fund Task Force on External Debt and Reserves, a Fund mission visited China during April 27-May 4, 1998 to discuss with the authorities the coverage, timeliness, and periodicity of China’s data on official reserves, reserves-related liabilities, as well as those on other external assets and liabilities, fmancial derivative activities, and other contingent and potential liabilities. Qualitative information on reserves was provided in the context of this mission although it was not possible to update that information for the 1999 mission. Data on external debt are apparently compiled semi- annually but published only an annual basis; these semiannual data have not been provided to Fund staff thus far. The mission found that, despite an ostensibly modest level of external vulnerability, there is an urgent need to strengthen external debt monitoring and compilation, while introducing additional transparency in data dissemination. On the compilation of external debt data, the mission recommended that better use be made of existing domestic data sources, that domestic data sources (from the banking and corporate sectors) be strengthened, and that full use be made of available external sources (especially BIS and OECD). 17. The multitopic mission also followed up on issues relating to external debt data. In an effort to strengthen external debt statistics, the SAFE continues to review the concepts, definitions, classifications, and coverage of the BIS, OECD, and World Bank databases and make the necessary adjustments to enhance the usefulness of the existing official data. The SAFE also plans to redesign the debt registration form, upgrade computer software and training, and implement an improved external debt compilation system. 18. The balance of payments data for 1997 and 1998 do not appear to fully reflect interest income on official foreign exchange reserves under the investment income credits item, The authorities have indicated that the 1997 data will be revised accordingly, but have not indicated the magnitude of the likely revision nor whether the 1998 data will be similarly revised. There are also very substantial inconsistencies between flows and changes in debt stocks well beyond what could be explained by exchange rate fluctuations or similar factors.

Reporting of data to STA for IFS has, in the past, tended to be sporadic and with a considerable time lag. Following the introduction of new reporting arrangements, the timeliness of consumer price, industrial production, trade value, and total GDP data in IFS has improved substantially. However, the range of information is relatively limited, with no data published on producer prices, wages, and trade volumes and prices/unit values. Data dissemination to the public 20. The publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin by the PBC has significantly improved the timing and coverage of publicly available data on the monetary accounts and the main real sector indicators. However, public access to data remains considerably below international standards. The monthly statistical publications do not contain many time series nor the disaggregation necessary for analysis. Moreover, several important time series, particularly on the main fiscal variables, are not released in a systematic and timely manner. Extensive annual economic data are available in various statistical yearbooks, but these are published nine months or more after the end of the year.

Projected Obligations to Fund: None VII. Exchange Arrangements: On January 1, 1994 the Chinese authorities introduced a unified exchange rate system. Under the new exchange system, domestic enterprises are required to sell their foreign exchange to designated banks and can freely purchase foreign exchange from banks for trade and trade- related transactions with the necessary import documentation. A managed float system was adopted on January 1, 1994 under which the PBC intervenes through the purchases and sales of foreign exchange in the interbank market to limit intraday volatility of the exchange rate. On May 30, 1998 the exchange rate was Y 8.3 per U.S. dollar. - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 56 - ANNEX II With regard to current account transactions, China accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Fund Agreement on December 1, 1996. There are repatriation and surrender requirements on proceeds from exports and from invisible transactions and current transfers. Domestic establishments must sell their export earnings to designated banks; foreign-funded enterprises (FFEs) may retain their export earnings. Importers must provide valid proof and commercial bills to obtain foreign exchange. As of October 15, 1997, certain domestic firms, on the basis of their capital and foreign trade positions, have been permitted to retain up to 15 percent of the value of their imports and exports in foreign exchange. From the second half of 1998, a broad range of new requirements have been implemented to expand the scope of documentation required for most forms of current transactions and require prior verification of the underlying transactions in some instances (e.g., the customs service must certify the value of imports before banks can provide foreign exchange for payment). Other measures have been introduced to further limit the channels through which foreign exchange may be obtained by closing foreign exchange swap centers and introducing regulations to discourage domestically-funded entities from conducting business with foreign banks operating in China. Exchange controls continue to apply to most capital transactions. In general, a capital account transaction requires the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). Equity purchases in China by nonresidents are limited to special shares (“B”shares). Nonresidents are not permitted to issue capital or money market securities in the domestic market, although sales of collective investment securities are possible, subject to approval. Purchases abroad of capital and money market instruments by residents are restricted to a few financial institutions and enterprises, as are foreign stock and bond issues, which also require prior approval. From the second half of 1998, additional measures have been introduced to prohibit prepayment of foreign debt and expand the range of transactions subject to registration as foreign debt to include, inter alia, payment terms for imports beyond 90 days. An annual foreign borrowing plan sets mandatory ceilings for all medium- and long-term borrowing by government departments and enterprises (except FFEs which are subject to individual limits negotiated in the investment approval process). External borrowing regulations were revised effective January 1, 1998. While SAFE will continue to be responsible for the approval and management of external borrowing, approval will now cover the financial situation of the enterprise, the need for the loan, and whether the terms of the loan are consistent with the use of the proceeds. For short-term loans (less than a year), the amount ofborrowing will be subject to an overall limit determined by SAFE on an annual basis (there are also enterprise-specific limits); enterprises can conduct business within this limit without explicit approval, but subject to reporting of activity to SAFE within one month. For medium- and long-term loans, approval will be subject to a limit determined by the State Development and Planning Commission, while the terms of the issue will be examined by SAFE. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - ANNEX II New regulations on guarantees by residents to nonresidents went into effect in January 1998, with the following key features: First, the concept of guarantees provided by authorized domestic institutions has been redefined and clarified. Under the new definition, guarantees consist of collateral, liens, and pledges in addition to what were commonly known as guarantees. Second, the approval process has changed. Banks do not need approval to issue guarantees, but must register them with SAFE. All other guarantees have to be approved by and registered with SAFE. Third, both domestic and foreign-currency-denominated guarantees are now covered by the regulations. Fourth, the approval process for guarantees has been clarified, and is now based on prospective guarantors’ profits, assets to liabilities, and asset-quality-ratio requirements. China also maintains controls on FDI, although it has generally pursued an “open door” policy toward FDI. In the case of outward direct investment, foreign exchange is provided after a SAFE review of sources of foreign exchange assets and an assessment of the investment risk involved, approval by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Cooperation (MOFTEC), and registration with SAFE. In the case of inward direct investment, nonresidents can invest in China subject to meeting certain regulations and MOFTEC approval. For environmental and security reasons, inward direct investment in some industries is prohibited. With regard to derivative transactions, domestic financial institutions and domestic firms cannot enter such transactions for speculation. However, transactions designed to hedge interest rate or exchange rate risk are possible. Positions entered into by nonfinancial institutions must be approved by SAFE, while positions entered into by financial institutions must be registered at SAFE. Transactions undertaken by FFEs do not need to be registered. With respect to the development of a forward foreign exchange market for the remninbi, the Bank of China has been permitted, as part of a pilot project, to offer forward transactions involving the renminbi, but the market remains small and proof of an underlying current transaction is required for access to forward cover. VIII. Article IV Consultation: Discussions for the 1998 Article IV consultation took place during April 27-May 11, 1998. The staff report (SM/98/170) was discussed by the Executive Board on July 29, 1998 (EBM/98/83). China is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. IX.

At the end of 1998, the financial system in China comprised four state commercial banks (SCBs), three policy banks, 98 other domestically owned commercial banks (including 10 joint-equity commercial banks, 88 city commercial banks), 173 operational entities representing foreign banks, about 45,000 credit cooperatives (including 3,240 urban credit cooperatives and 41,508 rural credit cooperatives), and various nonbank financial institutions (including 239 trust and investment corporations-TICS, 71 finance companies affiliated to industrial groups, and 15 leasing companies). All these institutions are under the supervision of the Peoples’ Bank of China. In addition, the financial system includes some 90 securities firms under the authority of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). 2. The banking system is dominated by the SCBs, which accounts for about 2/3 of the total assets (Table 1). The other domestically owned commercial banks have increased their market share to 11.2 percent, in part due to the transformation of urban credit cooperatives into city commercial banks; subsequently the share of the credit cooperatives has decreased to about 10 percent. The policy banks and the non-bank financial institutions (NBFls) have increased their market share to 8.7 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, while the market share of the foreign banks has decreased to about 1 percent.

Estimates by private analysts, however, are significantly higher.’ 4. Following a seminal conference on financial risks in November 1997-attended by almost the entire senior leadership-financial sector reforms have been significantly accelerated over the past 18 months. The following note provides a brief summary of the key measures taken since the last Article IV consultation,* and of the staffs recommendations. Restructuring financial institutions 5. The authorities are presently engaged in major efforts to restructure four groups of financial institutions: the SCBs, the rural credit cooperatives, the Trust and Investment Corporations (TICS), and the securities firms. State commercial banks 6. The restructuring strategy of the SCBs involved the establishment of policy banks in 1994 to relieve the banks from policy lending. Subsequently, in 1996, the SCBs were made responsible for the quality of new loans. In mid-1998, the authorities implemented a Y 270 billion recapitalization of the four SCBs. The recapitalization was designed to compensate them for their non performing loans with no residual value, and to bring their risk weighted capital adequacy ratios above 8 percent (measured on the basis of Chinese classification and provisioning standards). In early 1999, the authorities announced that asset management companies (AMCs) will be set up for each of the four SCBs. The first, for the China Construction Bank, was set up in April 1999, and the remainder are expected to be in place by the end of the year. The SCBs will then be expected to improve their capital base through internal profits or by issuing shares in the market (i.e., there is no plan for further recapitalization by the government). 7. AMCs will purchase non performing loans with some residual value from the SCBs at book value, in exchange for bonds. This will be a once off-operation with no opportunity to make further sales. They would seek to maximize recovery of the loan through a variety of vehicles, including direct sale, debt-equity swaps, debt restructuring, or liquidation (Box 2). However, a number of key issues concerning the AM&. operations remain to be resolved. In particular, while it is understood that the Ministry of Finance will be ultimately responsible for losses, it is unclear how the AMCs’ initial capital, or the interest payments on bonds ’ For example, recent estimates by Goldman Sachs suggest that the four SCBs taken together are technically insolvent, and that some $164 billion (16.5 percent of GDP) would be required to bring the capital adequacy ratio to 8 percent. 2 See “China-Recent Banking Reforms,” (W/98/170,7/6/98), for a discussion of earlier reforms. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-61 - ANNEX III provided to the SCBs, will be financed. It is also unclear how credit will be provided to enterprises undergoing restructuring. 8. The success of the AMCs will depend crucially on operational restructuring of the SCBs. In order to restrain the emergence of new bad loans, banks will sign “governance contracts” with the Ministry of Finance and the PBC under which they would have to meet certain performance targets, benchmarked on international best practices. Finally legislation will need to be drafted to give the AMCs the necessary powers to restructure enterprises. Rural credit cooperatives 9. The rural credit cooperatives, while individually very small, account for about 20 percent of household deposits; they lend primarily to farmers (32 percent), township and village enterprises (43 percent), and the private sector (25 percent). Since the 199Os, the performance of RCCs has been mixed. This can be attributed to poor management; the declining profitability of township and village enterprises; interest rate exposure in a context in which most of their deposits are at fixed interest rates and loan rates are declining; and high operating costs due to their small size. In addition, some RCCs may have suffered from contagion effects due to closure of Rural Cooperative Funds (RCFS).~ 10. With the assistance of the Asian Development Bank, the authorities have taken steps to restructure the RCCs, including establishing (i) a National Association which would be a self regulatory body and provide technical assistance to individual RCCs; (ii) a regional structure to supplement the 2500 RCCs at the county level; and (iii) a unified payments system. The authorities envisage merging (rather than liquidating), weak institutions with stronger ones at the county level; in the event that this is insufficient, the authorities may allow required reserves held at the PBC to be used to pay depositors in insolvent RCCs. The authorities are also considering establishing a deposit insurance scheme (DIS) for the RCCs, and a proposal is presently being considered by the State Council (Box 3). Trust and investment corporations (TICS) 11. The authorities noted that the recent difficulties in a number of TICS had evidenced the need to reassess their business scope. Over the years the financial conditions of the TICS. deteriorated due to a combination of factors, including poor management and deficient internal controls; a policy of diversification into a range of business (i.e., property development, securities trading) that are much riskier than the financing of investments in 3 RCFs were established by the Ministry of Agriculture to provide financial services to small farmers. PBC regulations (i.e., on deposit and lending rates and reserve requirements) did not apply to them. In 1997, the PBC decided to close the RCFs by merging solvent ones with RCCs or liquidating insolvent ones. The decision was motivated by the fact that RCFs had exceeded their original business scope.

In the specific case of the GITIC, it appeared that total liabilities amounted to $4.4 billion, while its assets were valued at $2.6 billion. 12. Against this background, the authorities intend to restructure and consolidate the TIC sector. In the future, TICS will only be allowed to undertake genuine trust business; they will be banned from doing banking and securities business; and they will no longer be allowed to borrow abroad. Consequently, the number of TICS will be substantially reduced, mainly through mergers and acquisitions. Local governments will be given one year to submit plans for the restructuring of their TICS. Securities firms 13. The new securities law enacted at the end of 1998 provided the legal basis for the development of China’s capital market. In particular, it enshrined the segregation of banking and securities business and of the regulatory and supervisory authority for banks and securities firms4 Furthermore, the CSRC issued regulations for the implementation of provisions of the new securities law with regard to minimum capital requirements for securities firms. The authorities plan to enforce the new rules gradually in order to give sufficient time for firms which do not comply to take appropriate measures. While some securities firms may face losses due to investments in the securities market with funds of their customers, the authorities believe that the problem is not large. A comprehensive assessment is expected to be completed by year end. Strengthening the institutional framework 14. The authorities have taken a number of steps to strengthen the institutional framework in order to develop the credit culture. These include plans to further enhance loan classification and provisioning rules; steps to achieve the operational restructuring of the SCBs; measures to strengthen supervisory responsibilities; and new legislation to support a sound business environment. Classification, provisioning and accounting regulations 15. Classification, provisioning and accounting regulations are all significantly below international standards. In mid-1998, the authorities announced a new five category loan classification system which was tested on an experimental basis in Guangdong Province, and is to be introduced nationwide by end-1999. Based on the initial results of the pilot, the authorities are considering a number of changes to the classification rules (Box 3), including 4 Supervisory responsibilities for securities firms were transferred to the CSRC during the course of 1998. Similar developments occurred in the insurance sector with respect to the Insurance Supervision Commission of China established in 1998. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-63 - ANNEX III a reduction in the trigger point for loans to be classified as substandard horn 1 year to 6 months (and eventually 3 months). These changes would bring the new system close to international standards. 16. Banks are subject to a maximum limit on provisioning of 1 percent, while interest can be accrued on overdue loans for 1 year. This results in a substantial overstatement of banks’ capital and profits. The authorities are considering replacing the existing 1 percent limit by a general provision of 1% percent and specific provisioning for each category in the new classification system (Box 3); and reducing the interest accrual period to 3 months within two years. Operational restructuring 17. The following measures were implemented by the SCBs to strengthen risk manage- ment: (i) establishment of internal control systems whereby borrowers are monitored after lending is extended; (ii) establishment of a “uniform credit approval” system whereby all the loans to single borrowers are consolidated and monitored; (iii) establishment of an independent supervisory board with representatives of the PBC, the Ministry of Finance and SETC, to oversee their operations and senior management; and (iv) a clarification of the responsibilities of the branches with regard to their ability to decide on loans approval with a view to curtail the ability of small branches to authorize loans. In addition, the SCBs have launched a downsizing campaign with a view to reducing their staff by 10 to 30 percent, and rationalize their branch structure. 18. Following the enactment of measures to make loan officers responsible for non- performing loans, credit risk assessment is increasingly becoming a binding constraint on the behavior of the banks. The nation-wide implementation of the new loan classification rules is also expected to raise the consciousness of bank managers to credit risks. It is also expected to provide a useful benchmark for bank supervisors when assessing the financial conditions of the banks. Finally, the new classification rules will pave the way for the introduction of minimum specific provisioning rules as discussed above. Supervisory responsibilities 19. The authorities took a number of initiatives during the course of 1998 to strengthen the prudential framework for the financial sector. Following the administrative reorganiza- tion of the PBC branch network the head office (with the assistance of the branches) is responsible for the supervision of the four SCBs on a consolidated basis rather than on a branch by branch basis, while the regional branches are responsible for the supervision of local financial institutions in their constituency.5 About half of PBC staff are involved in I ’ The PBC’s 30 provincial branches were replaced by 9 regional branches along the lines of the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase its operational independence from provincial (continued.. .)

A training institute for bank supervisors was established by the PBC in 1998; it plans to train 30,000 bank supervisors during the course of 1999. 20. Concerning the securities market, the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) took a number of steps to strengthen the supervision of securities firms. In particular, regional branches along the lines of the PBC regional structure were established to focus on supervisory functions; regulatory powers were centralized at the head office; and regulations were issued requiring professionals in the securities business to take qualifying exams. Business environment 21. In an effort to reduce financial risks and to support the development of a sound business environment, several pieces of legislation were introduced to crack down on illegal financial activities. In particular, legislation was introduced to define illegal financial activities in banking, securities and foreign exchange transactions, and to establish penalties for non compliance. Sanctions were taken by the PBC against bank officials found guilty of misconduct that had resulted in bad loans. In the foreign exchange sector, the uncovering of sizable fraudulent transactions triggered a strengthening of screening arrangements for international transactions, sanctions on bank officers responsible for fraudulent transactions, and a prohibition on banks’ branches undertaking foreign exchange business.6 Conclusions and recommendations 22. The staff welcomed the acceleration of financial sector reforms since late 1997. It made the following specific points. . A meaningful operational restructuring of the SCBs is of crucial importance for the success of the AM&. In this regard, full introduction of loan classification in line with best international practice, and the prompt introduction of the proposed rules for bad loans provisioning would support the development of the credit culture and the commercialization of the banking system. . While there is an understanding that the Ministry of Finance will ultimately be responsible for any final losses of the AMCs, the sources of working capital required governments. Financial supervisory offices were established in provincial capitals that do not have a regional branch. 6 The authorities reviewed the documentation associated with 51,900 international payments made during the first half of 1998 and determined that 13,900 could not be demonstrated to be legitimate; these accounted for $11.9 billion of foreign exchange. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 65 - ANNEX III for the purchase of NPLs have not yet been decided. Critical for their success of the Ah4Cs will be early recognition by the government of its responsibility for losses due to past policy lending. This should be done transparently through the budget. . The enactment of the legal framework giving the AhKs the necessary powers to restructure SOEs will be critical for their success. This involves a strengthening of the bankruptcy law which remains unduly biased against creditors. . Appropriate mechanisms will need to be set up for the provision of working capital to the enterprises undergoing a restructuring process. . A full assessment of the financial conditions of the nationwide and regional banks should be undertaken using international classification and provisioning standards in order to determine the size of the problem and design an appropriate strategy of restructuring and recapitalization. . The project to set up a DIS for the RCCs is broadly in line with international best practice. However, the introduction of deposit insurance in circumstances where the underlying position of the RCCs is weak runs a number of risks. In particular, the DIS may not be financially viable, and-because the guarantee will be limited in nature- there is a risk of encouraging depositors to shift deposits to other institutions that are perceived to have a full implicit guarantee (such as SCBs). Implementation of the DIS for the RCCs should be delayed until weaknesses in the prudential framework have been addressed, and the banking system is set on a sounder footing. . Establishing a strong bank supervision capacity is key for the prevention of financial risks. Efforts should be directed at implementing bank accounting principles fully consistent with International Accounting Standards; improving the implementation of supervisory standards in line with international best practices; and training of bank supervisors.

Asset Management Companies (AMCs) On AMCs, a proposal was sent by the PBC to the State Council on April 2, 1999, with the following main elements: . One AMC will be set up for each of the four SCBs. Following transmittal of the proposal, the State Council agreed in late April 1999 on the establishment of the first such company, Xinda AhK, the pilot project of the China Construction Bank. AMCs for the other SCBs are expected to be established by the end of 1999; . The AMCs would be owned and supervised by the Ministry of Finance. The life of AMCs is expected to be 8-10 years, Once established, primarily with staff drawn from the SCBs, they would operate entirely independent of the banks; . In a single transaction, the AMCs would buy at book value the bulk of NPLs, considered to have any residual value, and incurred from pre-1996 loans. Those assets considered to have no value would be written off. There would be no tirture opportunity to make further sales. In exchange the SCBs will receive long-term bonds, which they would expect to hold until maturity. The bonds would be implicitly obligations of the government, which would, therefore, accept any ultimate losses, through its ownership of the AMC, rather than through its ownership of the banks. The AMCs would also have access to PBC lending; . AMCs will be able to sell the claims, either to foreign investors, domestic private firms, existing foreign-owned companies in China, or sound state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Alternatively, the AMC could liquidate or negotiate a restructuring of the borrowers’ debts. The AMCs would be able to accept equity in exchange for debt. The could place the equity and arrange for others to provide loans to restructured companies. They could also access the corporate bond market; . The establishment of AMCs will remove the burden of NPLs from the SCBs. Subsequently, they are expected to focus on commercial lending activities; and . To achieve operational sustainability the SCBs will be required to improve credit risk assessment and management capabilities; they will sign “bank governance” contracts to this effect. The AMCs would sign memoranda of understanding with the Ministry of Finance and with the CSRC under which they will have to meet certain performance standards.

Deposit Insurance Scheme (DIS) PBC officials view a DIS as a structure to help deal with the problems faced in resolving small- and medium-sized urban and rural credit cooperatives and some regional banks. In particular, in the course of the past two years the PBC closed 42 deposit-taking institutions including one commercial bank, 23 urban credit cooperatives, and 18 rural credit cooperatives. In addition, the PBC closed 3 TICS. Although no accurate data are available at this juncture, many more face solvency problems that have arisen from weak management compounded by lax supervision. While no formal DIS is yet in place in China, the PBC has given priority to repaying small- and medium-sized household deposits whenever a liquidation process has taken place, and accepted an obligation to ensure all such deposits are repaid even if the liquidation proceeds are insufficient, so as to maintain depositor confidence. While many aspects of the DIS proposal remain to be resolved the following are the main features of the proposed DIS: . The DIS would be organized as an independent institution, funded by premia paid by member institutions (differentiated by institution). After an initial period, premia could be risk-adjusted; . Coverage would be limited, possibly applying only to small and medium income households; The ultimate objective would be to establish a centralized fund. However, given technical and legal problems, during an initial period, separate funds could be established for each categories of deposit-taking institutions, beginning with rural credit cooperatives (a proposal was sent to the State Council in early 1999), and then moving to urban credit cooperatives, city commercial banks and other commercial banks including the SCBs.

Classification rules The PBC is contemplating introducing modifications to the 5 category loan classification scheme used in the pilot project in Guangdong province. The following changes are under consideration: . Definition of Normal Loans: “No identified doubt that the loan cannot be repaid”, instead of “ loan contract fully complied with;” . Definition of Substandard Loans: “Main business operations (i.e., expected cash flows) and other means (in particular collateral) are insufficient to cover interest and principal servicing” instead of “cash flows from business operations;” . A reduction from one year to 6 months for overdue loans to be classified as non- performing. The objective of the PBC is to further reduce the period to 3 months (i.e., closer to best international practice). 2. Provisioning rules (including accrual of interests) Strengthened provisioning rules, as proposed by the PBC are the following: . The general provision would be raised from 1 percent to 1.5 percent. The general provision should be taken after income taxes are paid; . Minimum specific provisions on the basis of the 5 category loan classification as follows: special mention: 5 to 7 percent; substandard: 20 to 30 percent; idle: 50 percent; loss: 100 percent. Specific provisions should be taken before income taxes; . Special provisions to cover country risk (based on country risk rating) and specific industrial risks; . A further reduction in the period for accrual of interest from one year to 6 months and to 3 months within two years.

Combined IBBD/IDA lending in FY 1998 was $2.6 billion, slightly below the approximately $3.0 billion lent yearly to China in the mid-1990’s. Lending in FY 1999 is expected to total about $2.1 billion for 17 projects, and to remain at about that level over the next few years. The lower lending program reflects the government’s request for continued Bank support but at lower levels than in the recent past, given China’s high savings rate and increasing reliance on domestic resources. Increasingly, the government is calling on the Bank to provide non-lending services, particularly involving collaborative studies with the government on policy issues and participation in technical assistance activities. A summary of Bank commitments and disbursement to China is given in Table 1. The Bank’s overall assistance objectives in China are in the process of being redefined to respond to current realities. In the past, the overarching aim was to promote broad-based economic development and reduce poverty in an environmentaNy sustainable way. The assistance strategy had five focal areas: (i) implementation of macroeconomic and structural reforms; (ii) easing of infrastructure constraints; (iii) human development and reduction of poverty; (iv) agriculture and rural development; and (v) safeguarding the environment. However, China’s accelerated reform agenda in response to the regional crisis, its heightened concern with urban and environmental issues, particularly as they affect water resources, and the need to stimulate the economy through various means including investment in inkastructure have spurred the Bank to begin discussions with the Government of a revamped Bank assistance strategy suited to China’s current, pressing needs. Agreement on this strategy should be reached later in CY 1999. Details of the sectoral breakdown of past lending can be found in Table 2. Since 1990, the Bank has carried out studies in collaboration with Chinese counterparts in the fields of financial policies and institutional development, capital markets development, public investment and finance, budgetary and fiscal issues, national accounts assessments, trade policies, internal markets, reform and management arrangements for state enterprises, the social security system, health financing, price reform, housing reform, policies for higher education and for overall education policy in the 21” century, regional income disparities, urban employment, grain policy and food security, rural development, and provincial development strategies. Six country economic memoranda (CEMs) have been completed. The last full CEM, in 1997, assessed the state of China’s economy at that time and analyzed the range of development challenges facing China in the next century. The 1999 CEM focuses on the current challenges of maintaining near-term growth while reinforcing medium-term reforms and economic development. ‘Prepared by World Bank staff.

Capital Subscription: China holds 4,479 million shares or 2.87 percent of the total authorized capital of the IBRD. As of February 28,1999 China was fully subscribed with its paid up shares accounting for 2.9 percent of the total subscription. Technical Assistance: A technical assistance loan ($60.0 million) to the People’s Bank of China to enhance the central bank’s supervision, research, and clearing capabilities was approved in FY 1993. A second technical assistance project ($50.0 million), approved in the same year, is financing reform- supportive studies and economic research, the strengthening of core agencies responsible for macroeconomic management and local training institutions, and preinvestment support. Technical assistance for economic law reform was approved in FY 1995. Fiscal technical assistance, also approved in FY 1995, supports the implementation of recent fiscal reforms by developing and establishing a new National Tax Administration, and by developing an intergovernmental grants scheme and improved budgetary practices. In FY 1999, a technical assistance project for accounting reform ($33.0 million) has been approved and additional technical assistance projects are expected to be approved for pension and enterprise reform ($5.0 million each) as well as for support to economic research and preinvestment ($45.0 million). Resident Mission: A resident IBRD office in Beijing has been in operation since October 1985. In October 1997, responsibility for managing the Bank’s total program for China was decentralized to the Beijing office. International Finance Corporation (IFC): IFC commitments held as of March 3 1, 1999 total about $235.7 million in loans and $55.6 million in equity, of which $206.7 million of the loans and $45.8 million of the equity are disbursed. This does not include $403.6 million in loan commitments held for participants, of which $347.4 million is disbursed. A resident IFC office in Beijing has been in operation since 1992. The focus of IFC’s activities in China is on pioneering transactions and demonstration projects focused on five core objectives: (i) developing limited recourse financing; (ii) supporting the restructuring of SOEs; (iii) promoting the liberalization and modemization of the financial sector; _ (iv) assisting the development of indigenous (nonstate) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 72 - ANNEX V enterprises and SMEs (such as township and village enterprises); and (v) increasing the focus on interior provinces.

These three broad objectives will help maximize employment generation, further eliminate factor market distortions, and address market failures of rapid growth by spreading the benefits of growth more evenly, and minimizing environmental degradation. Accordingly, the AsDB has given significant attention to reinforcing market-oriented reforms, developing efficient financial markets, restructuring the industrial sector, and improving agricultural productivity. By increasingly focusing the operational program on inland provinces and rural areas where the poor are concentrated, the AsDB is also addressing the government’s objective to eradicate poverty by the year 2000 and bring about a more balanced pattern of development. Environmental projects aim at pollution control, human resource development in management, and institutional strengthening of environmental agencies, while natural resource conservation projects aim at soil and industrial energy conservation. Since China became a member of the AsDB in 1986,69 project loans totaling $8,076.7 mil- lion (see Table 1) have been approved as of December 3 1, 1998. In addition, the AsDB has approved one line of equity for $3 million, four equity investments totaling $44.3 million, two loans of $90 million to the private sector without government guarantee, and 303 technical assistance projects amounting to $146.7 million. The 1999 lending program is estimated at $1,315.6 million for 8 projects. The loan projects include: Northeast Flood Damage Rehabilitation ($330 million); Shanxi Environment Improvement ($102 million); Southern Yunnan Road Development ($250 million); Shanxi Road Development ($250 million); Zhejiang-Shanxi Water Supply II ($82 million); Shanghai Suzhou Creek Rehabilitation ($300 million); and a TA loan on National Automated Payments System ($1.6 million). In addition, the proposed technical assistance program for 1999 includes 25 projects totaling $18.5 million. The program is aimed at assisting the government prepare projects for possible AsDB financing; undertaking policy studies in support of the reform program; and strengthening the capacities of selected government institutions involved in policy analysis and implementation as well as the executing agencies of AsDB-financed projects. Overall, China has demonstrated a strong project implementation capability. Generally, loans are declared effective on time and most projects are completed within the planned period. Loan disbursement and contract award performance is good (see Table 2). Of the 69 loan projects approved as of December 3 1, 1998,23 are fully disbursed and closed, 46 are under implementation, while 9 loans had yet to be made effective. ‘Prepared by the staff of the Asian Development Bank.

Since 1991, transport and communications has emerged as the leading sector followed by energy, industry, development finance, social infrastructure, and agriculture and agro industry. The AsDB’s proposed operational program in the next few years will follow the same pattern in order to address the critical issues associated with rapid economic growth, such as transport bottlenecks and energy shortages. The sectoral distribution of loans over the medium term will continue to be dominated by physical intmstructure. The AsDB’s proposed program in the next few years will also address two other major issues: growing income disparities and environmental degradation. Particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that environmental issues are addressed and that the project beneficiaries include the poor. Increased attention will be given to the less developed inland provinces; about 70 percent of the proposed projects in AsDB’s operational program for 1997-2001 are located in inland provinces compared with 40 percent during the 1987-96 period. The strategic thrust of projects in AsDB’s major project areas is now shifting to inland provinces. The AsDB’s lending program will continue to be supported by a technical assistance program aimed at assisting the govetnment in carrying out policy reforms as well as in formulating quality projects. Support will also be provided to the government in seeking alternative financing such as private sector participation through build-operate-own projects. The ongoing restructuring of the industrial sector is expected to provide opportunities for foreign equity investment in selected enterprises in China, which will be facilitated through continued AsDB support for the development of the country’s capital markets, the use of equity investments to mobilize international funds for investment in China, and arranging for cotinancing with commercial banks. China views regional cooperation as an essential part of its strategy for integration with the world economy. The AsDB is facilitating China’s participation by providing technical assistance; China is an active participant in the AsDB-approved Regional Technical Assistance (RETA) project for Promoting Cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion. China is also pursuing cooperation with the Central Asian Republics through three AsDB- financed technical assistance projects (the Kyrgyz Republic and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Power Development Study; a Conference on Regional Economic Development Along the New Asian-European Continental Land Bridge; and Regional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia). The AsDB will continue to exchange views with the government concerning the country’s ongoing reforms. Such policy discussions, to be facilitated through the provisions of advisory technical assistance and the AsDB’s economic and sector work, will focus on financial, fiscal, legal, and enterprise reforms, and sector level reforms which implement the AsDB’s lending program. Institutional development will also continue to be a key feature of the AsDB’s operations in China.
