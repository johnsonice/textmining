How- ever, the initial adjustment effort fell short of what was needed, and the economy suffered a setback in 1995 owing to widespread damage from two hurricanes. Policy issues 0 Given the weak public savings situation and virtually no foreign financing, public investment is insufficient to maintain the basic infrastructure and support the key tourism industry. External arrears are continuing to rise. l Reductions in the wage bill, which accounts for two thirds of non-interest current outlays, and in other current spending should be central to the fiscal adjustment, but the authorities remain reluctant to consider significant layoffs of public employees. Tax revenues are well below those in other countries of the region, and need to be substantially increased. a A strategy is needed to address the buildup in arrears and normal& relations with external creditors. Staff position 0 To improve growth prospects, a strong and comprehensive adjustment effort over several years is needed to raise public saving and investment, and address the external debt problem. 0 The spending reductions announced in the 1996 budget would represent a significant step, but there are risks of slippages in the wage bill, and a phased retrenchment program should be started without delay. 0 The Government’s capacity to monitor and implement the program needs to be improved, and expenditure control procedures should be strengthened. 0 To restore external creditworthiness, a multilateral approach to dealing with the debt problem would be preferable to the Government’s bilateral strategy.

Introduction The 1996 Article IV consultation discussions with Antigua and Barbuda were held in St. John’s during May 13-24. Meetings were held with the Prime Minister; the Minister of Finance; the Minister of Public Works, Transport and Energy; other senior government officials, and private sector representatives. 11 Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. There are no outstanding obligations to the Fund. The previous Article IV consultation was concluded on May 1, 1995. Executive Directors noted the continued deterioration in the fiscal situation and the lack of progress toward normalizing relations with external creditors. They called on the authorities to adopt a comprehensive program that would raise public savings and deal with the country’s arrears problem, as well as help mobilize resources for much needed investment in the areas of infrastructure and environmental protection. Directors’ concerns were communicated to the authorities in a letter from management, and follow-up discussions were held in St. John’s in July and September 1995 and subsequently at headquarters during the Annual Meetings and in February 1996. In these discussions, the authorities acknowledged the seriousness of the situation and expressed their determination to take strong measures. At the same time, they reiterated their intention to implement a “home-grown” adjustment program, with help from regional institutions, in preference to seeking a financial arrangement from the Fund. Economic analysis in Antigua and Barbuda is hampered by data weaknesses in key areas. Comprehensive and timely monetary data are provided by the ECCB, but the quality and coverage of the other core minimum data provided by the authorities need to be improved. Moreover, the national accounts, public finance, labor market, and balance of payments data are weak and are produced with long lags. These problems, and the authorities’ efforts to address them, are discussed in more detail in Appendix II. XI. Background A. Economic setting Antigua and Barbuda’s economy is heavily dependent on tourism, reflecting an economic development strategy during the 1980s that focussed on exploiting the country’s main natural resource--its numerous white sand beaches--through the construction of hotels, airport, and cruise-ship facilities. Tourism now accounts for 87 percent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings and the hotel sector employs about one fourth of the labor force (the other major employer is the public sector, which accounts for one third of the labor force). A World 11 The staff team comprised Messrs. Tweedie (Head), Lewis, Schwidrowski, and Levy Yeyati (all WHD), and Ms. McCuskey (Assistant-WHD). Mr. Rainford, Advisor to the Executive Director for Antigua and Barbuda, and staff members from the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) also participated in the discussions.

A/ This strategy contributed to strong output growth (real GDP increased on average by 8 percent a year in 1983-89) and average per capita income rose from less than US$2,000 in the early 1980s to US$7,800 in 1995, the highest level in the Eastern Caribbean region. However, there also was a marked deterioration in the public finances in this period, as revenues stagnated while expenditures expanded on account of increases in capital outlays and the wage bill. Heavy government borrowing on commercial terms raised the external public debt from 32 percent of GDP in 1980 to 80 percent in 1989. As the Government failed to meet its debt-service obligations, external arrears accumulated rapidly. 21 Output growth slowed to 3 112 percent a year in 1990-94 as growth in the tourism sector slackened and public investment fell sharply because of reduced access to foreign financing (Box 1 and Charts 1 and 2). Inflation remained below 4 percent a year on average, reflecting the monetary discipline associated with membership in the Eastern Caribbean monetary union. Despite the slower growth, unemployment remained relatively low (official estimates put the unemployment rate at 7 percent in 1994), owing to further increases in public employment. Fiscal performance continued to be weak, as evidenced by the low current primary surplus of the public sector, and the Government increasingly sought to tap domestic financing sources (Charts 3, 4, and 5). Lower domestic investment contributed to a narrowing of the external current account deficit from 14 percent of GDP in 1990 to 5 percent in 1994, while an overall external deficit was financed mainly through the accumulation of arrears (Table 1). B. Recent developments The economy suffered a severe disruption as a result of the damage caused by Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn in September 1995. Direct hurricane-related losses were estimated at US$300 million (60 percent of GDP), of which about half was covered by insurance. Output fell by 4 percent in 1995 as lower tourism activity more than offset sharply higher private investment associated with the reconstruction effort. The investment spending was financed by a large rise in private savings associated with the receipt of funds from insurance, such that the external current account deficit actually declined somewhat (see below). Most hotels closed temporarily, and although hotel capacity was restored to 90 percent of pre-hurricane levels by the end of 1995, tourism receipts remained below normal levels through the first four months of 1996 as air arrivals recovered only gradually and many hotels reduced their peak season tariffs. Inflation remained low (Table 2). The public finances came under added pressure in 1995 as the overall fiscal deficit widened from 5 percent of GDP in 1994 to over 8 percent. Tax revenues increased only I/ “Antigua and Barbuda: Recent Economic Performance and Prospects,” World Bank, May 1992. More recent estimates are not available. 21 The arrears arise from insufficient budgetary resources, rather than from a governmental limitation on the availability or the use of foreign exchange, and thus do not give rise to an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval.

Recent and Prospective Tourism Trends Tourism activity--predominantly air and cruise-ship travel--grew rapidly during 1980-88, driven initially by a recovery of the U.S. economy and sustained by rapid growth in arrivals from Europe. Several large hotel projects were completed and tourist arrivals grew at an annual rate of about 8 l/2 percent; real daily tourist expenditure in U.S. dollar terms increased at an annual rate of about 4 l/2 percent in this period. The Government supported the sector’s growth through heavy investment in infrastructure that included improvements to the airport and cruise-ship port; a water desalination plant; and a duty-free shopping area. In 1989-95, the annual growth of tourist arrivals slowed to 1 l/2 percent a year, and estimates point to declines in daily average tourist expenditure during the past few years, which is reflected in a deterioration in the terms of trade. These developments are in part explained by the disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo in 1989; the drop in tourist arrivals in the wake of the Middle East crisis in 1991; and Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn in 1995. However, they also may reflect a deterioration of the country’s competitive position vis-bvis other tourist destinations (Mexico, Dominican Republic, and other Caribbean islands) owing to the high real wage increases granted in Antigua and Barbuda during the 1980s. There also has been a shift toward “all-inclusive” resorts that represent about 50 percent of the country’s hotel capacity and tend to make a smaller contribution to the local economy. Arrivals from North America have stagnated since the late 1980s. Rapid growth in European tourist arrivals helped to offset this development, especially since European tourists tend to stay longer, and this trend also helped extend the tourist season from the traditional winter months to the summer. The share of Europeans in total air arrivals increased from 19 percent in 1988 to 40 percent in 1995 through active promotion and new direct flight connections; the share of North American tourists fell from 55 percent to 41 percent during the same period. However, recent data suggest that European arrivals have been declining since their peak in the 1994 summer season, and more recently a number of direct flights, in particular from Germany, were canceled. The external environment for potential growth in the tourism sector in the coming years will be closely linked to growth prospects for the U.S. and European economies. However, competition from other tourist destinations is increasing, and Antigua and Barbuda needs to intensify its efforts to capture this growth potential, through measures to improve cost competitiveness, an active tourism promotion strategy, improvements to the basic infrastructure, and measures to address incipient environmental problems. In addition, given the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters, a strengthening of the public finances will be essential to provide a higher level of public savings that would allow the Government to respond quickly in the case of future tropical storm damage.

The small increase in current central government revenues was broadly offset by higher non-interest current outlays, while the performance of the public utilities deteriorated markedly in the aftermath of the hurricanes. Capital outlays also rose by close to 1 percent of GDP, reflecting the purchase of land for a new hospital. The deficit was financed through a further accumulation of external arrears (estimated at 74 percent of GDP at end-1995), and sharply higher domestic commercial borrowing (Table 3). 21 As a member of the Eastern Caribbean monetary union, Antigua and Barbuda does not have an independent monetary policy. Growth in broad money (M2) was broadly in line with nominal GDP in 1994 but accelerated to 21 percent in 1995, as a result of the large inflows to settle insurance claims late in the year (Table 4). Private sector credit demand was sluggish in 1994, but demand for consumer and mortgage loans rose in 1995 in response to a fall in bank lending rates in late 1994. Most banks reported some increase in nonperforming loans in 1995, owing to the effects of the hurricanes on bank borrowers as well as a tightening of loan provisioning guidelines by the ECCB. Interest rates were broadly unchanged in 1995. The overall balance of payments deficit was about 2 percent of GDP in 1995, and was financed by further arrears accumulation (Tables 5 and 6). Despite the fall in tourism receipts, staff estimates suggest that the external current account deficit narrowed in 1995 to 4 percent of GDP as a result of the large insurance inflows from abroad. The capital account registered a small surplus, as direct investment more than offset the scheduled amortization on external public debt (most of the debt is now in arrears) and an increase in the net foreign assets of commercial banks. The real effective exchange rate was little changed in 1995 (Chart 6). The Government is pursuing a bilateral approach to the external arrears problem. In 1995, the Government completed repayments on two previously rescheduled loans that were being serviced with earmarked revenues, reduced outstanding obligations to regional organizations, and settled part of its arrears to the CDB. The remaining CDB arrears were cleared in April 1996, with a view to restoring access to new concessional financing from that institution. 31 However, no progress was made regarding the arrears on major loans that carry the guarantee of official export credit agencies and constitute the largest part of the country’s outstanding external debt. 4/ I/ Including a wage levy earmarked for education (personal income is not taxed), an extension of the restaurant sales tax to nonhotel establishments, and increased taxes on tourism.

Report on the Policy Discussions The discussions centered on (i) the adequacy of the fiscal measures announced in the 19% budget to deal with the country 3financial imbalances; (ii) the need to establishcfiscal targets for the consolidated public sector rather than just the Central Government and to develop systems for monitoring compliance with the targets: and (iii) a medium-term framework that would permtt higher public investment and help deal with the arrears problem and restore relations with external creditors. In these discussions, the mission stressed that the fiscal adjustment estimated for 19% fell short of what was required, even allowing for the afrer- eflects of the hurricanes in 1995. Thus, a stronger and more comprehensive adjusnnent eflort was needed to improve medium-term growth prospects. The mission also reiterated the stafl view that a multilateral resolution of the arrears problem o$ered better prospects for restoring creditworthiness than the authorities ’ bilateral approach. A. Outlook for 1996 Output is projected to grow by 5 percent in 1996, reflecting a partial recovery of tourism and the carryover of post-hurricane reconstruction. However, the prospects for a sustained recovery in tourism are unclear, and private investment continues to be adversely affected by uncertainty over the public finances. Inflation is expected to remain subdued, although efforts to reduce the underinvoicing of imports could lead to some price increases. The external current account deficit is projected to widen temporarily to 9 percent of GDP in 1996 as tourism receipts would remain low, and the overall external deficit of 4 112 percent of GDP is likely to be financed through a further accumulation of external arrears. 1. Fiscal policy The mission estimated that the current primary surplus of the public sector would increase by 2 l/2 percentage points to 5 112 percent of GDP in 1996, and with capital spending and net lending at a similar level to 1995, the mission estimated an overall fiscal deficit of 5 percent of GDP in 1996. Additional fiscal measures announced in the 1996 budget included a strengthening of tax administration, a 7.5 percent reduction in the wage bill, I/ a two-year wage freeze, and a lowering of other current outlays. The mission noted that such an outcome was a step in the right direction, particularly as tax revenues would not have fully recovered from the effects of the September 1995 hurricanes. However, it would only restore the current primary surplus to its 1994 level and, thus, fell short of the needed adjustment. To improve tax performance, the Government has contracted an external consultant and established a new enforcement unit to strengthen collections and reduce evasion. The unit aims to increase import tax collections by curbing underinvoicing, and will propose measures to improve the yield of the hotel and corporate income taxes. The mission welcomed this initiative but noted that substantial revenue gains also may require a modification of the tax structure to reduce the present high dependence on indirect taxes. For this reason, previous Fund missions had recommended the introduction of a personal income tax, and the mission urged the authorities to keep this and other options under review. Moreover, there is I/ Excluding backpay but including a reduction in outlays on the vocational training scheme. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- a need to simplify the tax structure and improve the design of some existing taxes, curtail the granting of tax exemptions, and strengthen the main tax collection agencies. As regards efforts to reduce current spending, the mission estimated that the measures announced to date--a shorter work week in some areas, temporary layoffs, and removal of pensioners from the payroll-were unlikely to achieve the desired reduction in the wage bill. Moreover, the Government had yet to develop a plan for implementing the reductions, or to establish adequate systems for monitoring compliance with the targets (which also need to be broadened to include the operations of the statutory bodies outside the Central Government). The authorities indicated that they would step up efforts to monitor progress in meeting the budget targets, but remained reluctant to implement widespread layoffs of public employees, as recommended by the ECCB, l/ because of concerns that higher unemployment could increase the incidence of crime and adversely affect tourism. Moreover, they are planning an organizational study of the public sector before considering wider reductions in public employment. Technical assistance has been requested for this study, but the results are unlikely to be available before late 1997. The authorities also indicated that they intend to seek assistance to implement needed improvements in budgeting, accounting, and expenditure control (Box 2). In this area, as with tax administration, the Government so far has not taken full advantage of a regional initiative to strengthen public sector financial management. 2/ An improvement in the operating surplus of the statutory bodies of 1 112 percentage points of GDP is projected in 1996, mainly reflecting a post-hurricane recovery in revenues of the public utilities authority (APUA), combined with continuing efforts to strengthen the collection of receivables. In 1996, the Government will contract out a study on options for improving the efficiency of the Port Authority, including the introduction of private sector management. The Government started making its current contributions to the Social Security Scheme in 1996, and plans to reduce its arrears to the scheme (estimated at 12 percent of GDP at end-1995) through the transfer of government lands. The projections also include net lending of l/2 percent of GDP for a new government housing project to be financed by the Social Security Scheme. Based on the increase in public savings and available financing, fixed capital formation was projected by the staff at 4 percent of GDP in 1996, which would remain below the levels needed to maintain basic infrastructure. To supplement its investment outlays, the Government recently signed a contract for the supply of new electricity generation capacity by the private sector under a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) arrangement, and similar arrangements are being considered for the construction of a government office complex and a new hospital. The mission noted that such arrangements may help the Government address its immediate financing constraint, but they also entail commitments to contractual payments on commercial terms over an extended period. Accordingly, the staff team advised the Government to conduct a A/ In a December 1995 report on the Government’s home-grown adjustment program, the ECCB recommended a number of fiscal measures, the most important of which was that the civil service be reduced by 18-24 percent (implying a fiscal saving of about 1 percent of GDP). 21 The Eastern Caribbean Economic Management Program (ECEMP), which is financed by the Canadian International Development Agency.

Deficiencies io the Systems for Budgeting and Fiil Monitoring Current systems for &Cal budgeting and monitoring need to be strengthened through improvements in the Treasury’s accounting procedures, modemization of the legal framework for public sector financial management, computerixation of treasury operations, and improvements in the technical capacity of staff in the Budget Office and the Treasury. Some of the major deficiencies are as follows: Budgeting system and expenditure control l Financial regulations concerning government expenditure have not been revised significantly since 1962; they are inconsistent with the 1985 Finance and Audit Act and often are not observed. Revised regulations drafted in 1993 have not yet been adopted. l The Treasury does not record expenditure commitments or accruals prior to the submission of payment vouchers. As a result, there is no systematic cash flow management, and spending beyond authorized limits is difficult to control. l Once the annual estimates are approved by Parliament, there is no mechanism to limit monthly or quarterly expenditure by individual spending units. l The advance warrants system permits spending not previously author&d by Parliament; the subsequent process of supplementary parliamentary authorizations reduces accountability. 0 Accounting and bill payment systems are largely manual, which inhibits timely data production and increases the risk of clerical errors. l The most recent audited accounts are for 1984; accounts through 1989 have been submitted to the Auditor General. Some of the delay reflects the heavy reliance on manual systems for producing budgetary data and reconciling treasury and banking data. l Public investment programming lacks well-defined objectives, priorities, and project selection criteria; is not framed within a multiyear planning context; and does not make adequate provision for associated future recurrent costs. Fiscal accounting, reporting, and monitoring l Some government transactions that do not pass through treasury accounts (including the receipt and use of certain earmarked revenues, and noncash transactions) are omitted from the Treasury’s budgetary data. l The Budget Office compiles analytical tables for revenue and expenditure only on a quarterly basis and with a lag of two to three months (staffing constraints preclude the processing of monthly data). 0 Government revenue and expenditure data are generally not reconciled with financing data. l The Ministry of Finance does not monitor the financial operations of public enterprises or other public sector entities outside the Central Government on a systematic basis. There is a need to include accounts for the consolidated public sector in both the annual budget estimates and the focal accounts. The authorities’ fiscal accounts need to reconcile the statutory bodies’ accruals data with the central government data, which are mostly on a cash basis.

The mission stressed the importance of addressing the external arrears problem and reducing the public debt to manageable levels, including through the use of privatixation receipts. Staff projections show a substantial financing gap in 1996, which may be reflected in a further buildup of external arrears. The authorities acknowledged the poor communication with creditors and the lack of information on the amounts owed (in part reflecting uncertainty about the rate at which penalty interest is accruing on the amounts in arrears). They expressed their intention to resume more intensive discussions with creditors in the coming months, and to establish an escrow account at the ECCB for the purpose of depositing funds for debt service, pending the completion of such discussions The mission stressed the need for the Government to clarify the size of the debt outstanding, and to be more explicit with creditors about its plans for economic adjustment and for increasing debt-service payments in the coming years. The mission urged the Government to avoid further recourse to domestic commercial borrowing. It noted that large-scale domestic borrowing--as took place in 1995-- was not consistent with the aim of restoring fiscal viability, as such loans typically carry high interest rates (11-13 percent) and the requirement that current revenues be earmarked for future debt service. In addition, increased bank exposure to the Government could raise prudential concerns and threaten the viability of the common currency arrangements in the event that the Government is unable to service these loans, as was the case in late 1995. 2. Structural policies Prospects for diversification away from tourism are limited in the short term, such that strong efforts to improve the competitiveness of the tourism sector will be needed. In this regard, the maintenance of labor competitiveness, improved tourism promotion, and protection of the environment will be essential for growth. There are no data on recent trends in labor competitiveness, but partial indicators suggest that labor costs in Antigua and Barbuda are high by Caribbean standards. Under the current exchange rate arrangements, improvements in this area will depend on wage restraint and gains in productivity. As regards the former, the two-year Government wage freeze and a one-year freeze on wages that has been agreed in the hotel sector should help moderate private sector wage pressures in the near term. In addition, the mission stressed that a high degree of labor market flexibility will be essential to facilitate the needed absorption of public sector employees by the private sector. Increasing competition from other tourist destinations highlights the need for an active promotion of the tourism sector. However, promotional efforts by the Ministry of Tourism in recent years have been hampered by inadequate funding and lack of qualified staff. To address these weaknesses, the Government indicated its intention to establish a Tourism Development Corporation by early 1997, which would be managed primarily by private sector representatives and funded in part by tourism tax receipts. The need for public sector support of this kind of activity highlights the importance of strengthening the public finances in other areas. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- The mission urged the authorities to give a higher priority to privatization, both as a means of increasing the role of the private sector and as part of the solution to the external debt problem. To this end, the proceeds from future asset sales should be used primarily for debt reduction. Reducing the role of the public sector also should play an important role in efforts to improve productivity. The Government intends to sell the Heritage Hotel and its equity holding in the New Port Company in 1996, and to use the proceeds to construct a new mall for street vendors. Public assets identified for sale in subsequent years include the Government’s equity in a regional airline (1997), the Telephone Department of APUA, and the Royal Antiguan Hotel (1998). Possible proceeds from these asset sales are estimated at US$50-60 million. In the exchange and trade area, as part of a regional initiative the maximum amount of foreign currency that can be taken out of the country without approval from the Ministry of Finance was increased recently from EC$lOO to EC$lOO,OOO. Approval in excess of this limit is granted for all bona fide current international transactions. The authorities also remain committed to implementing the common external tariff (CET) of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). However, in view of the revenue effect of the hurricane-related disruption, they have requested a temporary postponement of the deadline for implementing the second phase of the CET (previously scheduled for September 1995). A revised time frame has yet to be agreed. The consistency with commitments under the CET of the 5 percent customs service charge on imports will be reviewed as part of a study of the role of such charges in the region to be conducted by a CARICOM consultant. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the World Trade Organization. Beyond the maintenance of the basic infrastructure, the Government recognizes the critical importance of environmental protection for future growth prospects, particularly given the economy’s heavy dependence on tourism. However, existing environmental legislation is inadequate, inter-agency collaboration is weak, and environmental impact studies need to be incorporated more fully in the design of new investment projects. Other issues include illegal sand mining, and inadequate waste disposal procedures. The Government intends to introduce an umbrella environmental act, which will strengthen the role of the Environmental Division of the Tourism Ministry. Also, Antigua and Barbuda is participating in a World Bank-led regional solid waste management project, which was expected to start in 1996 but may be delayed if the participating countries do not satisfy the loan conditionality of the project. B. Medium-term prospects The mission prepared a medium-term baseline scenario for the period 1997-2001 to illustrate the implications of failing to strengthen fiscal policy (Table 7). The mission estimated that, without more vigorous measures to reduce public employment and control other current spending, current non-interest outlays could continue to rise in the medium term. While it is too early to assess the possible effects of efforts to improve tax compliance, it was assumed that this initiative would at least assist in offsetting the lack of buoyancy that has been evident in the tax structure in recent years. On the basis of these assumptions, and in the absence of a significant improvement in the finances of the public enterprises, a gradual deterioration in public savings was projected for the period 1997-2001. Under this scenario, the Government would not be able to increase external debt-service payments significantly above current levels, and the problems with Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - external creditors would continue. The resulting financing constraints also would limit public investment to well below the levels needed to maintain the basic infrastructure and support the tourism industry. In such an environment, there is a risk that tourism receipts would stagnate, and that economic growth would slow to less than 2 percent a year over the medium term. The mission discussed an alternative medium-term adjustment scenario (Table 8) that illustrated the benefits of a front-loaded adjustment starting in the second half of 1996. The scenario would target an increase in the current primary surplus of the public sector of about 5 percent of GDP over the period 1996-98 (relative to the baseline), and an increase in public investment outlays to 6 percent of GDP (compared with less than 2 percent of GDP at the end of the projection period under the baseline scenario). A/ The external current account deficit would decline to 5 l/2 percent of GDP by 2001, financed mainly by direct investment. In view of the Government’s bilateral approach to the external debt problem, no assumption of debt rescheduling was made, and access to new official financing was expected to be restored only gradually. Nevertheless, external arrears could be stabilized by 1998 and the provisioning for substantially higher debt-service payments was expected to improve prospects for normalizing relations with external creditors. The staff estimated that such a strong fiscal adjustment, combined with an improved climate for private investment, could permit sustained economic growth of 5 percent a year in the outer years. The fiscal adjustment under the alternative scenario would need to include a significant reduction in current government spending, particularly a lowering of the wage bill through the early introduction of a phased retrenchment program. Overstaffing also needs to be addressed urgently in the public enterprises, together with improved collection of receivables by APUA, a review of the adequacy of existing public tariffs, and a rationalization of the operations of the Port Authority. Part of the fiscal adjustment also should come from higher tax receipts. The mission noted the difficulties in projecting the effects of the authorities’ efforts to strengthen tax administration and urged them to establish quarterly targets for improving tax collections in 1996-97. The authorities should stand ready to take additional fiscal measures--including a shift to greater reliance on direct taxes--if the anticipated improvement in revenue performance is not achieved in a timely manner. On the basis of these discussions, the authorities presented a Medium-Term Economic Strategy Paper (MTESP) to donors and creditors at the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED) meetings in June 1996 in which they quantified the size of the fiscal problem and outlined a medium-term strategy for addressing it. This presentation represents a further significant step toward a more comprehensive and far-reaching adjustment, but considerable efforts will be needed in the coming months to develop specific adjustment measures and ensure their effective implementation. I/ More analysis is required to identify specific investment needs and priorities in Antigua and Barbuda and articulate a detailed public investment strategy. However, the World Bank has estimated that, for countries in the region, public investment of 8-10 percent of GDP or higher may be needed to sustain an appropriate rate of output growth.

Staff Appraisal Economic growth slowed markedly in the first half of the 1990s as tourism was sluggish and weak public savings coupled with a large stock of external arrears forced the Government to curtail public investment. To strengthen the public finances, the Government initiated a “home-grown” adjustment program in 1994 with assistance from regional institutions. The measures adopted in 1994-95 focussed mainly on raising revenues through increases in indirect taxes and the introduction of a wage levy for education. However, the effectiveness of these measures was undermined in 1995 by weaknesses in their implementation, delays in strengthening tax administration and curbing tax exemptions, and the disruption caused by two severe hurricanes. No significant steps were taken to reduce the size of the civil service or to lower current outlays. The extensive hurricane damage in 1995 placed added pressures on the public finances. Tourism receipts have not yet fully rebounded and the prospects for a sustained recovery of tourism are uncertain. Private sector confidence appears to be weak and new investment activity is largely on hold. In the wake of the natural disasters, the Government faced a difficult choice of whether to continue on a gradual adjustment path, or embark on a more comprehensive and far-reaching program. In the event, it chose the former, albeit with some strengthening of its program. While this approach may be socially and politically expedient in the short run, there are serious risks that it will not be sufficient to restore the economy to a sustainable path of even moderate growth. In the absence of a major adjustment effort, Antigua and Barbuda will face an increasingly difficult situation. If implemented as planned, the spending reductions announced in the 1996 budget would represent a significant first step toward the needed adjustment. However, there are risks of slippages (particularly in the area of the wage bill) and the Government needs to move swiftly to ensure that the targeted savings are achieved. Technical assistance is being sought to strengthen budgeting, accounting, and expenditure control procedures, and the Government should ensure that assistance in this and other areas is used effectively. To improve prospects for the needed additional spending restraint beyond 1996, the Government should reconsider its decision to delay significant cuts in the civil service until after a study of the public administration is completed. The staff commends the Government for establishing a tax compliance unit, with external technical assistance, aimed at strengthening collections and reducing evasion. This initiative needs to be complemented by early measures to strengthen the main revenue collection agencies, rationalize the tax structure, and curtail the granting of tax exemptions. More generally, the Government should give priority to revenue mobilization, and be willing to take additional measures if the hoped for revenue gains are not achieved. Greater efficiency in the public enterprises will need to play an important role in the fiscal consolidation. The staff welcomes the Government’s intention to improve efficiency in the Port Authority as well as efforts to improve the collection of receivables and to cut back on overstaffing in APUA. More generally, there is a need to incorporate the public enterprises formally within the adjustment program through the setting of performance targets and improved monitoring procedures. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - Privatization should play a central role in the adjustment, including as part of the efforts to address the external debt overhang, and to increase the private sector’s role in the provision of basic services. The staff urges the authorities to advance their timetable for asset sales and to use the receipts from these sales to reduce public sector debt. A carefully articulated debt management strategy will be essential to assist in restoring the Government’s external creditworthiness. In the staff’s view, a multilateral resolution of the external arrears problem would offer better prospects for success than the Government’s bilateral approach. Although progress toward the regularization of the external arrears situation has been slow, recent government moves to clear its arrears to the CDB and intensify contacts with other creditors represent a positive development and the Government should step up its efforts toward the normalization of relations with external creditors in the period ahead. In this connection, early contacts with creditors will be needed to clarify the size of the outstanding debt and allow the Government to outline its plans for increasing debt-service payments in the coming years. In the meantime, the Government should refrain from incurring new external or domestic obligations on nonconcessional terms. The present exchange rate arrangements have provided an important source of monetary and exchange rate stability, notwithstanding the weak state of the public finances, and these arrangements should be maintained. Given the size of current imbalances, a strong and comprehensive adjustment effort over several years will be needed to improve growth prospects by permitting a lasting recovery in public investment and normalizing relations with external creditors. It is important that this adjustment be front-loaded to restore private sector confidence, facilitate a quick recovery in public investment, and’increase access to external technical and financial assistance. The Government’s recent presentation of a medium-term adjustment strategy to the donor community represents an important step in this direction. However, major challenges remain to ensure that the needed adjustment measures are implemented in a sustained manner. Improvements in the quality, availability, and timeliness of economic statistics are needed to provide an adequate basis for policy making, and to increase awareness within the country of recent trends, including the magnitude of the economic problems and the need for adjustment. Greater transparency in the fiscal accounts also would play an important role in this regard. The staff welcomes the measures taken during the past year to strengthen the Statistics Division of the Ministry of Finance and to resume limited publication of macroeconomic data, and urges the authorities to intensify their efforts to upgrade the provision of economic statistics in the period ahead. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The authorities do not compile or publish fiscal data for the consolidated public sector, and the _ principal source of information on the Central Government is the annual budget (which does not present data by economic classification). The most recent statistical yearbook was published in 1988, national accounts data are subject to long lags, and coverage of labor “markets and the balance of payments is weak. During the past year, the Government has ini- tiated efforts to strengthen the Statistics Division (SD) of the Ministry of Finance through an internal reorganization and the hiring of new staff. In addition, the SD has taken steps to improve the public dissemination of economic data through the publication of a new statistical digest and the resumption of publication of an interim consumer price index. The shortcomings in the existing data, and the authorities’ efforts to address them, are described in greater detail below. Real sector Annual national accounts by sector are prepared by the SD with support from the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The estimates are based in part on industry surveys, but the response rates are poor. The most recent data available are for 1993. Provisional estimates for 1994-95 were provided during the mission. There are no official estimates for the expenditure components of GDP. During 1995 the SD began to take over responsibility from the OECS for the production of national accounts statistics, and additional staff were hired. The SD is in the process of updating the base year for the constant price GDP series from 1977 to 1990. In 1994, the SD started compiling an “interim” monthly consumer price index (CPI), to replace the previous CPI which was based on an outdated household budget survey (HBS) of 1969. The new index was developed with technical assistance from the Fund as an interim measure until a new HBS is conducted. The SD resumed publication of the interim CPI in October 1995, and the index is being published with a lag of less than one month. The index still exhibits substantial ,month-to-month variability, suggesting possible problems with quality control. A revised CPI will be produced on the basis of a new HBS, which should be conducted in 1996-97 with assistance from the ECCB. There are no data on employment or wages in the private sector, and the most recent survey of public employment is for September 1994. Fiscal sector No fiscal data are reported to STA for publication by the Fund. The authorities compile quarterly data on central government revenue and expenditure, and partial annual data on the financing of the central government deficit. The public enterprises and the social security and medical benefits schemes produce annual financial statements that are not monitored adequately by the Ministry of Finance. High priority needs to be given to the reconciliation of the above- and below-the-line accounts of the Central Government; the compilation of consolidated public Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicl - 23 - APPENDIX II sector accounts; and more timely and frequent reporting. Also, there is a need to compile and reconcile data on intra-public sector arrears. Monetary sector The monetary data are reported by the ECCB on a monthly basis. Data on the central bank balance sheet are normally available with a three-week lag, while data for the commercial banks are produced with a lag of about six weeks. Certain issues regarding the methodology used for the monetary survey need to be clarified. The ECCB plans shortly to extend the monetary survey to cover the operations of nonbank deposit-taking institutions. External sector External trade data prepared by the SD are compiled manually and subject to long lags (the most recent annual trade report is for 1990). Aggregate trade data estimates are available for 1994, but the quality of import data is poor. To address these problems, the SD will shortly be shifting to the ASYCUDA/EUROTRACE computerized system currently used in several other Caribbean countries. Data on tourist arrivals are compiled by the Caribbean Tourism Organisation (CTO) with a lag of less than a month. However, estimates for tourism receipts are currently based on a CT0 survey of average daily expenditure per tourist dating back to 1988. The results of a new CT0 survey completed in 1995 are expected to be released by mid-1996, and significant revisions to the historical series may be necessary. The SD compiles balance of payments data on an annual basis, with assistance from the ECCB. However, the data are not published, and are subject to a high degree of estimation. The Ministry of Finance uses a debt reporting system to produce data on cash external debt transactions and provisional calculations of arrears for part of the country’s external obligations. The ECCB is providing assistance in broadening the coverage of the debt reporting system to include all external public sector obligations and to accurately reflect the accrual of penalty interest and other original loan conditions.
