Introduction A staff team u visited Aruba during May 3-10, 1995 for the Article IV consultation discussions. Aruba is not en independent Fund member, but has autonomous status within the Kingdom of the Netherlands; Aruba and Dutch authorities have requested separate Article IV consultation discussions. The acceptance by the Kingdom of the Netherlands of the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3. end 4 in 1961 applies to Aruba. The last Article IV consultation discussions were concluded et EBM/93/77 on May 28, 1993. Executive Directors noted that rapid growth and the virtual elimination of unemployment had begun to generate inflationary pressures which they feared could erode international competitiveness. In this context, they stressed the need for tighter fiscal policies, es well es for supply side measures to ease the existing labor shortages. They also expressed concern over the poor quality of economic statistics. II. Backeround Aruba is a smell island in the Caribbean, 24 km. from the northern coast of Venezuela, with a 1993 population of 78,000. Its location is the foundation of its two main industries: tourism end oil refining. These industries have helped generate a per capita GDP estimated et $16,400 in 1993, one of the highest in the region. When Aruba achieved autonomous status in 1986, its economy was in a deep slump associated with the closing of the oil refinery the year before; unemployment was over 20 percent, and many Arubans emigrated, especially to the Netherlands. The next few years witnessed very rapid growth, which L/ Mr. Lane (Head), Messrs. Bakker, Baras, and Halikias, with Ms. Thomas es Administrative Assistant (all ELJl).

Tourist facilities were expended; arrivals tripled during the 1966-92 period end revenues increased by an average of 19 percent per year. .Another important element was the 1989 agreement to reopen the oil refinery; a new owner undertook substantial investments to refurbish end expand the facilities, which became fully operational in 1993. With rapid growth, the economy reached supply constraints, especially in the labor market: the unemployment rate dropped below 1 percent in the early 199Os, and was 0.5 percent in 1994. Workers were drawn in from abroad. and by 1995 over a third of the workforce were foreigners. The influx of foreign workers also put upward pressure on housing prices and rents. Consumer price inflation accelerated from 3.9 percent (year-on-year) in 1992 to 5.2 percent in 1993 and 6.3 percent in 1994, then tapered off to 5 percent by March 1995 (Chart 2). This pattern of inflation reflected tight labor and housing market conditions as well es the introduction in 1993 of a 5 percentage point increase in import duties which was rescinded in October 1994. The CPI uses an assumed figure for the rise in rents, which may understate the actual increase; end price controls apply to goods which in 1993 accounted for nearly one-fifth of the CPI basket. As the Aruban florin (Af.) remains pegged to the U.S. dollar, it appreciated by about 5 percent in real effective terms from 1992 to 1994 (Chart 3). u The current account surplus rose from some 3 percent of GDP in 1993 to 5 percent in 1994. The improvement was more then fully explained by a one- off de-stocking in the oil refinery. The non-oil trade balance deteriorated. Tourism revenues declined by 3 percent (in dollar terms) in 1994; this may in pert be a result of the imposition of exchange controls and other problems in Venezuela--a major source of tourist arrivals. With a deficit in the capital account--attributable mainly to repatriation of foreign direct investment in the oil sector--the balance of payments registered an overall surplus of some 1 percent of GDP. Aruba's fiscal position improved over the past several years, es revenues increased with the growing economy while expenditures increased JJ Aruba has no national accounts, so figures on GDP and its components are official and staff estimates. Year-to-year movements may have little economic significance, as they may reflect measurement error end irregularities in the timing of payments. 2/ The absence of data on wages and on prices of tourist services implies that any assessment of Aruba's competitiveness is necessarily tentative.

It shifted from a deficit of some 3 percent of GDP in 1992 to near balance in 1993 and 1994. 1/ A new government took office in September 1994, and introduced a new 1995 budget. This budget projected lower tax revenues, owing mainly to the elimination of an import tariff surcharge introduced in 1993. The budget also included spending increases associated with the new government's programs, which were to be more than offset by other spending cuts. The overall result was current budget balance, compared with a small surplus projected under unchanged policies. The budget also envisaged cuts in public investment, resulting in an overall projected surplus of some 0.5 percentage points of GDP. Fiscal Adjustment in 1995 Budget (In Dercentaee ooints of GDP) Current Balance - unchanged policies 0.3 Reduced revenues - 0.7 Expenditure increases - new programs - 1.0 Expenditure cuts 1.3 Current balance - Monetary control is implemented mainly through ceilings on the annual expansion of domestic credit by each bank. Until 1994, these ceilings were enforced through moral suasion. The ceilings were progressively lowered from 15 percent in 1990 to 7 percent in 1992 through 1994. In 1994, the banks broke through the ceiling, expanding credit by 17 percent. In 1995, explicit penalties were introduced for exceeding the ceilings. The central bank also maintains a system of capital controls. A system of licensing applies to certain capital inflows, including those related to direct foreign investment, external loans. and nonresident purchase of u These judgements must be tentative due to the inadequacy of the data. Hitherto, total expenditures have been calculated as a residual, and thus cannot be separated from net lending, non-registered borrowing (including arrears), lending to public institutions, and errors and omissions. The government is now preparing more complete expenditure data on a transactions basis; these are so far available only for 1990, with preliminary data (with the likelihood of significant revisions) for 1993 and 1994. These data are not directly comparable with budget data.

There are also restrictions on residents' holdings of foreign assets, although the limits were increased in 1992. Banks' foreign positions are subject to a ceiling (the 'B-9' limit) for prudential reasons and to concentrate international reserves in the central bank. u There are also limits on long-term capital outflows, although proceeds from the liquidation of direct foreign investments are not subject to these limits. Import tariffs are levied at a single rate of 7.5 percent; a 5-percentage-point increase in this rate was introduced in July 1993 and rescinded in October 1994. Goods imported for re-export through the "free zone" are exempt. Only one product, eggs, is subject to a quantitative import restriction. Some significant deficiencies in Aruba's economic statistics remain (see Appendix III). The core financial surveillance data are available with l-2 month lag, but other key data needed to interpret them--such as national accounts, and data on wages and on prices of tourist services, needed to assess Aruba's international competitiveness--do not exist. Moreover, data on public expenditures have been seriously deficient, although this problem is now being addressed. There have been some other recent improvements, notably the introduction of labor force and enterprise surveys and plans to develop national accounts later this year. II. Policv Discussions The discussions were held against the background of continuing rapid expansion of aggregate demand and economic activity, as characterized in the previous section. This rapid growth had resulted in tight labor market conditions, leading to a runup of wages as well as an influx of foreign labor; the latter, in turn, had also contributed to excess demand in the housing market. The ensuing inflationary tendencies were reflected in inflation above rates prevailing in the U.S. and in nearby tourist destinations; given the fixed exchange rate, this threatened to undermine u Payments relating to interest, loan amortization, profits and dividends, and the depreciation of investments may be made provided that the underlying capital transaction complied with the licensing requirement. u A bank's "B-9" position is defined as its total claims on foreign residents in foreign currencies; under the regulations, this position is limited to no more than 10 percent of residents' Af. and foreign currency deposits.

Jf While Aruba's external current account remained in surplus. owing chiefly to one-off factors, some erosion of competitiveness was evident in the underlying current account conditions: tourist revenues declined in 1994 and the non-oil trade balance deteriorated. Moreover, both the external and the fiscal position were vulnerable to shocks, particularly given the relative lack of diversification of Aruba's small economy. In this light, the key concern was how to prevent excess demand from leadi?g to continuing inflation which could further undermine Aruba's competitiveness, ultimately making the fixed exchange rate unsustainable. With regard to fiscal policy, the staff stressed the need for further consolidation, together with a moderation of support for economic development given the overheating of the economy. Although Aruba's fiscal position slightly in surplus, the mission argued that stronger surpluses would be more prudent, particularly as the economy was operating above potential. The authorities pointed out that they had undertaken to reduce government spending in both 1995 and 1996. For 1995, they had introduced a scheme to encourage the voluntary departure of some 7 l/2 percent of public employees by offering a lump sum, consisting of 18 months' average salary, to those who leave. (The lump-sum payments are off-budget in the official data, and thus only the reduction in payroll expenditures affects 1995 spending as officially presented.) Reducing public sector staffing would not only improve the fiscal position, but also help alleviate tight labor market conditions by releasing labor into the private sector. For the 1996 budget, under preparation at the time of the mission, the authorities intended to cut spending by a further 10 percent, by reorganizing the whole public administration and reducing staff selectively. The staff welcomed the plans to cut spending, but emphasized the need for adequate measures to implement them. With regard to the program of incentives for voluntary separations, there was the risk that the employees who left would be the most highly-qualified ones whose skills would be difficult to replace from elsewhere in the public service; if this happened, the lump-sum package would not result in a sustainable reduction in public- sector personnel costs. The authorities noted, however, that because the lump sun was invariant with respect to an employee's salary, it would therefore be relatively more attractive to lower-paid employees without specialized skills. The government had also reserved the right to rescind the lump-sum offer to employees whose departure would be disruptive. m=y acknowledged, however, that problems were emerging in some areas--notably u Illustrative medium-term projections prepared by the staff suggest that, to prevent a further acceleration of inflation, the rate of economic growth would have to slow to 2 percent over the 1996-2000 period, with a corresponding reduction in private investment. Details of these projections are presented in the background document.

The authorities explained that one of their key objectives was to imploment a social policy to distribute the benefits of economic growth more widely. The official minimum wage had been increased, and general pension benefits had been doubled over the past two years, bringing them to an estimated subsistence level; this latter increase was being financed by higher employer contributions. The government also planned to increase welfare benefits, and to introduce a pension plan for the private sector and a general health insurance program for the entire population. The authorities indicated that they intended, at the same time, to reduce the number of recipients of certain welfare benefits through tighter enforcement of eligibility rules. The mission appreciated the objectives of this social policy, and welcomed the direct link between extending benefits and raising contribution rates. However, prospective demographic developments required that contributions be raised or benefits lowered to be consistent with the funds' long-run solvency. The staff also sounded a note of caution with regard to the effects of these initiatives on the labor market. In particular, the improvement of pension and welfare benefits, together with the increase in contributions, would have a negative effect on work incentives, which it would be difficult to offset through stricter enforcement; this could exacerbate an already tight labor market situation. The new government also emphasized its plans to effect a major reversal in immigration policy. Within the next 4 years, the government planned to cancel the work permits of 3/4 of the 13,000 foreign workers now in Aruba-- thus sending home a quarter of the existing labor force. It also intended to bring back Arubans who had gone to the Netherlands in the mid-1980s--over 8,000 of whom had indicated in a survey that they would like to return. Government job centers were to be reoriented to collect data on the expiry date of foreigners' work permits, with a view to training Arubans (resident or abroad) to fill specific jobs now occupied by foreigners. The authorities said that support for economic development would be focused on quality improvement and diversification, and aimed at a more moderate growth rate, 4-5 percent per year, over the next five years. They believed these goals were attainable, notwithstanding shortages already apparent in labor markets and the intended shedding of foreign labor. They hoped to increase the Aruban labor force by bringing home the expatriates; transferring superfluous government workers to the private sector; putting people off the welfare rolls and into the workforce; and encouraging higher female labor force participation by promoting more flexible working arrangements and providing state support for child care. They also hoped to spur productivity increases (at a target annual rate of 3 l/2 percent, following a decade in which average productivity had been declining) through job training as well as the application of total quality management (TQH) techniques.

The new government had also put a moratorium on all new tax incentives through October 1995. but viewed it as important to continue to provide incentives in several areas, particularly with a view to diversifying the economy and moving the tourist industry up-market. In addition, the authorities had sought to encourage development through infrastructure investment; they planned, in particular, to undertake or support major investments in housing and transportation. The anchor of Aruba's monetary policy is the fixed exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. The authorities indicated that the primary objective of monetary policy was to maintain a level of international reserves adequate to defend the currency. They noted that, since mid-1994, reserves expressed on a six-month moving-average basis had remained within their target range of 5-6 months' non-oil imports; the current level of reserves, however, had slipped temporarily below 5 months' imports in late 1994, but as of April was again within the target range. An important secondary objective of monetary policy was to restrain domestic inflation. With regard to the implementation of monetary policy, the authorities acknowledged the problems associated with bank-specific credit ceilings, including the stifling of competition and the incentives for disintermediation. The ceilings had also resulted in a buildup of excess liquidity, which, among other things, had made official interest rates irrelevant. For 1995, the central bank had introduced some changes that would make the ceilings less distortionary: including mortgage lending under the ceiling would reduce banks' incentive to favor this form of credit, and permitting banks to sell any unused room under the ceilings to one another would foster competitiveness and efficiency. The authorities indicated an interest in moving further toward a more market-oriented approach, and noted, in this regard, the recent introduction of cash reserve requirements. The mission agreed that reserve requirements were potentially a useful part of a system in which central bank liquidity management and official interest rates would have greater leverage over deposit and lending rates and credit. There was a need to go further, however: in particular, to introduce policy instruments that would permit the central bank to absorb liquidity, providing a role for open market operations and officisl interest rates and reducing the role of credit ceilings in policy implementation. The authorities indicated that this was the direction in which they would like to go. but said they wanted to find a way to do this without compromising central bank profitability, which they viewed as a precondition for central bank independence. The staff suggested that, if central bank profitability were viewed as a constraint, the structure of reserve requirements and remuneration on central bank deposits could be adjusted to yield the target seignorage revenues while reducing the distortionary effect at the margin.

They acknowledged, however, the limited effectiveness of capital controls in a small open economy such as Aruba's, in which there were many channels for circumventing the controls. Ceilings on foreign investment by individuals had accordingly been raised, and this would expose the domestic banking industry to greater competition. In the same spirit, the staff encouraged the authorities to explore further steps toward the liberalization of capital movements. In particular, the present controls on capital inflows required that the central bank evaluate the suitability of individual investment projects, extending the central bank's role into the area of industrial policy. While the monetary authorities agreed that capital controls were distortionary and limited in their effectiveness, they saw their use as second-best: the central bank's only available instruments to subdue inflation in the face of pressures generated by other aspects of policy. Offshore finance is becoming increasingly important in Aruba. The offshore banks' total assets more than doubled from 1991 to 1993, and amounted to more than twice the assets of the domestic banking sector. Establishment of offshore banks is limited to branches of banks whose home countries carry out consolidated supervision of their worldwide operations. Other aspects of offshore finance are less tightly controlled, however; in particular, Aruba law permits the establishment of Aruba-exempt companies (AWs) that, for the payment of a flat fee, are allowed to establish and operate free of taxation and supervision. The authorities indicated their intention (as part of their plan to diversify the economy) to encourage a further expansion of such offshore financial activity--including, for instance, allowing mutual funds to be established as AWs. The staff expressed concern that rapid further expansion of this kind of activity could compromise the quality of the activity, possibly undermining the integrity of Aruba's financial system. IV. Staff Auoraisti Aruba is facing the strains of success. The island's economy made a remarkable recovery from the slump of the mid-1980s, stimulated by policies that encouraged II&I development through loan guarantees and tax concessions. In the event, the encouragement for development--through tax concessions, loan guarantees, and associated infrastructure investment--turned out to have gone too far, leading to strains that are now manifest mainly in labor and housing markets. The resulting inflationary pressures require policy adjustments, including a more restrictive fiscal policy and the acceptance of a less ambitious pace of economic growth. In this regard, recent moves to shed labor inefficiently employed in the public sector are welcome. However. plans for voluntary departures of public servants are by themselves unlikely to accomplish a sustained reduction in government spending; it is essential Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - that the government follow through with more detailed plans to restructure government from the ground up. Cuts in (officially recorded) government spending planned for 1995 are projected to be more than sufficient to compensate for additional spending on new programs and for the loss of revenue resulting from the reduction of import tariffs; therefore, a small surplus is anticipated. However, this surplus is smaller than would have occurred if the automatic stabilizers had been allowed to work, as would have been appropriate especially given the overheating economy. Moreover, the projected expenditure savings are not based on a convincing set of measures; if these savings fail to materialize, the resulting overshooting of expenditures could be of the order of 1 percentage point of GDP. In addition, the overall fiscal impact includes the effect of the payment of the lump-sum severance package to government workers, recorded off-budget; this is equivalent to a one-time transfer of some 1 percentage point of GDP. In all, therefore, the direction of fiscal policy in 1995 is likely to be expansionary. Plans to carry out a deep cut in overall government spending in 1996 would, if achieved, be a welcome fiscal correction. However, it is difficult to see how these cuts will be accomplished unless there is some stepping back from ambitious government policies in several areas--including infrastructure investment, support for a massive expansion of the residential housing stock, improvements in education and training, and a" expansion of social programs. The authorities anticipate that most of the savings would come from cutting waste in government; while this is a commendable aim, experience elsewhere does not suggest that large savings from this source are likely to be effected rapidly. It seems clear to the staff that more effort will be needed if fiscal policy is to play a" appropriate role in dampening aggregate demand. The authorities' growth objective, which they characterize as "moderate", is in fact overly ambitious in light of evidence of serious strains in labor and housing markets, as well as the intention of reducing reliance on foreign labor. An improvement of productivity is possible-- although it is not clear what instruments the authorities have to effect this--but not of a magnitude sufficient to ease supply constraints and support growth of 4-5 percent. Likewise, the hoped-for increase in labor force participation is unlikely to occur, particularly given the recent and planned extensions of the social safety "et. I" sum, the staff believes that present policies are aimed at a growth rate that is incompatible with the island's physical and human resources. Even to the extent that development is oriented toward diversifying the economy rather than increasing its size, the required investments will still strain the economy's capacity and may move economic activity into areas in which Aruba lacks any comparative advantage. Moreover, if the authorities do indeed carry out plans to "send home" a quarter of their labor force, this would seriously exacerbate the already strained labor market situation, and put further upward pressure on wages. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 The fixed exchange rate between the Aruban florin and the U.S. dollar means that monetary policy has limited effectiveness in restraining domestic demand. Although the authorities have resorted to a combination of quantitative credit restrictions and capital controls in an attempt to gain some monetary independence, these can only be partially and temporarily effective, and they risk distorting the process of financial intermediation. Accordingly, the brunt of the effort at restraining inflation should be borne by fiscal policy, and especially a less active approach to economic development. There is scope to move further in the direction of market-based monetary policy. At present, however, this scope has been limited especially by the lack of competition and the effects of credit restraints on the financial system. In developing a domestic money market, it will be essential to open up the system to more foreign participation and competition. Once some rudimentary elements of a money market have been developed, it will be important for the central bank to move ahead with a more aggressive banking system reserve management policy, using the lever of open-market operations against the fulcrum of reserve requirements. Extreme caution will be needed in any further expansion of offshore finance in Aruba. Numerical targets for the expansion of such activities will be difficult to meet without compromising the quality of these activities. Plans for improvements in economic statistics, including the development of national accounts, and more accurate public expenditure data, are welcome; further improvements will be needed to provide an adequate statistical basis for economic policymaking and surveillance; these include the preparation of data on wages and on prices of tourist services, needed to assess Aruba's competitiveness. It is anticipated that the next Article IV consultation discussions with Aruba will be held on the 24-month cycle.

The initial par value of the Netherlands Antillean guilder which at the time also circulated on Aruba--NA f. 1.88585 - US$l--was established with the Fund on December 18, 1946. The authorities communicated to the Fund a rate of NA f. 1.79 per US$l to take effect as a central rate on December 23, 1971. Since then, the Netherlands Antillean guilder has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at this rate. With the separation from the Netherlands Antilles and the acquisition of an autonomous status (status aparte) within the Kingdom of the Netherlands on January 1, 1986, Aruba introduced its own currency, the Aruban florin, which is also pegged to the U.S. dollar at Af. 1.79 per US$l. In setting up a new central bank and introducing a new currency, Aruba obtained extensive technical assistance from the Fund's Central Banking Department. Moreover, a Statistical Review Mission of the Bureau of Statistics provided technical assistance in the area of the organization of fundamental statistics. Finally, in 1989 a special mission of the Fiscal Affairs Department submitted a report on the scope and nature of a possible tax reform. The Board concluded the last Article IV consultation discussions for Aruba on May 28, 1993 (EBM/93/77) on the basis of staff report SM/93/97 (5/6/93) and recent economic developments SM/93/107 (5/H/93).

Aruba has received technical assistance in this area in the past, and will continue to receive assistance in the future, mainly from the Netherlands. The authorities are fully cooperative in providing data to the Fund, and available data are provided to the Fund with a two-month lag on average. Aruba has very few statistical publications, most of which are prepared by the Central Bank. 1. National accounts No national accounting data are available. Missions make their own estimates of the national accounts, based on a model that is shared with the Central Bank. These estimates give a useful general picture of longer-term output movements, but year-to-year movements are more unreliable. The Central Bureau of Statistics will start work on the construction of national acccmnts early next year. 2. Prices Consumer price data are collated by the Central Bureau of Statistics, based on a household survey it conducts periodically. However, the price changes of a number of items (notably housing rents) are imposed by assumption. Estimates of the GDP deflator are constructed by the mission on the basis of the CPI. No data on wages exist. 3. Government finance statistics Data on government revenue are reliable and available on a monthly basis. On the other hand, government expenditure data are calculated as a cash residual from the balance of the government's account with the banking system. Work is currently under way to provide a presentation of government expenditure on an accrual basis. The relevant figures are already available for 1991, while those for 1993 and 1994 are expected to be ready during the next few months. 4. Monetarv statistics Monthly data are provided on the Central Bank balance sheet and the monetary survey with about a two-month lag. The coverage of banks in the monetary survey is comprehensive. While the coverage of the banking system is good, the assessment of monetary conditions is complicated by the high degree of dollarization of the economy and the fact that no quantitative information is available on the volume of cash dollars in circulation. 5. Balance of oavments statistics Foreian trade anl invisibles transactions data on a quarterly basis are provided by the Central Bank with about a two-month lag.
