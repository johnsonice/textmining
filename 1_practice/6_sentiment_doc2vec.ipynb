      "i had the tv on for a white noise companion and heard\" $400 for a fully furnished apartment\" so i ran into the tv room expecting another 70's flick and got much more . luckily , i could rewind to the beginning ( dvr buffer ) and hit the record button to watch it entirely . ( cinemax uncut and in hd no less ! ) aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog/events , this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch . pretty creepy and progressive at times : beverly d'angelo's character masturbates in front of alison parker , played adroitly by cristina raines , parker stabs , in very gory fashion , her father , an explicit menage a trios scene . ( don't let the kids watch ) the film is totally 70's full of bad clothes ( polyester suits and tacky ascots ) and decor , bad hair , over bloated music score , and familiar looking cinematography . the cast is excellent , take a second on this film's home page to check it out . it was a surprise to see christopher walken , jerry orbach and jeff goldblum so young . sylvia miles- always wonderfully creepy ! enjoy ! \n",

      "this is essentially a variation on house of wax , in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies , vincent price . in both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by other , less talented and less scrupulous people . in this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist , the great rinaldo ( john emery ) insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designs . price is already ill disposed towards rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi . he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer . price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathy . the rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease . good solid b movie melodrama , this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't expect a masterpiece . shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance\n"
